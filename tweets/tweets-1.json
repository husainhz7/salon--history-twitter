 "Nothing is more to be feared than ill fame. One should not seek attention through violent threats or risky investments. Moderation curbs all vices, including lustful desires. Let us instead aim for self-control and dominion over ourselves. #WisdomFromTheRenaissance"

 "Another day, another news cycle filled with ignorance and foolishness. Why do we continue to rely on what is easy and commonly accepted rather than sound reason? Perhaps it is time to educate the unjust rather than execute them. After all, corpses are of no use to us. #philosophy #education"

 In my youth, I learned the value of hard work and ingenuity, even as a candy butcher on the Grand Trunk. But these days, I'm appalled at the violence and threats in society. Let's work together to find better solutions. #peace #innovation #progress

 In these days of democratic government, the fate of nations hangs on themselves. The problem of pacifism is real, and we must actively work towards international peace. Let us not leave the struggle against armaments to the governments.

 Violence only begets more violence, it is a vicious cycle. We must refuse to submit to official violence and instead exercise restraint and patience. Non-cooperation may be a better method. History has shown that terrorism has failed to impose the terrorist's will upon their victim. #Nonviolence #Resistance #Patience #Restraint

 The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is proof that risky investments lead to disastrous consequences. The government must protect the people's money at all costs. #financialresponsibility #protectdepositors #lessonslearned

 In my day, people faced death for upholding justice. Today, they face gun charges for threatening it. #SadSignOfTheTimes #JusticeNeeded
