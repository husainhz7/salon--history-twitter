PROEM 

If  indeed  I  have  no  power  to  quote  from  authors  as  they  have,  it  is  a 
far  bigger  and  more  worthy  thing  to  read  by  the  light  of  experience, 
which  is  the  instructress  of  their  masters.  They  strut  about  puffed  up 
and  pompous,  decked  out  and  adorned  not  with  their  own  labours  but 
by  those  of  others,  and  they  will  not  even  allow  me  my  own.  And  if 
they  despise  me  who  am  an  inventor  how  much  more  should  blame  be 
given  to  themselves,  who  are  not  inventors  but  trumpeters  and  reciters 
of  the  works  of  others? 


Those  who  are  inventors  and  interpreters  between  Nature  and  Man 
as  compared  with  the  reciters  and  trumpeters  of  the  works  of  others, 
are  to  be  considered  simply  as  is  an  object  in  front  of  a  mirror  in 
comparison  with  its  image  when  seen  in  the  mirror,  the  one  being 
something  in  itself,  the  other  nothing:  people  whose  debt  to  nature  is 
small,  for  it  seems  only  by  chance  that  they  wear  human  form,  and 
but  for  this  one  might  class  them  with  the  herds  of  beasts. 

c.a.  117  r.  b 

Seeing  that  I  cannot  choose  any  subject  of  great  utility  or  pleasure, 
because  my  predecessors  have  already  taken  as  their  own  all  useful 
and  necessary  themes,  I  will  do  like  one  who,  because  of  his  poverty, 
is  the  last  to  arrive  at  the  fair,  and  not  being  able  otherwise  to  provide 
himself,  chooses  all  the  things  which  others  have  already  looked  over 
and  not  taken,  but  refused  as  being  of  little  value.  With  these  despised 
and  rejected  wares — the  leavings  of  many  buyers — I  will  load  my 
modest  pack,  and  therewith  take  my  course,  distributing,  not  indeed 
amid  the  great  cities,  but  among  the  mean  hamlets,  and  taking  such 
reward  as  befits  the  things  I  offer. 

I  am  fully  aware  that  the  fact  of  my  not  being  a  man  of  letters  may 
cause  certain  arrogant  persons  to  think  that  they  may  with  reason

censure  me,  alleging  that  I  am  a  man  ignorant  of  book-learning.  Fool- 
ish folk!  Do  they  not  know  that  I  might  retort  by  saying,  as  did 
Marius  to  the  Roman  Patricians:  'They  who  themselves  go  about 
adorned  in  the  labour  of  others  will  not  permit  me  my  own'?  They 
will  say  that  because  of  my  lack  of  book-learning,  I  cannot  properly 
express  what  I  desire  to  treat  of.  Do  they  not  know  that  my  subjects 
require  for  their  exposition  experience  rather  than  the  words  of  others  ? 
And  since  experience  has  been  the  mistress  of  whoever  has  written 
well,  I  take  her  as  my  mistress,  and  to  her  in  all  points  make  my 
appeal. 

Many  will  believe  that  they  can  with  reason  censure  me,  alleging 
that  my  proofs  are  contrary  to  the  authority  of  certain  men  who  are 
held  in  great  reverence  by  their  inexperienced  judgments,  not  taking 
into  account  that  my  conclusions  were  arrived  at  as  a  result  of  simple 
and  plain  experience,  which  is  the  true  mistress. 

These  rules  enable  you  to  discern  the  true  from  the  false,  and  thus 
to  set  before  yourselves  only  things  possible  and  of  more  moderation; 
and  they  forbid  you  to  use  a  cloak  of  ignorance,  which  will  bring 
about  that  you  attain  to  no  result  and  in  despair  abandon  yourself  to 
melancholy. 

The  natural  desire  of  good  men  is  knowledge. 

I  know  that  many  will  call  this  a  useless  work,  and  they  will  be 
those  of  whom  Demetrius  said  that  he  took  no  more  account  of  the 
wind  that  produced  the  words  in  their  mouths  than  of  the  wind  that 
came  out  of  their  hinder  parts:  men  whose  only  desire  is  for  material 
riches  and  luxury  and  who  are  entirely  destitute  of  the  desire  of  wis- 
dom, the  sustenance  and  the  only  true  riches  of  the  soul.  For  as  the 
soul  is  more  worthy  than  the  body  so  much  are  the  soul's  riches 
more  worthy  than  those  of  the  body.  And  often  when  I  see  one  of 
these  men  take  this  work  in  hand  I  wonder  whether  he  will  not  put 
it  to  his  nose  like  the  ape,  and  ask  me  whether  it  is  something  to  eat.

reader,  blame  me  not,  because  the  subjects  are  many,  and  the  memory 
cannot  retain  them  and  say  'this  I  will  not  write  because  I  have  already 
written  it'.  And  if  I  wished  to  avoid  falling  into  this  mistake  it  would 
be  necessary,  in  order  to  prevent  repetition,  that  on  every  occasion 
when  I  wished  to  transcribe  a  passage  I  should  always  read  over  all  the 
preceding  portion,  and  this  especially  because  long  periods  of  time 
elapse  between  one  time  of  writing  and  another.  b.m.  i  r. 


Philosophy 

'Nature  is  full  of  infinite  causes  which  were 
never  set  forth  in  experience! 

We  have  no  lack  of  system  or  device  to  measure  and  to  parcel  out 
these  poor  days  of  ours;  wherein  it  should  be  our  pleasure  that  they  be 
not  squandered  or  suffered  to  pass  away  in  vain,  and  without  meed  of 
honour,  leaving  no  record  of  themselves  in  the  minds  of  men;  to  the 
end  that  this  our  poor  course  may  not  be  sped  in  vain.  c.a.  12  v.  a 

Our  judgment  does  not  reckon  in  their  exact  and  proper  order  things 
which  have  come  to  pass  at  different  periods  of  time;  for  many  things 
which  happened  many  years  ago  will  seem  nearly  related  to  the  present, 
and  many  things  that  are  recent  will  seem  ancient,  extending  back  to 
the  far-off  period  of  our  youth.  And  so  it  is  with  the  eye,  with  regard 
to  distant  things,  which  when  illumined  by  the  sun  seem  near  to  the 
eye,  while  many  things  which  are  near  seem  far  ofif.  c.a.  29  v.  a 

Supreme  happiness  will  be  the  greatest  cause  of  misery,  and  the  per- 
fection of  wisdom  the  occasion  of  folly.  c.a.  39  v.  c 

Every  part  is  disposed  to  unite  with  the  whole,  that  it  may  thereby 
escape  from  its  own  incompleteness. 

The  soul  desires  to  dwell  with  the  body  because  without  the  mem- 
bers of  that  body  it  can  neither  act  nor  feel.  c.a.  59  r.  b

Leonardo  was  in  the  habit  of  paying  the  price  demanded  by  the  owners  of  captive  birds 
simply  for  the  pleasure  of  setting  them  free.

little  by  little,  in  slow  death!  Helen,  when  she  looked  in  her  mirror 
and  saw  the  withered  wrinkles  which  old  age  had  made  in  her  face, 
wept,  and  wondered  to  herself  why  ever  she  had  twice  been  carried 
away.

The  age  as  it  flies  glides  secretly  and  deceives  one  and  another;

1  Gerolamo  Calvi  has  shown  in  an  article  in  the  Archivio  Storico  Lombardo,  Anno 
XLIX  (191 6)  Fasc.  Ill  that  the  source  of  this  passage  is  to  be  found  in  Ovid's  Meta- 
morphoses,   Book   XV,   lines    232-6: 

Tlet   quoque,   ut   in    speculo   rugas   aspexit   aniles 
Tyndaris,  et  secum,  cur  sit  bis  rapta,  requirit. 
Tempus  edax  rerum,  tuque,  invidiosa  vetustas, 
Omnia    destruitis,    vitiataque   dentibus   aevi 
Paulatim  lenta  consumitis  omnia  morte.' 

'Helen  also  weeps  when  she  sees  her  aged  wrinkles  in  the  looking-glass,  and  tearfully 
asks  herself  why  she  should  twice  have  been  a  lover's  prey.  O  Time,  thou  great  de- 
vourer,  and  thou,  envious  Age,  together  you  destroy  all  things;  and,  slowly  gnawing 
with  your  teeth,  you  finally  consume  all   things  in  lingering  death!'    (Loeb.) 

The  passage  as  it  appears  in  the  Codice  Atlantico  serves  to  show  how  Leonardo  in 
borrowing  enriched  the  Roman  poet's  thought  with  the  melody  of  music  by  intro- 
ducing the  apostrophe  to  time  and  envious  age  as  prelude  as  well  as  finale: 

'O  tempo,  consumatore  delle  cose,  e  o  invidiosa  antichita,  tu  distruggi  tutte  le  cose  e 
consumi  tutte  le  cose  da  duri  denti  della  vecchiezza  a  poco  a  poco  con  lenta  morte! 

Elena  quando  si  specchiava,  vedendo  le  vizze  grinze  del  suo  viso,  fatte  per  la 
vecchiezza,  piagnie  e  pensa  seco,  perche  fu  rapita  due  volte. 

O  tempo,  consumatore  delle  cose,  e  o  invidiosa  antichita,  per  la  quale  tutte  le  cose 
sono  consumate.' 

Immediately  below  this  passage  Leonardo  wrote  these  words:  'this  book  belongs 
to  Michele  di  Francesco  Bernabini  and  his  family'.  It  is  a  reasonable  inference  that  they 
refer  to  the  copy  of  Ovid  from  which  the  lines  were  taken.  Farther  below  in  writing  of 
the  same  time  is  a  fragment:  'tell,  tell  me  how  things  are  passing  yonder  and  whether 
Caterina  wishes  to  make  .  .  .' 

Caterina  was  the  name  of  Leonardo's  mother.  He  wrote  the  name  when  his  thoughts 
had  just  been  turning  to  the  poet's  description  of  the  changes  that  time  had  made  in 
Helen's  beauty.  From  this  has  arisen  the  conjecture — it  is  nothing  more! — that  the 
sentence  refers  to  her  and  that  he  was  making  some  provision  for  her  in  her  old  age.

memory  wherewith  Nature  has  endowed  us  causes  everything  long 
past  to  seem  present. 

Whoever  would  see  in  what  state  the  soul  dwells  within  the  body, 
let  him  mark  how  this  body  uses  its  daily  habitation,  for  if  this  be  con- 
fused and  without  order  the  body  will  be  kept  in  disorder  and  confu- 
sion by  the  soul.  c.a.  76  r.  a 

O  thou  that  sleepest,  what  is  sleep?  Sleep  is  an  image  of  death.  Oh, 
why  not  let  your  work  be  such  that  after  death  you  become  an  image 
of  immortality;  as  in  life  you  become  when  sleeping  like  unto  the  hap- 
less dead. 

Man  and  the  animals  are  merely  a  passage  and  channel  for  food,  a 
tomb  for  other  animals,  a  haven  for  the  dead,  giving  life  by  the  death 
of  others,  a  coffer  full  of  corruption.  c.a.  76  v.  a 

Behold  a  thing  which  the  more  need  there  is  of  it  is  the  more  re-

have  fear  of  it  and  the  more  you  flee  from  it  comes  the  nearer  to  you : 
this  is  misery,  which  the  more  you  flee  from  it  makes  you  the  more 
wretched  and  without  rest.  c.a.  80  v.  a 

Experience  the  interpreter  between  resourceful  nature  and  the  hu-

Experience  is  never  at  fault;  it  is  only  your  judgment  that  is  in  error 
in  promising  itself  such  results  from  experience  as  are  not  caused  by 
our  experiments.  For  having  given  a  beginning,  what  follows  from  it 
must  necessarily  be  a  natural  development  of  such  a  beginning,  unless 
it  has  been  subject  to  a  contrary  influence,  while,  if  it  is  affected  by  any 
contrary  influence,  the  result  which  ought  to  follow  from  the  aforesaid 
beginning  will  be  found  to  partake  of  this  contrary  influence  in  a 
greater  or  less  degree  in  proportion  as  the  said  influence  is  more  or  less 
powerful  than  the  aforesaid  beginning.  c.a.  154  r.  h 

Experience  is  not  at  fault;  it  is  only  our  judgment  that  is  in  error  in 
promising  itself  from  experience  things  which  are  not  within  her 
power. 

Wrongly  do  men  cry  out  against  experience  and  with  bitter  re- 
proaches accuse  her  of  deceitfulness.  Let  experience  alone,  and  rather 
turn  your  complaints  against  your  own  ignorance,  which  causes  you 
to  be  so  carried  away  by  your  vain  and  insensate  desires  as  to  expect 
from  experience  things  which  are  not  within  her  power!

O  mathematicians,  throw  light  on  this  error. 

The  spirit  has  no  voice,  for  where  there  is  voice  there  is  a  body,  and 
where  there  is  a  body  there  is  occupation  of  space  which  prevents  the 
eye  from  seeing  things  situated  beyond  this  space;  consequently  this 
body  of  itself  fills  the  whole  surrounding  air,  that  is  by  its  images.

PHILOSOPHY  65 

The  sun  so  soon  as  ever  it  appears  in  the  east  instantly  proceeds  with 
its  rays  to  the  west;  and  these  are  made  up  of  three  incorporeal  forces, 
namely  radiance,  heat,  and  the  image  of  the  shape  which  produces 
these. 

The  eye  so  soon  as  ever  it  is  opened  beholds  all  the  stars  of  our  hemi- 
sphere. 

The  mind  passes  in  an  instant  from  the  east  to  the  west;  and  all  the 
great  incorporeal  things  resemble  these  very  closely  in  their  speed.

who  when  they  do  not  know  how  to  express  a  thing  in  its  own  proper

Nothingness  has  no  centre,  and  its  boundaries  are  nothingness. 

My  opponent  says  that  nothingness  and  a  vacuum  are  one  and  the 
same  thing,  having  indeed  two  separate  names  by  which  they  are 
called,  but  not  existing  separately  in  nature. 

The  reply  is  that  whenever  there  exists  a  vacuum  there  will  also  be 
the  space  which  surrounds  it,  but  nothingness  exists  apart  from  occupa- 
tion of  space;  it  follows  that  nothingness  and  a  vacuum  are  not  the 
same,  for  the  one  is  divisible  to  infinity,  and  nothingness  cannot  be 
divided  because  nothing  can  be  less  than  it  is;  and  if  you  were  to  take 
part  from  it  this  part  would  be  equal  to  the  whole,  and  the  whole  to

The  chief  good  is  wisdom :  the  chief  evil  is  the  suffering  of  the  body. 
Seeing  therefore  that  we  are  made  up  of  two  things,  namely  of  soul 
and  body,  of  which  the  first  is  the  better  and  the  inferior  is  the  body, 
wisdom  belongs  to  the  better  part  and  the  chief  evil  belongs  to  the 
worse  part  and  is  the  worst.  The  best  thing  in  the  soul  is  wisdom,  and 
even  so  the  worst  thing  in  the  body  is  pain.  As  therefore  the  chief  evil 
is  bodily  pain,  so  wisdom  is  the  chief  good  of  the  soul,  that  is  of  the 
wise  man,  and  nothing  else  can  be  compared  to  it.  Tr.  3  a 

The  lover  is  drawn  by  the  thing  loved,  as  the  sense  is  by  that  which 
it  perceives,  and  it  unites  with  it,  and  they  become  one  and  the  same 
thing.  The  work  is  the  first  thing  born  of  the  union;  if  the  thing  that  is 
loved  be  base,  the  lover  becomes  base.  When  the  thing  taken  into 
union  is  in  harmony  with  that  which  receives  it,  there  follow  rejoicing

68  PHILOSOPHY 

Many  times  one  and  the  same  thing  is  drawn  by  two  violences, 
namely  necessity  and  power. 

Water  falls  in  rain;  the  earth  absorbs  it  from  necessity  of  moisture; 
and  the  sun  raises  it  up  not  from  necessity  but  by  its  power. 

Tr.  70  a 

The  soul  can  never  be  infected  by  the  corruption  of  the  body,  but 
acts  in  the  body  like  the  wind  which  causes  the  sound  of  the  organ, 
wherein  if  one  of  the  pipes  becomes  spoiled  no  good  effect  can  be  pro- 
duced because  of  its  emptiness.  Tr.  71  a 

If  you  kept  your  body  in  accordance  with  virtue  your  desires  would 
not  be  of  this  world. 

You  grow  in  reputation  like  bread  in  the  hands  of  children. 

b   3   v. 

There  cannot  be  any  sound  where  there  is  no  movement  or  per- 
cussion of  the  air.  There  cannot  be  any  percussion  of  the  air  where 
there  is  no  instrument.  There  cannot  be  any  instrument  without  a 
body.  This  being  so  a  spirit  cannot  have  either  sound  or  form  or  force, 
and  if  it  should  assume  a  body  it  cannot  penetrate  or  enter  where  the 
doors  are  shut.  And  if  any  should  say  that  through  air  being  collected 
together  and  compressed  a  spirit  may  assume  bodies  of  various  shapes,, 
and  by  such  instrument  may  speak  and  move  with  force,  my  reply  to 
this  would  be  that  where  there  are  neither  nerves  nor  bones  there 
cannot  be  any  force  exerted  in  any  movement  made  by  imaginary 
spirits.  Shun  the  precepts  of  those  speculators  whose  arguments  are  not 
confirmed  by  experience.  b  4  v. 

OF  WHAT  FORCE  IS 

Force  I  define  as  a  spiritual  power,  incorporeal  and  invisible,  which 
with  brief  life  is  produced  in  those  bodies  which  as  the  result  of  acci- 
dental violence  are  brought  out  of  their  natural  state  and  condition. 

I  have  said  spiritual  because  in  this  force  there  is  an  active,  incor- 
poreal life;  and  I  call  it  invisible  because  the  body  in  which  it  is 
created  does  not  increase  either  in  weight  or  in  size;  and  of  brief  dura-

THE  CONFIGURATION  OF  THE  ELEMENTS 

Of  the  configuration  of  the  elements  and  first  against  those  who 
deny  the  opinion  of  Plato,  saying  that  if  these  elements  invest  one  an- 
other in  the  shapes  which  Plato  attributed  to  them  a  vacuum  would  be 
occasioned  between  one  and  the  other  which  is  not  true.  I  prove  this 
here  but  first  of  all  it  is  necessary  to  set  forth  certain  conclusions. 

It  is  not  necessary  for  any  of  the  elements  which  invest  one  another 
to  be  of  equal  size  in  all  its  extent  as  between  the  part  that  invests  and 
that  which  is  invested.  We  see  that  the  sphere  of  the  water  is  mani- 
festly of  different  degrees  of  thickness  from  its  surface  to  its  base,  and 
that  it  would  not  only  cover  the  earth  if  it  had  the  shape  of  a  cube 
that  is  of  eight  angles  as  Plato  would  have  it,  but  it  covers  the  earth 
having  innumerable  angles  of  rocks  covered  by  the  water  and  various 
protuberances  and  hollows  without  creating  any  vacuum  between  the 
water  and  the  earth.  Moreover  as  regards  the  air  which  clothes  the 
sphere  of  the  water  together  with  the  mountains  and  valleys  which 
rise  about  this  sphere  there  is  not  left  any  vacuum  between  the  earth 
and  the  air.  So  that  whoever  has  said  that  a  vacuum  is  there  produced 
has  spoken  foolishly. 

To  Plato  one  would  make  answer  that  the  surfaces  of  the  figures 
that  the  elements  would  have  according  to  him  could  not  exist. 

Every  flexible  and  liquid  element  has  of  necessity  its  spherical  sur- 
face. This  is  proved  with  the  sphere  of  water  but  first  must  be  set  forth 
certain  conceptions  and  conclusions.  That  thing  is  higher  which  is 
more  remote  from  the  centre  of  the  world,  and  that  is  lower  which  is 
nearer  this  centre.  Water  does  not  move  of  itself  unless  it  descends  and 
in  moving  itself  it  descends.  These  four  conceptions  placed  two  by  two 
serve  me  to  prove  that  water  that  does  not  move  of  itself  has  its  surface 
equidistant  to  the  centre  of  the  world,  speaking  not  of  drops  or  other 
small  quantities  that  attract  one  another  as  the  steel  its  filings,  but  of 
the  great  masses.  f  27  r.

The  other  proof  that  Plato  gave  to  those  of  Delos  is  not  geometrical,

geometrical.  f  59  r. 

Man  has  great  power  of  speech,  but  the  greater  part  thereof  is  empty

You  who  speculate  on  the  nature  of  things,  I  praise  you  not  for 
knowing  the  processes  which  nature  ordinarily  effects  of  herself,  but

conceives.  g  47  r. 

Words  which  fail  to  satisfy  the  ear  of  the  listener  always  either 
fatigue  or  weary  him;  and  you  may  often  see  a  sign  of  this  when  such 
listeners  are  frequently  yawning.  Consequently  when  addressing  men 
whose  good  opinion  you  desire,  either  cut  short  your  speech  when  you 
see  these  evident  signs  of  impatience,  or  else  change  the  subject;  for  if 
you  take  any  other  course,  then  in  place  of  the  approbation  you  desire 
you  will  win  dislike  and  ill-will. 

And  if  you  would  see  in  what  a  man  takes  pleasure  without  hearing 
him  speak,  talk  to  him  and  change  the  subject  of  your  discourse  sev- 
eral times,  and  when  it  comes  about  that  you  see  him  stand  fixedly 
without  either  yawning  or  knitting  his  brows  or  making  any  other 
movement,  then  be  sure  that  the  subject  of  which  you  are  speaking  is 
the  one  in  which  he  takes  pleasure.  g  49  r.

stroyed,— the  living  organisms  which  have  no  power  of  movement 
do  not  have  to  encounter  opposing  objects,  and  plants  consequently 
do  not  need  to  have  a  sensibility  to  pain,  and  so  it  comes  about  that 
if  you  break  them  they  do  not  feel  anguish  in  their  members  as  do  the

OF  THE  SOUL 

Movement  of  earth  against  earth  pressing  down  upon  it  causes  a 
slight  movement  of  the  parts  struck. 

Water  struck  by  water  creates  circles  at  a  great  distance  round  the 
spot  where  it  is  struck;  the  voice  in  the  air  goes  further,  in  fire  further 
still;  mind  ranges  over  the  universe  but  being  finite  it  does  not  extend 
into  infinity.  h  67  [19]  r. 

[Parallel  of  organism  of  nature  and  man] 

The  water  which  rises  in  the  mountains  is  the  blood  which  keeps 
the  mountain  in  life.  If  one  of  its  veins  be  open  either  internally  or  at 
the  side,  nature,  which  assists  its  organisms,  abounding  in  increased 
desire  to  overcome  the  scarcity  of  moisture  thus  poured  out  is  prodigal 
there  in  diligent  aid,  as  also  happens  with  the  place  at  which  a  man 
has  received  a  blow.  For  one  sees  then  how  as  help  comes  the  blood 
increases  under  the  skin  in  the  form  of  a  swelling  in  order  to  open  the 
infected  part.  Similarly  life  being  severed  at  the  topmost  extremity  (of 
the  mountain)  nature  sends  her  fluid  from  its  lowest  foundations  up 
to  the  greatest  height  of  the  severed  passage,  and  as  this  is  poured  out 
there  it  does  not  leave  it  bereft  of  vital  fluid  down  to  the  end  of  its  life.

these  cloths  they  sufifer  corruption.

until  it  commences  to  soften  and  become  corrupt;  and  it  is  this  which

PHILOSOPHY  73 

The  earth  is  moved  from  its  position  by  the  weight  of  a  tiny  bird

b.m.   120  r. 

That  which  is  termed  nothingness  is  found  only  in  time  and  speech. 
In  time  it  is  found  between  the  past  and  the  future  and  retains  nothing 
of  the  present;  in  speech  likewise  when  the  things  spoken  of  do  not 
exist  or  are  impossible. 

In  the  presence  of  nature  nothingness  is  not  found:  it  has  its  asso- 
ciates among  the  things  impossible  whence  for  this  reason  it  has  no 
existence. 

In  the  presence  of  time  nothingness  dwells  between  the  past  and  the 
future  and  possesses  nothing  of  the  present;  and  in  the  presence  of 
nature  it  finds  its  associates  among  things  impossible,  whence  for  this 
reason  it  is  said  that  it  has  no  existence.  For  where  nothingness  existed 
there  would  be  a  vacuum. 

Amid  the  immensity  of  the  things  about  us  the  existence  of  nothing- 
ness holds  the  first  place,  and  its  function  extends  over  the  things  that 
have  no  existence,  and  its  essence  dwells  in  respect  of  time  between 
past  and  future,  and  possesses  nothing  of  the  present.  This  nothingness 
has  the  part  equal  to  the  whole  and  the  whole  to  the  part,  the  divisible 
to  the  indivisible,  and  its  power  does  not  extend  among  the  things  of 
nature,  for  inasmuch  as  this  abhors  a  vacuum  this  nothingness  loses  its 
essence  because  the  end  of  one  thing  is  the  beginning  of  another. 

It  is  possible  to  conceive  everything  that  has  substance  as  divisible 
into  an  infinite  number  of  parts. 

Amid  the  greatness  of  the  things  around  us  the  existence  of  noth- 
ingness holds  the  first  place,  and  its  function  extends  among  the  things 
which  have  no  existence,  and  its  essence  dwells  as  regards  time  between 
the  past  and  the  future,  and  possesses  nothing  of  the  present.  This 
nothingness  has  the  part  equal  to  the  whole  and  the  whole  to  the  part, 
the  divisible  to  the   indivisible,  and   it  comes   to   the  same   amount

\Of  the  end  of  the  world] 

The  watery  element  remaining  pent  up  within  the  raised  banks  of 
the  rivers  and  the  shores  of  the  sea,  it  will  come  to  pass  with  the  up- 
heaval of  the  earth  that  as  the  encircling  air  has  to  bind  and  circum- 
scribe the  complicated  structure  of  the  earth,  its  mass  which  was  be- 
tween the  water  and  the  fiery  element  will  be  left  straitly  compassed 
about  and  deprived  of  the  necessary  supply  of  water. 

The  rivers  will  remain  without  their  waters;  the  fertile  earth  will 
put  forth  no  more  her  budding  branches;  the  fields  will  be  decked  no 
more  with  waving  corn.  All  the  animals  will  perish,  failing  to  find 
fresh  grass  for  fodder;  and  the  ravening  lions  and  wolves  and  other 
beasts  which  live  by  prey  will  lack  sustenance;  and  it  will  come  about 
after  many  desperate  shifts  that  men  will  be  forced  to  adandon  their 
life  and  the  human  race  will  cease  to  be. 

And  in  this  way  the  fertile  fruitful  earth  being  deserted  will  be  left 
arid  and  sterile,  and  through  the  pent  up  moisture  of  the  water  en- 
closed within  its  womb  and  by  the  activity  of  its  nature  it  will  follow 
in  part  its  law  of  growth  until  having  passed  through  the  cold  and 
rarefied  air  it  will  be  forced  to  end  its  course  in  the  element  of  fire. 
Then  the  surface  of  it  will  remain  burnt  to  a  cinder,  and  this  will  be 
the  end  of  all  terrestrial  nature.  b.m.  155  v. 

[A  disputation] 

Against. — Why  nature  did  not  ordain  that  one  animal  should  not 
live  by  the  death  of  another. 

For. — Nature  being  capricious  and  taking  pleasure  in  creating  and 
producing  a  continuous  succession  of  lives  and  forms  because  she 
knows  that  they  serve  to  increase  her  terrestrial  substance,  is  more 
ready  and  swift  in  creating  than  time  is  in  destroying,  and  therefore 
she  has  ordained  that  many  animals  shall  serve  as  food  one  for  the 
other;  and  as  this  does  not  satisfy  her  desire  she  sends  forth  frequently 
certain  noisome  and  pestilential  vapours  and  continual  plagues  upon 
the  vast  accumulations  and  herds  of  animals  and  especially  upon  hu- 


PHILOSOPHY  75 

man  beings  who  increase  very  rapidly  because  other  animals  do  not 
feed  upon  them;  and  if  the  causes  are  taken  away  the  results  will  cease. 

Against. — Therefore  this  earth  seeks  to  lose  its  life  while  desiring 
continual  reproduction  for  the  reason  brought  forth,  and  demonstrated 
to  you.  Effects  often  resemble  their  causes.  The  animals  serve  as  a  type 
of  the  life  of  the  world. 

For. — Behold  now  the  hope  and  desire  of  going  back  to  one's  own 
country  or  returning  to  primal  chaos,  like  that  of  the  moth  to  the  light, 
of  the  man  who  with  perpetual  longing  always  looks  forward  with  joy 
to  each  new  spring  and  each  new  summer,  and  to  the  new  months  and 
the  new  years,  deeming  that  the  things  he  longs  for  are  too  slow  in 
coming;  and  who  does  not  perceive  that  he  is  longing  for  his  own 
destruction.  But  this  longing  is  in  its  quintessence  the  spirit  of  the 
elements,  which  finding  itself  imprisoned  within  the  life  of  the  human 
body  desires  continually  to  return  to  its  source. 

And  I  would  have  you  to  know  that  this  same  longing  is  in  its 
quintessence  inherent  in  nature,  and  that  man  is  a  type  of  the  world.

Therefore  the  end  of  nothingness  and  the  beginning  of  the  line  are 
in  contact jjne^vith  another,  but  they  are  not  joined  together,  and  in 
such  contact  is  thepomrTwhich  divides  the  continuation  of  nothing- 
ness and  the  line. 

It  follows  that  the  point  is  less  than  nothing,  and  if  all  the  parts  of 
nothingness  are  equal  to  one  we  may  the  more  conclude  that  all  the 
points  also  are  equal  to  one  single  point  and  one  point  is  equal  to  all. 

And  from  this  it  follows  that  many  points  imagined  in  continuous 
contact  do  not  constitute  the  line,  and  as  a  consequence  many  lines  in 
continuous  contact  as  regards  their  sides  do  not  make  a  surface,  nor  do 
many  surfaces  in  continuous  contact  make  a  body,  because  among  us 
bodies  are  not  formed  of  incorporeal  things. 

The  point  is  that  which  has  no  centre  because  it  is  all  centre,  and 
nothing  can  be  less. 

The  contact  of  the  liquid  with  the  solid  is  a  surface  common  to  the 
liquid  and  to  the  solid,  and  the  lighter  liquids  with  the  heavier  have 
the  same. 

All  the  points  are  equal  to  one  and  one  to  all. 


j6  PHILOSOPHY 

Nothingness  has  a  surface  in  common  with  a  thing  and  the  thing 
has  a  surface  in  common  with  nothingness,  and  the  surface  of  a  thing 
is  not  part  of  this  thing.  It  follows  that  the  surface  of  nothingness  is 
not  part  of  this  nothingness;  it  must  needs  be  therefore  that  a  mere 
surface  is  the  common  boundary  of  two  things  that  are  in  contact; 
thus  the  surface  of  water  does  not  form  part  of  the  water  nor  conse- 
quently does  it  form  part  of  the  atmosphere,  nor  are  any  other  bodies 
interposed  between  them.  What  is  it  therefore  that  divides  the  atmos- 
phere from  the  water?  It  is  necessary  that  there  should  be  a  common 
boundary  which  is  neither  air  nor  water  but  is  without  substance,  be- 
cause a  body  interposed  between  two  bodies  prevents  their  contact,  and 
this  does  not  happen  in  water  with  air  because  they  are  in  contact 
without  the  interposition  of  any  medium. 

Therefore  they  are  joined  together  and  you  cannot  raise  up  or  move 
the  air  without  the  water,  nor  will  you  be  able  to  raise  up  the  flat  thing 
from  the  other  without  drawing  it  back  through  the  air.  Therefore  a 
surface  is  the  common  boundary  of  two  bodies  which  are  not  con- 
tinuous, and  does  not  form  part  of  either  one  or  the  other  for  if  the 
surface  formed  part  of  it  it  would  have  divisible  bulk,  whereas  how- 
ever it  is  not  divisible  and  nothingness  divides  these  bodies  the  one 
from  the  other.  b.m.  159  v. 


OF  TIME  AS  A  CONTINUOUS  QUANTITY 

Although  time  is  numbered  among  continuous  quantities  yet 
through  its  being  invisible  and  without  substance  it  does  not  alto- 
gether fall  under  the  category  of  geometrical  terms,  which  are  divided 
in  figures  and  bodies  of  infinite  variety,  as  may  constantly  be  seen  to 
be  the  case  with  things  visible  and  things  of  substance;  but  it  harmo- 
nises with  these  only  as  regards  its  first  principles,  namely  as  to  the 
point  and  the  line.  The  point  as  viewed  in  terms  of  time  is  to  be  com- 
pared with  the  instant,  and  the  line  resembles  the  length  of  a  quantity 
of  time.  And  just  as  points  are  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  said  line 
so  instants  form  the  end  and  the  beginning  of  a  certain  given  space 
of  time.  And  if  a  line  be  divisible  to  infinity  it  is  not  impossible  for  a 
space  of  time  to  be  so  divided.  And  if  the  divided  parts  of  a  line  may

DISCOURSE 

Heat  and  cold  proceed  from  the  propinquity  and  remoteness  of  the 
sun. 

Heat  and  cold  produce  the  movement  of  the  elements. 

No  element  has  of  itself  gravity  or  levity. 

Gravity  and  levity  without  increase  arise  from  the  movement  of  the 
element  in  itself  in  its  rarefaction  and  condensation,  as  we  see  happen 
in  the  atmosphere  in  the  creation  of  clouds  by  means  of  the  moisture 
which  is  diffused  through  it. 

Gravity  and  levity  when  increased  proceed  along  a  perpendicular 
line  from  one  element  to  another.  And  these  unforseen  events  have  as 
much  more  power  as  they  have  more  of  life,  and  as  much  more  of 
life  as  they  have  more  of  movement. 

The  movement  originates  in  the  fact  that  what  is  thinner  can  neither 
resist  nor  support  above  it  what  is  more  dense. 

Levity  is  born  of  gravity  and  gravity  of  levity;  repaying  in  the  same 
instant  the  boon  of  their  creation  they  grow  the  more  in  power  as  they 
grow  in  life  and  have  the  more  life  in  proportion  as  they  have  more 
movement;  in  the  same  instant  also  they  destroy  one  another  in  the 
common  vendetta  of  their  death. 

For  so  it  is  proved:  levity  is  not  created  unless  it  is  in  conjunction 
with  gravity,  nor  is  gravity  produced  unless  it  is  continued  in  levity. 
But  the  levity  has  no  existence  unless  it  is  underneath  gravity,  and 
gravity  is  as  nothing  unless  it  is  above  levity.  And  so  it  is  with  the 
elements.  If  for  example  a  quantity  of  air  lay  beneath  water  then  it 
follows  that  the  water  immediately  acquires  gravity;  not  that  it  is 
changed  from  its  first  condition  but  because  it  does  not  meet  with  the 
due  amount  of  resistance;  it  therefore  descends  into  the  position  oc- 


78  PHILOSOPHY 

cupied  by  the  air  which  was  beneath  it  and  the  air  fills  up  the  vacuum 
which  the  gravity  so  created  has  left  in  it.  b.m.  204  r. 

Every  continuous  quantity  is  infinitely  divisible;  therefore  the  di- 
vision of  this  quantity  will  never  result  in  a  point  which  is  given  as  the 
extremity  of  a  line.  It  follows  that  the  breadth  and  depth  of  the  natural 
line  is  divisible  to  infinity. 

It  is  asked  whether  all  the  infinites  are  equal  or  whether  they  are 
greater  the  one  than  the  other.  The  answer  is  that  every  infinite  is 
eternal  and  eternal  things  are  of  equal  permanence  but  not  of  equal 
length  of  existence.  For  that  which  functioned  first  commenced  to 
divide  and  has  passed  a  longer  existence,  but  the  periods  to  come  are 
equal.  b.m.  204  v. 

No  element  has  in  itself  gravity  or  levity  unless  it  moves.  The  earth 
is  in  contact  with  the  water  and  with  the  air  and  has  of  itself  neither 
gravity  nor  levity.  It  has  no  consciousness  of  the  water  or  air  which 
surrounds  it  except  by  accident  which  arises  from  their  movement. 
And  this  we  learn  from  the  leaves  of  plants  which  grow  upon  the  earth 
when  it  is  in  contact  with  water  or  air,  for  they  do  not  bend  except  by 
the  movement  of  the  air  or  water. 

From  the  foregoing  we  should  say  that  gravity  is  an  incident  created 
by  the  movement  of  the  lower  elements  in  the  higher. 

Levity  is  an  incident  created  when  the  thinner  element  is  drawn 
beneath  the  less  thin  which  then  moves  being  unable  to  resist  and  then 
acquires  weight  this  being  created  so  soon  as  the  element  lacks  the 
power  of  resistance;  which  resistance  being  subdued  by  weight  it  does 
not  change  without  change  of  substance;  and  in  changing  it  acquires 
the  name  of  levity. 

Levity  is  not  produced  except  together  with  gravity,  nor  gravity 
without  levity:  this  may  be  produced:  for  let  air  be  suspended  under 
water  by  blowing  through  a  pipe,  then  this  air  will  acquire  levity  from 
being  beneath  the  water  and  the  water  will  acquire  gravity  from  hav- 
ing beneath  it  the  air  which  is  a  body  thinner  and  lighter  than  itself. 

Therefore  levity  is  born  of  weight  and  weight  of  lightness,  and  they 
give  birth  one  to  another  at  the  same  time  repaying  the  boon  of  their 
existence,  and  at  the  same  instant  they  destroy  one  another  as  the 
avengers  of  their  death. 


PHILOSOPHY  79 

Levity  and  gravity  are  caused  by  immediate  movement. 

Movement  is  created  by  heat  and  cold. 

Movement  is  an  incident  created  by  inequality  of  weight  and  force. 

The  atmosphere  has  not  of  itself  a  natural  position  and  always  closes 
up  over  a  body  that  is  thicker  than  itself,  never  over  the  lighter  when 
it  is  in  contact  with  it  except  by  violence. 

The  movement  of  the  elements  arises  from  the  sun. 

The  heat  of  the  universe  is  produced  by  the  sun. 

The  light  and  heat  of  the  universe  come  from  the  sun  and  its  cold 
and  darkness  from  the  withdrawal  of  the  sun. 

Every  movement  of  the  elements  arises  from  heat  and  cold. 

Gravity  and  levity  are  created  in  the  elements.  b.m.  205  r. 

The  earth  is  in  contact  with  the  water  and  the  air,  and  acquires  as 
much  weight  from  the  water  as  from  the  air;  and  this  is  nothing  un- 
less they  have  movement. 

This  we  may  learn  from  the  leaves  of  plants  born  in  the  depths  of 
the  water  which  lies  upon  the  meadows,  and  the  leaves  and  branches 
of  the  trees,  and  similarly  from  the  fact  of  plants  born  in  the  bed  of 
the  waters  not  bending  down  it  is  manifest  that  the  air  and  the  water 
do  not  give  their  weight  to  the  earth.  b.m.  266  v. 


EXAMPLE  OF  THE  CENTRE  OF  THE  WORLD 

Suppose  the  earth  to  be  drawn  to  the  position  of  the  moon  together 
with  the  water,  and  that  the  element  of  the  air  fills  with  itself  the 
vacuum  in  the  air  which  the  earth  in  separating  has  left  of  itself,  and 
that  from  the  air  there  falls  a  vase  full  of  air,  it  is  certain  that  this  vase 
after  many  wavering  movements,  that  is  falling  and  reflex,  will  come 
to  a  stop  at  about  the  centre  of  the  elements.  And  the  centre  of  the 
elements  will  remain  in  the  air  that  is  within  the  vase  and  it  will  not 
touch  the  vase.  Or  suppose  the  earth  hollowed  out  like  a  ball  full  of 
wind,  you  will  then  be  certain  that  this  centre  is  not  in  the  earth,  but 
in  the  air  clothed  by  the  earth.  bm.  267  r.

And  this  man  excels  in  folly  in  that  he  continually  stints  himself  in

Here  nature  seems  in  many  or  for  many  animals  to  have  been  rather

And  thou,  man,  who  by  these  my  labours  dost  look  upon  the  mar-

away  the  life  of  man.  For  thou  shouldst  be  mindful  that  though  what 
is  thus  compounded  seem  to  thee  of  marvellous  subtlety,  it  is  as  noth- 
ing compared  with  the  soul  that  dwells  within  this  structure;  and  in 
truth,  whatever  this  may  be,  it  is  a  divine  thing  which  suffers  it  thus 
to  dwell  within  its  handiwork  at  its  good  pleasure,  and  wills  not  that 
thy  rage  or  malice  should  destroy  such  a  life,  since  in  truth  he  who 
values  it  not  does  not  deserve  it. 

For  we  part  from  the  body  with  extreme  reluctance,  and  I  indeed 
believe  that  its  grief  and  lamentation  are  not  without  cause.

OF  NECROMANCY 

But  of  all  human  discourses  that  must  be  considered  as  most  foolish 
which  affirms  a  belief  in  necromancy,  which  is  the  sister  of  alchemy, 
the  producer  of  simple  and  natural  things,  but  is  so  much  the  more 
worthy  of  blame  than  alchemy,  because  it  never  gives  birth  to  any- 
thing whatever  except  to  things  like  itself,  that  is  to  say  lies;  and  this 
is  not  the  case  with  alchemy,  which  works  by  the  simple  products  of 
nature,  but  whose  function  cannot  be  exercised  by  nature  herself,  be- 
cause there  are  in  her  no  organic  instruments  with  which  she  might  be 
able  to  do  the  work  which  man  performs  with  his  hands,  by  the  use 
of  which  he  has  made  glass,  etc.  But  this  necromancy,  an  ensign  or 
flying  banner,  blown  by  the  wind,  is  the  guide  of  the  foolish  multi- 
tude, which  is  a  continual  witness  by  its  clamour  to  the  limitless  effects 
of  such  an  art.  And  they  have  filled  whole  books  in  affirming  that  en- 
chantments and  spirits  can  work  and  speak  without  tongues,  and  can 
speak  without  any  organic  instrument, — without  which  speech  is  im- 
possible,— and  can  carry  the  heaviest  weights,  and  bring  tempests  and 
rain,  and  that  men  can  be  changed  into  cats  and  wolves  and  other 
beasts,  although  those  first  become  beasts  who  affirm  such  things. 

And  undoubtedly  if  this  necromancy  did  exist,  as  is  believed  by 
shallow  minds,  there  is  nothing  on  earth  that  would  have  so  much 
power  either  to  harm  or  to  benefit  man;  if  it  were  true,  that  is,  that  by 
such  an  art  one  had  the  power  to  disturb  the  tranquil  clearness  of  the 
air,  and  transform  it  into  the  hue  of  night,  to  create  coruscations  and 
tempests  with  dreadful  thunder-claps  and  lightning-flashes  rushing 
through  the  darkness,  and  with  impetuous  storms  to  overthrow  high

buildings  and  uproot  forests,  and  with  these  to  encounter  armies  and 
break  and  overthrow  them,  and — more  important  even  than  this — to 
make  the  devastating  tempests,  and  thereby  rob  the  husbandmen  of 
the  reward  of  their  labours.  For  what  method  of  warfare  can  there  be 
which  can  inflict  such  damage  upon  the  enemy  as  the  exercise  of  the 
power  to  deprive  him  of  his  crops?  What  naval  combat  could  there  be 
which  should  compare  with  that  which  he  would  wage  who  has 
command  of  the  winds  and  can  create  ruinous  tempests  that  would 
submerge  every  fleet  whatsoever  ?  In  truth,  whoever  has  control  of  such 
irresistible  forces  will  be  lord  over  all  nations,  and  no  human  skill  will 
be  able  to  resist  his  destructive  power.  The  buried  treasures,  the  jewels 
that  lie  in  the  body  of  the  earth  will  all  become  manifest  to  him;  no 
lock,  no  fortress,  however  impregnable,  will  avail  to  save  anyone 
against  the  will  of  such  a  necromancer.  He  will  cause  himself  to  be 
carried  through  the  air  from  East  to  West,  and  through  all  the  utter- 
most parts  of  the  universe.  But  why  do  I  thus  go  on  adding  instance 
to  instance?  What  is  there  which  could  not  be  brought  to  pass  by  a 
mechanician  such  as  this?  Almost  nothing,  except  the  escaping  from 
death. 

We  have  therefore  ascertained  in  part  the  mischief  and  the  useful- 
ness that  belong  to  such  an  art  if  it  is  real;  and  if  it  is  real  why  has  it 
not  remained  among  men  who  desire  so  much,  not  having  regard  to 
any  deity,  merely  because  there  are  an  infinite  number  of  persons  who 
in  order  to  gratify  one  of  their  appetites  would  destroy  God  and  the 
whole  universe? 

If  then  it  has  never  remained  among  men,  although  so  necessary  to 
them,  it  never  existed,  and  never  can  exist,  as  follows  from  the  defini- 
tion of  a  spirit,  which  is  invisible  and  incorporeal,  for  within  the  ele- 
ments there  are  no  incorporeal  things,  because  where  there  is  not  body 
there  is  a  vacuum,  and  the  vacuum  does  not  exist  within  the  elements, 
because  it  would  be  instantly  filled  up  by  the  element.  Fogli  b.  31  v.

[The  certainty  of  mathematics} 

He  who  blames  the  supreme  certainty  of  mathematics  feeds  on  con- 
fusion, and  will  never  impose  silence  upon  the  contradictions  of  the 
sophistical  sciences,  which  occasion  a  perpetual  clamour. 

The  abbreviators  of  works  do  injury  to  knowledge  and  to  love,  for 
love  of  anything  is  the  offspring  of  knowledge,  love  being  more  fervent 
in  proportion  as  knowledge  is  more  certain;  and  this  certainty  springs 
from  a  thorough  knowledge  of  all  those  parts  which  united  compose 
the  whole  of  that  thing  which  ought  to  be  loved. 

Of  what  use,  pray,  is  he  who  in  order  to  abridge  the  part  of  the 
things  of  which  he  professes  to  give  complete  information  leaves  out 
the  greater  part  of  the  matters  of  which  the  whole  is  composed? 

True  it  is  that  impatience  the  mother  of  folly  is  she  who  praises 
brevity;  as  though  such  folk  had  not  a  span  of  life  that  would  suffice 
to  acquire  complete  knowledge  of  one  particular  subject  such  as  the 
human  body.  And  then  they  think  to  comprehend  the  mind  of  God 
which  embraces  the  whole  universe,  weighing  and  dissecting  it  as 
though  they  were  making  an  anatomy.  O  human  stupidity!  Do  you 
not  perceive  that  you  have  spent  your  whole  life  with  yourself  and  yet 
are  not  aware  of  that  which  you  have  most  in  evidence,  and  that  is 
your  own  foolishness?  And  so  with  the  crowd  of  sophists  you  think 
to  deceive  yourself  and  others,  despising  the  mathematical  sciences  in 
which  is  contained  true  information  about  the  subjects  of  which  they 
treat!  Or  you  would  fain  range  among  the  miracles  and  give  your 
views  upon  those  subjects  which  the  human  mind  is  incapable  of 
comprehending  and  which  cannot  be  demonstrated  by  any  natural 
instance.  And  it  seems  to  you  that  you  have  performed  miracles  when 


84  PHILOSOPHY 

you  have  spoiled  the  work  of  some  ingenious  mind,  and  you  do  not 
perceive  that  you  are  falling  into  the  same  error  as  does  he  who  strips 
a  tree  of  its  adornment  of  branches  laden  with  leaves  intermingled 
with  fragrant  flowers  or  fruits,  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  suitability 
of  the  tree  for  making  planks.  Even  as  did  Justinus,  maker  of  an 
epitome  of  the  histories  of  Trogus  Pompeius,  who  had  written  an 
elaborate  account  of  all  the  great  deeds  of  his  ancestors  which  lent 
themselves  to  picturesque  description,  for  by  so  doing  he  composed  a 
bald  work  fit  only  for  such  impatient  minds  as  conceive  themselves  to 
be  wasting  time  when  they  spend  it  usefully  in  study  of  the  works  of 
nature  and  of  human  things. 

Let  such  as  these  remain  in  the  company  of  the  beasts,  and  let  their 
courtiers  be  dogs  and  other  animals  eager  for  prey  and  let  them  keep 
company  with  them;  ever  pursuing  whatever  takes  flight  from  them 
they  follow  after  the  inoffensive  animals  who  in  the  season  of  the  snow 
drifts  are  impelled  by  hunger  to  approach  your  doors  to  beg  alms  from 
you  as  from  a  guardian. 

If  you  are  as  you  have  described  yourself  the  king  of  the  animals — 
it  would  be  better  for  you  to  call  yourself  king  of  the  beasts  since  you 
are  the  greatest  of  them  all! — why  do  you  not  help  them  so  that  they 
may  presendy  be  able  to  give  you  their  young  in  order  to  gratify  your 
palate,  for  the  sake  of  which  you  have  tried  to  make  yourself  a  tomb 
for  all  the  animals?  Even  more  I  might  say  if  to  speak  the  entire  truth 
were  permitted  me. 

But  do  not  let  us  quit  this  subject  without  referring  to  one  supreme 
form  of  wickedness  which  hardly  exists  among  the  animals,  among 
whom  are  none  that  devour  their  own  species  except  for  lack  of  reason 
(for  there  are  insane  among  them  as  among  human  beings  though  not 
in  such  great  numbers).  Nor  does  this  happen  except  among  the  vora- 
cious animals  as  in  the  lion  species  and  among  leopards,  panthers, 
lynxes,  cats  and  creatures  like  these,  which  sometimes  eat  their  young. 
But  not  only  do  you  eat  your  children,  but  you  eat  father,  mother, 
brothers  and  friends;  and  this  even  not  sufficing  you  you  make  raids 
on  foreign  islands  and  capture  men  of  other  races  and  then  after  muti- 
lating them  in  a  shameful  manner  you  fatten  them  up  and  cram  them 
down  your  gullet.  Say  does  not  nature  bring  forth  a  sufficiency  of 


PHILOSOPHY  85 

simple  things  to  produce  satiety?  Or  if  you  cannot  content  yourself 
with  simple  things  can  you  not  by  blending  these  together  make  an 
infinite  number  of  compounds  as  did  Platina  and  other  authors  who 
have  written  for  epicures? 

And  if  any  be  found  virtuous  and  good  drive  them  not  away  from 
you  but  do  them  honour  lest  they  flee  from  you  and  take  refuge  in 
hermitages  and  caves  or  other  solitary  places  in  order  to  escape  from 
your  deceits.  If  any  such  be  found  pay  him  reverence,  for  as  these  are 
as  gods  upon  the  earth  they  deserve  statues,  images  and  honours.  But  I 
would  impress  upon  you  that  their  images  are  not  to  be  eaten  by  you, 
as  happens  in  a  certain  district  of  India;  for  there,  when  in  the  judg- 
ment of  the  priests  these  images  have  worked  some  miracle,  they  cut 
them  in  pieces  being  of  wood  and  distribute  them  to  all  the  people  of 
the  locality — not  without  payment. 

And  each  of  them  then  grates  his  portion  very  fine  and  spreads  it 
over  the  first  food  he  eats;  and  so  they  consider  that  symbolically  by 
faith  they  have  eaten  their  saint,  and  they  believe  that  he  will  then 
guard  them  from  all  dangers.  What  think  you  Man!  of  your  species? 
Are  you  as  wise  as  you  set  yourself  up  to  be?  Are  acts  such  as  these 
things  that  men  should  do,  Justinus?  Quaderni  11  14  r.

and  'tu'  to  the  right  of  it  is  perhaps  connected  by  a  stroke  with  'idio'.  'Oratio'  may 
either  be  interpreted  as  meaning  'a  prayer'  or  it  may  be  a  reference  to  the  poet  Horace. 
The  latter  interpretation  receives  some  support  from  the  fact  of  the  similarity  of  thought

86  PHILOSOPHY 

JOHANNES  ANTONIUS  DI  JOHANNES  AMBROSIUS 
DE  BOLATE  x 

He  who  suffers  time  to  slip  away  and  does  not  grow  in  virtue  the 
more  one  thinks  about  him  the  sadder  one  becomes. 

No  man  has  a  capacity  for  virtue  who  sacrifices  honour  for  gain. 
Fortune  is  powerless  to  help  one  who  does  not  exert  himself.  That  man 
becomes  happy  who  follows  Christ. 

There  is  no  perfect  gift  without  great  suffering.  Our  triumphs  and 
our  pomps  pass  away;  gluttony  and  sloth  and  enervating  luxury  have 
banished  every  virtue  from  the  world;  so  that  as  it  were  wandering 
from  its  course  our  nature  is  subdued  by  habit.  Now  and  henceforth  it 
is  meet  that  you  cure  yourself  of  laziness.  The  Master  has  said  that 
sitting  on  down  or  lying  under  the  quilts  will  not  bring  thee  to  fame. 

He  who  without  it  has  frittered  life  away  leaves  no  more  trace  of 
himself  upon  the  earth  than  smoke  does  in  the  air  or  the  foam  on  the 
water.  Windsor:  Drawings  12349  v. 

Nothing  grows  in  a  spot  where  there  is  neither  sentient,  fibrous  nor 
rational  life.  The  feathers  grow  upon  birds  and  change  every  year; 
hair  grows  upon  animals  and  changes  every  year  except  a  part  such  as 
the  hair  of  the  beard  in  lions  and  cats  and  creatures  like  these.  The 
grass  grows  in  the  fields,  the  leaves  upon  the  trees,  and  every  year  these 
are  renewed  in  great  part.  So  then  we  may  say  that  the  earth  has  a 
spirit  of  growth,  and  that  its  flesh  is  the  soil;  its  bones  are  the  suc- 
cessive strata  of  the  rocks  which  form  the  mountains;  its  cartilage  is 
the  tufa  stone;  its  blood  the  springs  of  its  waters.  The  lake  of  blood 
that  lies  about  the  heart  is  the  ocean.  Its  breathing  is  by  the  increase 
and  decrease  of  the  blood  in  its  pulses,  and  even  so  in  the  earth  is  the 
ebb  and  flow  of  the  sea.  And  the  vital  heat  of  the  world  is  fire  which 
is  spread  throughout  the  earth;  and  the  dwelling  place  of  its  creative 
spirit  is  in  the  fires,  which  in  divers  parts  of  the  earth  are  breathed  out 
in  baths  and  sulphur  mines,  and  in  volcanoes,  such  as  Mount  Etna  in 
Sicily,  and  in  many  other  places.  Leic.  34  r. 

1  The  sentence  that  commences  'The  Master  has  said'  seems  to  suggest  that  these  are 
notes   of  Leonardo's   precepts   by   a   pupil,   who   apparently   began   by   writing   his   own 


PHILOSOPHY  87 

Falsehood  is  so  utterly  vile  that  though  it  should  praise  the  great 
works  of  God  it  offends  against  His  divinity.  Truth  is  of  such  excel- 
lence that  if  it  praise  the  meanest  things  they  become  ennobled. 

Without  doubt  truth  stands  to  falsehood  in  the  relation  of  light  to 
darkness,  and  truth  is  in  itself  of  such  excellence  that  even  when  it 
treats  of  humble  and  lowly  matters  it  yet  immeasurably  outweighs  the 
sophistries  and  falsehoods  which  are  spread  out  over  great  and  high- 
sounding  discourses;  for  though  we  have  set  up  falsehood  as  a  fifth  ele- 
ment in  our  mental  state  it  yet  remains  that  the  truth  of  things  is  the 
chief  food  of  all  finer  intellects — though  not  indeed  of  wandering  wits. 

But  you  who  live  in  dreams,  the  specious  reasonings,  the  feints 
which  palla  players  might  use,  if  only  they  treat  of  things  vast  and  un- 
certain, please  you  more  than  do  the  things  which  are  sure  and 
natural  and  of  no  such  high  pretension.  Sul  Volo  12  [n  J  r.

In  the  former  edition  of  Leonardo's  Notebooks  I  translated  this  sentence  as  'in  life 
beauty  perishes,  not  in  art',  having  in  my  reading  of  the  text  followed  Dr.  Richter  in 
supposing  the  last  word  to  be  'dart'  for  'd'arte'.  A  further  examination  of  a  photograph 
of  the  page  kindly  supplied  to  me  by  Sir  Eric  Maclagan  has  convinced  me  of  my  error. 

It  is  in  the  erroneous  form  cosa  bella  mortal  passa  e  non  d'arte  which  originated 
merely  in  an  error  of  transcription  that  the  sentence  occurs  on  the  title-page  of

[Precepts  for  the  study  of  the  foot] 

You  will  make  these  two  feet  with  the  same  contours  turned  in  the 
same  direction,  and  do  not  pay  any  regard  to  the  fact  that  they  remain 
the  one  right  and  the  other  left,  because  by  making  them  so  they  will 
be  easier  to  understand. 

First  you  will  make  all  these  bones  separated  the  one  from  the  other, 
arranged  in  such  a  way  that  each  part  of  each  bone  may  be  seen,  or 
may  be  turned  towards  the  side  of  that  bone  from  which  it  is  separated, 
and  to  which  it  should  be  reunited  when  you  join  up  all  the  bones  of 
these  feet  together  in  their  first  state. 

And  this  demonstration  is  made  in  order  to  be  better  able  to  recog- 
nise the  true  shape  of  each  bone  in  itself;  and  you  will  do  the  same  with 
each  demonstration  of  each  limb  in  whatever  direction  it  may  be 
turned.  Fogli  Air.

You  will  first  have  these  bones  sawn  lengthwise  and  then  across,  so

whole  and  disjoined,  as  here  above,  but  from  four  aspects  in  order  that 
one  can  understand  their  true  shape;  then  proceed  to  clothe  them  by 
degrees  with  their  nerves,  veins  and  muscles. 

[Method  for  the  study  of  the  parts  of  the  human  body]

notion  of  the  true  shape  of  any  limb  of  man  who  ranks  among  the 
animals  as  first  of  the  beasts  I  will  observe  the  aforesaid  rule,  making 
four  demonstrations  for  the  four  sides  of  each  limb,  and  for  the  bones  I 
will  make  five,  cutting  them  in  half  and  showing  the  hollow  of  each  of 
them,  one  being  full  of  marrow  the  other  spongy  or  empty  or  solid. 

[Of  the  bones  of  the  arm  ] 

The  arm,  which  has  the  two  bones  that  interpose  between  the  hand 
and  the  elbow,  will  be  somewhat  shorter  when  the  palm  of  the  hand  is 
turned  towards  the  ground  than  when  it  is  turned  towards  the  sky,  it 
the  man  is  standing  on  his  feet  with  his  arm  extended.  And  this  occurs 
because  these  two  bones,  in  turning  the  palm  of  the  hand  towards  the 
ground,  come  to  intersect  in  such  a  way  that  that  which  proceeds  from 
the  right  side  of  the  elbow  goes  towards  the  left  side  of  the  palm  of  the 
hand,  and  that  which  proceeds  from  the  left  side  of  the  elbow  ends  on 
the  right  side  of  the  palm  of  this  hand.

Rule  to  see  how  the  sound  of  the  voice  is  produced  in  the  front  of  the 
trachea.  This  will  be  understood  by  separating  this  trachea  together 
with  the  lung  of  the  man,  and  if  this  lung  be  filled  with  air  and  then 
closed  rapidly  one  will  be  able  immediately  to  see  in  what  way  the  pipe 
called  the  trachea  produces  this  sound;  and  this  can  be  perceived  and 
heard  well  in  the  neck  of  a  swan  or  a  goose  which  often  continues  to 
sing  after  it  is  dead. 

One  cannot  swallow  and  breathe  or  make  a  sound  at  the  same  time.

One  cannot  breathe  by  the  nose  and  by  the  mouth  at  the  same  time;

the  nose  and  another  with  the  mouth  at  the  same  time. 


WHY  THE  VOICE  GROWS  THIN  IN  THE  OLD

THE  NATURE  OF  THE  VEINS 

The  origin  of  the  sea  is  the  contrary  to  that  of  the  blood,  for  the  sea 
receives  within  itself  all  the  rivers,  which  are  entirely  caused  by  the 
aqueous  vapours  that  have  ascended  up  into  the  air;  while  the  sea  of 
the  blood  is  the  source  of  all  the  veins. 


OF  THE  NUMBER  OF  THE  VEINS 

The  vein  is  one  whole,  which  is  divided  into  as  many  main  branches 
as  there  are  principal  places  which  it  has  to  nourish,  and  these  branches 
are  subdivided  in  an  infinite  number. 

[Movements  of  the  nec1(\ 

The  neck  has  four  movements,  of  which  the  first  consists  of  raising 
the  second  of  lowering  the  face,  the  third  of  turning  right  or  left,  the 
fourth  of  bending  the  head  right  or  left.  [.  .  .]  are  mixed  movements, 
namely  raising  or  lowering  the  face  with  an  ear  near  to  a  shoulder,  and 
similarly  raising  or  lowering  the  face  after  turning  it  towards  one  of  the 
shoulders;  also  raising  or  lowering  the  face  after  turning  it  to  one  of 
the  shoulders  while  keeping  one  eye  lower  or  higher  than  the  other, 
and  this  is  called  separated  movement. 

And  to  these  movements  should  be  assigned  the  cords  and  muscles 
which  are  the  cause  of  these  movements,  and  consequently,  if  a  man 
should  be  found  lacking  in  power  to  make  one  of  these  movements  as  a

[The  true  conception  of  figures'] 

One  possesses  a  true  conception  of  all  figures  when  one  knows  their 
breadth,  length  and  depth;  if  therefore  I  observe  the  same  in  the  figure 
of  the  man  I  shall  give  a  true  conception  of  it  in  the  opinion  of  every- 
one of  sound  intelligence. 

Explain  these  words  for  they  are  confused.

Make  it  twice  as  much  larger  with  a  corresponding  thickness  of  ribs 
and  muscles,  and  it  will  be  easier  to  understand. 

Again  this  figure  would  be  confused  unless  you  first  of  all  made  at 
least  three  demonstrations  before  this  with  similar  threads;  demon- 
strations of  which  the  first  should  be  merely  of  the  bones,  then  follow 
with  the  muscles  which  start  in  the  breast  above  the  ribs,  and  finally  the 
muscles  that  start  from  the  thorax  together  with  the  ribs  and  last  of  all 
that  above. 

Make  the  ribs  so  thin  that  in  the  final  demonstration  made  with  the 
threads  the  position  of  the  shoulder-blade  may  be  visible. 

[Precepts  for  the  study  of  the  muscles] 

Before  you  represent  the  muscles  make,  in  place  of  these,  threads 
which  may  serve  to  show  the  positions  of  these  muscles,  which  should 
abut  with  their  extremities  in  the  centre  of  the  attachment  of  the 
muscles  above  their  bones.  And  this  will  supply  a  speedier  conception 
when  you  wish  to  represent  all  the  muscles  one  above  the  other.  And  if 
you  make  it  in  any  other  way  your  representation  will  be  confused.

The  vertebrae  of  the  neck  are  seven  of  which  the  first  above  and  the 
second  differ  from  the  other  five. 

You  should  make  these  bones  of  the  neck  from  three  aspects  united

two  other  aspects,  namely  seen  from  below  and  from  above,  and  in  this

REPRESENTATION  OF  THE  HAND 

The  first  demonstration  of  the  hand  will  be  made  of  the  bones  alone. 
The  second  of  the  ligaments  and  various  chains  of  nerves  that  bind 
them  together.  The  third  will  be  of  the  muscles  which  spring  up  upon 
these  bones.  The  fourth  will  be  of  the  first  tendons  which  rest  upon 
these  muscles  and  go  to  supply  movement  to  the  tips  of  the  fingers. 
The  fifth  will  be  that  which  shows  the  second  set  of  tendons  which 
move  all  the  fingers  and  end  at  the  last  but  one  of  the  bones  of  the 
fingers.  The  sixth  will  be  that  which  will  show  the  nerves  that  impart 
sensation  to  the  fingers  of  the  hand.  The  seventh  will  be  that  which 
will  show  the  veins  and  arteries  that  nourish  and  invigorate  the  fingers. 
The  eighth  and  last  will  be  the  hand  clothed  with  skin,  and  this  will  be 
shown  for  an  old  man,  a  young  man  and  a  child,  and  for  each  there

of  each  of  its  parts.  Fogli  a  10  v.

Make  a  demonstration  of  this  foot  with  the  simple  bones;  then  leav-

the  nerves;  and  then  over  the  same  bones  make  one  of  tendons,  and

The  muscles  that  move  the  toes  at  their  points,  both  below  and

and  those  that  move  the  whole  toe  upwards  and  downwards  appear  on 
the  upper  and  lower  side  of  the  foot;  and  as  the  hand  works  with  its 
arm  so  does  the  foot  with  the  leg.  Fogli  a  ii  r. 

[Precepts  for  the  study  of  the  foot] 

Make  a  demonstration  of  these  feet  without  the  membrane  that 
clothes  the  bones,  which  membrane  takes  possession  of  these  bones,  in- 
terposing itself  between  these  bones  and  the  muscles  and  tendons  that 
move  them;  and  by  this  way  you  will  be  able  to  show  under  which 
tendons,  nerves,  veins  or  muscle  are  the  joints  of  the  bones. 

[Representation  of  the  limbs  in  action] 
After  the  demonstration  of  all  the  parts  of  the  limbs  of  man  and  of 


ANATOMY  99 

the  other  animals  you  will  represent  the  proper  method  of  action  of 
these  limbs,  that  is  in  rising  alter  lying  down,  in  moving,  running  and 
jumping  in  various  attitudes,  in  lifting  and  carrying  heavy  weights,  in 
throwing  things  to  a  distance  and  in  swimming,  and  in  every  act  you 
will  show  which  limbs  and  which  muscles  are  the  causes  of  the  said 
actions,  and  especially  in  the  play  of  the  arms. 

REASON  WHY  TWO  MUSCLES  ARE  JOINED  TOGETHER 

It  often  occurs  that  two  muscles  are  joined  together  although  they 
have  to  serve  two  limbs;  and  this  has  been  done  so  that  if  one  muscle 
were  incapacitated  by  some  injury  the  other  muscle  in  part  supplied 
the  place  of  that  which  was  lacking.  Fogli  a  n  v. 

[Precepts  for  the  study  of  the  bones  of  the  foot] 

You  will  represent  these  bones  of  the  feet  all  equally  spread  out,  in 
order  that  their  number  and  shape  may  be  distinctly  understood.  And 
this  difference  you  will  represent  from  four  aspects  in  order  that  the 
true  shape  of  these  bones  in  all  their  aspects  may  be  more  accurately 
known. 

Make  the  bones  of  the  foot  somewhat  separated  one  from  another  in 
such  a  way  that  one  may  readily  distinguish  one  from  another,  and 
this  will  be  the  means  of  imparting  the  knowledge  of  the  number  of 
the  bones  of  the  feet  and  of  their  shape. 

At  the  end  of  every  representation  of  the  feet  you  will  give  the 
measure  of  the  thickness  and  length  of  each  of  the  bones  and  its 
position. 

The  aspects  of  the  foot  are  six,  namely :  below,  above,  within,  outside, 
behind  and  before;  and  to  these  is  added  the  six  demonstrations  of  the 
separated  bones  between  them;  and  there  are  those  of  the  bones  sawn 
lengthwise  in  two  ways,  that  is,  sawn  through  the  side  and  straight

[Motor  muscles  of  hands  and  wings] 

No  movement  either  of  the  hand  or  the  fingers  is  produced  by  the 
muscles  above  the  elbow;  and  so  it  is  with  birds  and  it  is  for  this 
reason  that  they  are  so  powerful  because  all  the  muscles  which  lower 


ioo  ANATOMY 

the  wings  spring  from  the  breast  and  these  have  in  themselves  a  greater 
weight  than  that  of  all  the  rest  of  the  bird.  Fogli  a  12  v.

are  fixed,  and  which  are  those  that  are  attached  above  the  bone  called 
humerus,  and  which  are  attached  above  the  other  muscles. 

Make  for  each  bone  separated  by  itself  its  muscles,  that  is  the  muscles 
which  grow  upon  it. 

Show  all  the  causes  of  the  movement  of  the  skin,  flesh  and  muscles 
of  a  face,  and  whether  the  muscles  derive  their  movement  from  the

And  do  this  first  of  all  with  the  horse  which  has  big  muscles  and

[Arrangements  of  vessels  and  nerves  of  fingers] 

Have  you  seen  the  diligence  of  nature  in  having  situated  the  nerves, 
arteries  and  veins  not  in  the  centre  but  in  the  sides  of  the  fingers  so

fingers  ?

knowledge  of  the  thing  described.  It  is  necessary  therefore  for  you  to 
represent  and  describe. 

Should  the  actual  thing  being  in  relief  seem  to  you  to  be  more 
recognisable  than  what  is  here  drawn,  which  impression  springs  from 
the  fact  of  your  being  able  to  see  the  object  from  different  aspects,  you 
must  understand  that  in  this  representation  of  mine  the  same  result 
will  be  obtained  from  the  same  aspects;  and  therefore  no  part  of  these 
limbs  will  be  hidden  from  you.

Describe  each  muscle,  what  finger  it  serves  and  what  limb;  represent 
it  therefore  simply,  without  any  impediment  from  any  other  muscle

muscles,  so  that  one  may  see  how  the  muscles  are  embraced  by  these 
veins  and  nerves,  and  take  away  the  sides  in  order  that  one  may  see 
better  how  the  larger  muscle  is  joined  to  the  shoulder-blade.

As  in  this  representation  of  a  shoulder  made  here  in  charcoal. 

The  muscles  are  of  two  shapes  with  two  different  names,  of  which 
the  shorter  is  called  muscle  and  the  longer  is  called  lacert. 

NATURE  OF  MUSCLES 

The  tendons  of  the  muscles  are  of  greater  or  less  length  as  a  man's 
fleshy  excrescence  is  greater  or  less.  And  in  leanness  the  fleshy  ex- 
crescence always  recedes  towards  the  point  at  which  it  starts  from 


102  ANATOMY 

the  fleshy  part.  And  as  it  puts  on  fat  it  extends  towards  the  beginning 
-of  its  tendon. 


HOW  THE  MUSCLES  ARE  ATTACHED  TO  THE  JOINTS 
OF  THE  BONES 

The  end  of  each  muscle  becomes  transformed  into  tendon,  which 
binds  the  joint  of  the  bone,  to  which  this  muscle  is  attached. 


OF  THE  NUMBER  OF  THE  TENDONS  AND  OF  THE 
MUSCLES 

The  number  of  the  tendons  which  successively  one  above  the  other 
cover  each  other  and  all  together  cover  and  bind  the  joint  of  the  bones 
to  which  they  are  joined,  is  as  great  as  the  number  of  the  muscles 
which  meet  in  the  same  joint. 

If  the  junction  of  the  muscle  b  is  made  with  the  bone  of  the  thigh 
and  actually  with  the  muscle  a,  or  the  muscle  b  and  the  muscle  a  since 
they  are  joined  together,  they  unite  and  establish  themselves  upon  this 
bone  of  the  thigh.  And  this  third  manner  is  more  useful  for  the  bene- 
fit of  the  movement  of  this  thigh,  and  more  certain,  for  if  the  muscle 
a  were  cut  or  otherwise  injured  the  muscle  b  would  itself  move  the 
thigh,  which  it  could  not  do  if  it  were  separated  from  the  bone  be- 
tween b  a.  Fogli  a  15  r. 

[Action  of  muscles  in  breathing] 

These  muscles  have  a  voluntary  and  an  involuntary  movement 
seeing  that  they  are  those  which  open  and  shut  the  lung.  When  they 
open  they  suspend  their  function  which  is  to  contract,  for  the  ribs 
which  at  first  were  drawn  up  and  compressed  by  the  contracting  of 
these  muscles  then  remain  at  liberty  and  resume  their  natural  distance 
as  the  breast  expands.  And  since  there  is  no  vacuum  in  nature  the 
lung  which  touches  the  ribs  from  within  must  necessarily  follow  their 
expansion;  and  the  lung  therefore  opening  like  a  pair  of  bellows 
draws  in  the  air  in  order  to  fill  the  space  so  formed.       Fogli  a  15  v.

[Function  of  muscles  in  breathing] 

TREATS  OF  MAN  ACCORDING  TO  THE  INSTRUMENTAL 
METHOD  AND  THE  CONTRARY 

With  the  muscles  it  happens  almost  universally  that  they  do  not 
move  the  limb  where  they  are  fixed  but  move  that  where  the  tendon 
that  starts  from  the  muscle  is  joined,  except  that  which  raises  and 
moves  the  side  in  order  to  help  respiration. 

All  these  muscles  serve  to  raise  the  ribs  and  as  they  raise  the  ribs 
they  dilate  the  chest,  and  as  the  chest  becomes  dilated  the  lung  is  ex- 
panded, and  the  expansion  of  the  lung  is  the  indrawing  of  the  air 
which  enters  by  the  mouth  into  this  lung  as  it  enlarges. 

OF  THE  DEMONSTRATION  OF  HOW  THE  SPINE  IS 
FIXED  IN  THE  NECK  • 

In  this  demonstration  of  the  neck  one  will  make  as  many  shapes  of 
muscles  and  tendons  as  are  the  uses  of  the  movements  of  the  neck. 
And  the  first  as  is  here  noted  is  how  the  ribs  in  their  strength  keep  the 
spine  of  the  neck  straight,  and  by  means  of  the  tendons  which  go  up 
to  this  spine  these  tendons  serve  a  double  use,  that  is  they  support  the 
spine  by  means  of  the  ribs  and  support  the  ribs  by  means  of  the  spine. 

And  this  duplication  of  powers  situated  at  the  opposite  extremities 
of  this  tendon  works  with  this  tendon  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
tendon  works  with  the  extremities  of  the  arch. 

But  this  convergence  of  muscles  in  the  spine  keeps  it  upright,  just 
as  the  ropes  of  the  ship  support  its  mast;  and  the  same  ropes  bound  to 
the  mast  also  support  in  part  the  edges  of  the  ships  to  which  they  are 
Joined.

OF  THE  METHOD  OF  REPRESENTING  THE  CAUSES  OF 
THE  MOVEMENTS  OF  ANY  LIMB 

Make  first  the  motor  muscles  of  the  bone  called  ?he  humerus;  then 
make  in  the  humerus  the  motor  muscles  of  the  arm  which  cause  it  to 
straighten  or  bend;  then  show  separately  the  muscles  that  have  their 
origin  in  this  humerus,  which  only  serve  to  turn  back  the  arm  when  it 
turns  the  hand  upside  down;  then  represent  in  the  arm  only  the  mus- 
cles which  move  the  hand  up  and  down  and  from  side  to  side  without 
moving  the  fingers  in  it;  then  represent  the  muscles  which  merely 
move  the  fingers,  locking  them  together  or  extending  them  or  spread- 
ing them  out  or  bringing  them  together;  but  first  represent  the  whole 
as  is  done  in  the  cosmography,  and  then  divide  it  into  the  aforesaid 
parts,  and  do  the  same  for  the  thigh,  the  leg  and  the  feet. 

OF  THE  MUSCLES  THAT  START  IN  THE  RIBS 
REPRESENTED  ABOVE 

I  have  for  a  long  time  and  not  without  reason  doubted  whether  the 
muscles  which  start  beneath  the  shoulder-blades  above  the  third,  fourth 
and  fifth  right  rib,  and  the  same  also  on  the  left  side,  are  made  for  the 
purpose  of  keeping  straight  the  spinal  column  of  the  neck  to  which 
they  attach  themselves  with  their  tendons,  or  whether  in  fact  these 
muscles,  as  they  contract,  draw  themselves  together  with  the  ribs  to- 
wards the  nape  of  the  neck,  by  means  of  the  aforesaid  tendons  attached 
to  the  spinal  column;  and  reason  moves  me  to  believe  that  these  mus- 
cles are  intended  to  support  the  spinal  column,  so  that  it  may  not  bend 
in  having  to  support  the  heavy  head  of  the  man,  as  it  bends  down  or  is 
raised,  for  the  help  of  which  the  muscles  of  the  shoulders  or  of  the  pit 
of  the  throat  do  not  serve,  seeing  that  the  man  will  relax  these  which 
start  in  the  shoulders  or  the  pit  of  the  throat  when  he  raises  his  shoul- 
ders towards  his  ears,  and  will  so  take  away  force  from  his  muscles; 
and  by  this  loosening  and  contracting  the  movement  of  the  neck  will 
not  be  impeded,  nor  will  the  resistance  of  the  spinal  column  in  support- 
ing this  head.  And  I  am  further  confirmed  in  this  same  opinion  by  the 
powerful  shape  of  the  ribs  where  these  muscles  are  situated,  which  is 
extremely  adapted  to  resist  every  weight  or  force  which  would  draw 


ANATOMY  105 

the  tendon  a  b  in  the  contrary  direction,  which  drawing  it  against  the 
rib  b  r  fixes  it  in  greater  power  in  the  position  r.  And  if  this  tendon 
had  to  raise  the  rib  in  order  to  facilitate  and  increase  the  breathing, 
nature  would  have  placed  this  cord  not  in  the  slant  a  b,  but  in  the 
greater  slant  a  c.  And  read  the  propositions  set  forth  below  and  in  the

this  arm  away  from  the  elbow.  And  do  the  same  in  the  demonstration 
of  the  foot. 

All  the  muscles  that  start  at  the  shoulders,  the  shoulder-blade  and  the 
chest,  serve  for  the  movement  of  the  arm  from  the  shoulder  to  the 
elbow.  And  all  the  muscles  that  start  between  the  shoulder  and  the 
elbow,  serve  for  the  movement  of  the  arm  between  the  elbow  and  the 
hand.  And  all  the  muscles  that  start  between  the  elbow  and  the  hand, 
serve  for  the  movement  of  the  hand.  And  all  the  muscles  that  start  in

When  you  represent  the  muscles  of  the  thigh,  represent  with  these 
the  bone  of  the  leg,  so  that  one  may  know  where  these  muscles  attach 
themselves  to  these  bones  of  the  legs. 

You  will  then  make  the  leg  with  its  muscles  attached  to  the  bones  of 
the  leg,  and  make  the  bones  bare.  And  you  will  follow  the  same  plan 
for  all  the  sinews. 

The  muscles  of  the  feet  serve  for  the  movement  of  its  toes,  and  in 
this  movement  they  are  aided  by  the  tendons  which  spring  from  the 
muscles  of  the  leg. 

Which  are  the  muscles  of  the  leg  which  serve  merely  for  the  simple 
movement  of  the  foot,  and  which  are  those  of  this  leg  that  serve  merely 
for  the  simple  movement  of  the  toes  of  this  foot?  And  remember,  in 
clothing  the  bones  of  the  leg  with  its  muscles  to  represent  first  the 
muscles  that  move  the  feet,  which  you  will  join  to  the  feet. 

Represent  here  the  foot  of  the  bear,  the  monkey  and  other  animals, 
in  so  far  as  they  differ  from  the  foot  of  man;  and  put  also  the  feet  of 
some  of  the  birds. 

The  muscles  of  the  leg  from  the  knee  to  the  joint  of  the  foot  are  as 


io6  ANATOMY 

many  in  number  as  the  tendons  attaching  to  the  upper  part  of  the  toes 
of  the  feet;  and  it  is  the  same  below,  adding  to  them  those  which  move 
the  feet  upwards  and  downwards  and  to  and  fro,  and  of  these  those 
which  raise  the  toes  are  five.  And  there  are  as  many  muscles  of  the  feet 
above  and  below  as  the  number  of  the  fingers  doubled.  But  as  I  have 
not  yet  finished  this  discourse  I  will  leave  it  for  the  present,  and  this 
winter  of  the  year  1510  I  look  to  finish  all  this  anatomy. 

The  tendons  that  lower  the  toes  of  the  feet  start  from  the  muscles 

which  have  their  beginning  in  the  sole  of  this  foot;  but  the  tendons  that 

raise  these  toes  do  not  have  their  beginning  in  the  outer  part  of  the 

thigh  as  some  have  written,  but  they  start  in  the  upper  part  of  the  foot 

called  the  instep.  And  if  you  desire  to  make  certain  of  this,  clasp  the 

thigh  with  your  hands  a  little  above  the  knee  and  raise  the  toes  of  the 

feet,  and  you  will  perceive  that  the  flesh  of  your  thigh  will  not  have 

any  movement  in  it  in  its  tendons  or  muscles;  so  it  is  quite  true.

[Precepts  for  the  study  of  the  foot\ 

Use  the  same  rule  for  the  foot  that  you  have  used  for  the  hand;  that 

is  representing  first  the  bones  from  six  aspects,  namely:  behind,  in 

front,  below  and  above,  on  the  inside  and  on  the  outside. 

[Considerations  upon  the  origin  of  the  muscles  of  the  foot] 

Mondinus  says  that  the  muscles  which  raise  the  toes  of  the  feet  are 
to  be  found  in  the  outer  part  of  the  thigh;  and  then  adds  that  the  back 
of  the  foot  has  no  muscles  because  nature  has  wished  to  make  it  light 
so  that  it  should  be  easy  in  movement,  as  if  it  had  a  good  deal  of  flesh 
it  would  be  heavier;  and  here  experience  shows  that  the  muscles  abed 
move  the  second  pieces  of  the  bones  of  the  toes;  and  that  the  muscles 
of  the  leg  r  S  t  move  the  points  of  the  toes.  Here  then  it  is  necessary  to 
enquire  why  necessity  has  not  made  them  all  start  in  the  foot  or  all  in 
the  leg;  or  why  those  of  the  leg  which  move  the  points  of  the  toes 
should  not  start  in  the  foot  instead  of  having  to  make  a  long  journey 
in  order  to  reach  these  points  of  the  toes;  and  similarly  those  that  move 
the  second  joints  of  the  toes  should  start  in  the  leg. 

[Precepts] 

Set  down  first  the  two  bones  of  the  leg  from  the  knee  to  the  foot, 
then  show  the  first  muscles  that  start  upon  the  said  bones,  and  pro- 


ANATOMY  107 

ceeding  thus  you  will  make  one  above  the  other  in  as  many  different 
demonstrations  as  are  the  stages  in  their  positions,  one  above  the  other; 
and  you  will  do  it  thus  as  far  as  the  end  of  one  side,  and  you  will  do 
the  same  for  four  sides  in  their  entirety  with  all  the  foot,  because  the 
foot  moves  by  means  of  tendons  which  start  in  these  muscles  of  the  leg; 
but  the  side  where  is  the  sole  is  moved  with  muscles  that  start  in  this 
sole;  and  the  membranes  of  the  joints  of  the  bones  start  from  the  mus- 
cles of  the  thigh  and  of  the  leg. 

After  you  have  made  the  demonstration  of  the  bone,  show  next  how 
it  is  clothed  by  those  membranes  which  are  interposed  between  the 
tendons  and  these  bones. 

Remember,  in  order  to  make  certain  as  to  the  origin  of  each  muscle, 
to  pull  out  the  tendon  produced  by  this  muscle  in  such  a  way  as  to  see 
this  muscle  move  and  its  commencement  upon  the  ligaments  of  the 
bones. 

Avicfenna].  The  muscles  that  move  the  toes  of  the  feet  are  sixty. 

[By  way  of  note] 

You  will  make  nothing  but  confusion  in  your  demonstration  of  the 
muscles  and  their  positions,  beginnings  and  ends,  unless  first  you  make 
a  demonstration  of  the  fine  muscles  by  means  of  threads;  and  in  this 
way  you  will  be  able  to  represent  them  one  above  another  as  nature 
has  placed  them;  and  so  you  will  be  able  to  name  them  according  to 
the  member  that  they  serve,  that  is,  the  mover  of  the  point  of  the  big 
toe,  and  of  the  middle  bone,  or  the  first  bone,  etc. 

And  after  you  have  given  these  details  you  will  show  at  the  side  the 
exact  shape  and  size  and  position  of  each  muscle;  but  remember  to 
make  the  threads  that  denote  the  muscles  in  the  same  positions  as  the 
central  lines  of  each  muscle,  and  in  this  way  these  threads  will  show 
the  shape  of  the  leg  and  their  distance  in  rapid  movement  and  in 
repose. 

[The  extensor  and  flexor  muscles  of  the  foot] 

The  muscles  which  are  only  used  to  move  the  foot  as  it  rises  forward 
are  m  n,  which  start  in  the  leg  from  the  knee  downwards;  and  those 
which  bend  it  towards  the  outside  of  the  ankle  are  the  muscles  /  n; 
therefore  n  is  common  to  both  these  movements.

[Atrophy  of  the  muscles] 

I  have  stripped  of  skin  one  who  by  an  illness  had  been  so  much 
wasted  that  the  muscles  were  worn  away  and  reduced  to  a  kind  of  thin 
pellicle,  in  such  a  way  that  the  tendons  instead  of  becoming  converted 
into  muscle  were  transformed  into  loose  skin;  and  when  the  bones  were 
clothed  with  skin  their  natural  size  was  but  slightly  increased. 

[Topography  of  the  muscles  and  motor  and  sensory  nerves  of  the  lower 

limb] 

You  will  show  first  the  bones  separated  and  somewhat  out  of  posi- 
tion, so  that  it  may  be  possible  to  distinguish  better  the  shape  of  each 
piece  of  bone  by  itself.  Afterwards  you  join  them  together  in  such 
a  way  that  they  do  not  diverge  from  the  first  demonstration,  except  in 
the  part  which  is  occupied  by  their  contact.  Having  done  this  you  will 
make  the  third  demonstration  of  those  muscles  that  bind  the  bones 
together.  Afterwards  you  will  make  the  fourth  of  the  nerves  which 
convey  sensation.  And  then  follows  the  fifth  of  the  nerves  that  move  or 
give  direction  to  the  first  joints  of  the  toes.  And  in  the  sixth  you  will 
make  the  muscles  above  the  feet  where  are  ranged  the  sensory  nerves. 
And  the  seventh  will  be  that  of  the  veins  which  feed  these  muscles  of 
the  foot.  The  eighth  will  be  that  of  the  nerves  that  move  the  points  of 
the  toes.  The  ninth  of  the  veins  and  arteries  that  are  interposed  between 
the  flesh  and  the  skin.  The  tenth  and  last  will  be  the  completed  foot 
with  all  its  powers  of  feeling.  You  will  be  able  to  make  the  eleventh  in 
the  form  of  a  transparent  foot,  in  which  one  is  able  to  see  all  the  afore- 
said things. 

[Precepts  for  the  study  of  the  leg] 

But  make  first  the  demonstration  of  the  sensory  nerves  of  the  leg, 
and  their  ramification,  from  four  aspects,  so  that  one  may  see  exactly 
from  whence  these  nerves  have  their  origin;  and  then  make  a  represen- 
tation of  a  foot  young  and  soft  with  few  muscles. 

All  the  nerves  of  the  legs  in  front  serve  the  points  of  the  toes,  as  is 
shown  with  the  great  toe. 

[By  way  of  note] 

After  making  your  demonstrations  of  the  bones  from  various  aspects 
then  make  the  membranes  which  are  interposed  between  the  bones  and 


ANATOMY  109 

the  muscles;  and  in  addition  to  this,  when  you  have  represented  the 
first  muscles,  and  have  described  and  shown  their  method  of  working, 
make  the  second  demonstration  upon  these  first  muscles,  and  the  third 
demonstration  upon  the  second,  and  so  in  succession. 

Make  here  first  the  simple  bones,  then  clothe  them  gradually  stage 
by  stage  in  the  same  way  that  nature  clothes  them. 

When  defining  the  foot  it  must  necessarily  be  joined  with  the  leg 
as  far  as  the  knee,  because  in  this  leg  start  the  muscles  which  move  the 
points  of  the  toes,  that  is  the  final  bones. 

In  the  first  demonstration  the  bones  should  be  somewhat  separated 
one  from  another,  in  order  that  their  true  shape  may  be  revealed.  In 
the  second  the  bones  should  be  shown  sawn  through,  in  order  that  it 
may  be  seen  what  part  is  hollow  and  what  part  solid.  In  the  third 
demonstration  these  bones  should  be  joined  together.  In  the  fourth 
should  be  the  ligaments  that  connect  one  of  these  bones  with  another. 
In  the  fifth  the  muscles  that  strengthen  these  bones.  Sixth  the  muscles 
should  be  shown  with  their  tendons.  Seventh  the  muscles  of  the  leg 
with  the  tendons  that  go  to  the  toes.  Eighth  the  nerves  of  sensation. 
Ninth  the  arteries  and  veins.  Tenth  the  muscular  skin.  Eleventh  the 
foot  in  its  final  beauty. 

And  each  of  the  four  aspects  should  have  these  eleven  demon- 
strations. Fogli  a  18  r.

HOW  THE  FIVE  SENSES  ARE  THE  MINISTERS  OF 
THE  SOUL 

The  soul  apparently  resides  in  the  seat  of  the  judgment,  and  the 
judgment  apparently  resides  in  the  place  where  all  the  senses  meet, 
which  is  called  the  common  sense;  and  it  is  not  all  of  it  in  the  whole 
body  as  many  have  believed,  but  it  is  all  in  this  part;  for  if  it  were 
all  in  the  whole,  and  all  in  every  part,  it  would  not  have  been  neces- 
sary for  the  instruments  of  the  senses  to  come  together  in  concourse 
to  one  particular  spot;  rather  would  it  have  sufficed  for  the  eye  to 
register  its  function  of  perception  on  its  surface,  and  not  to  transmit 
the  images  of  the  things  seen  to  the  sense  by  way  of  the  optic  nerves; 
because  the  soul — for  the  reason  already  given — would  comprehend 
them  upon  the  surface  of  the  eye. 

Similarly,  with  the  sense  of  hearing,  it  would  be  sufficient  merely 
for  the  voice  to  resound  in  the  arched  recesses  of  the  rock-like  bone 
which  is  within  the  ear,  without  there  being  another  passage  from  this 
bone  to  the  common  sense,  whereby  the  said  mouth  might  address 
itself  to  the  common  judgment. 

The  sense  of  smell  also  is  seen  to  be  forced  of  necessity  to  have  re- 
course to  this  same  judgment. 

The  touch  passes  through  the  perforated  tendons  and  is  transmitted 


ANATOMY  in 

to  this  sense;  these  tendons  proceed  to  spread  out  with  infinite  ramifica- 
tions into  the  skin  which  encloses  the  body's  members  and  the  bowels. 
The  perforating  tendons  carry  impulse  and  sensation  to  the  subject 
limbs;  these  tendons  passing  between  the  muscles  and  the  sinews 
dictate  to  these  their  movement,  and  these  obey,  and  in  the  act  of  obey- 
ing they  contract,  for  the  reason  that  the  swelling  reduces  their  length 
and  draws  with  it  the  nerves,  which  are  interwoven  amid  the  particles 
of  the  limbs,  and  being  spread  throughout  the  extremities  of  the  fingers, 
they  transmit  to  the  sense  the  impression  of  what  they  touch. 

The  nerves  with  their  muscles  serve  the  tendons  even  as  soldiers  serve 
their  leaders,  and  the  tendons  serve  the  common  sense  as  the  leaders 
their  captain,  and  this  common  sense  serves  the  soul  as  the  captain 
serves  his  lord. 

So  therefore  the  articulation  of  the  bones  obeys  the  nerve,  and  the 
nerve  the  muscle,  and  the  muscle  the  tendon,  and  the  tendon  the  com- 
mon sense,  and  the  common  sense  is  the  seat  of  the  soul,  and  the 
memory  is  its  monitor,  and  its  faculty  of  receiving  impressions  serves 
as  its  standard  of  reference. 

How  the  sense  waits  on  the  soul,  and  not  the  soul  on  the  sense,  and 
how  where  the  sense  that  should  minister  to  the  soul  is  lacking,  the 
soul  in  such  a  life  lacks  conception  of  the  function  of  this  sense,  as  is 
seen  in  the  case  of  a  mute  or  one  born  blind.  Fogli  b  2  r. 

How  the  nerves  sometimes  work  of  themselves,  without  the  com- 
mand of  other  agents  or  of  the  soul : 

This  appears  clearly  for  you  will  see  how  paralytics  or  those  who  are 
shivering  or  benumbed  by  cold  move  their  trembling  limbs  such  as  the 
head  or  the  hands  without  permission  of  the  soul;  which  soul  with  all 
its  powers  cannot  prevent  these  limbs  from  trembling.  The  same  hap- 
pens in  the  case  of  epilepsy  or  with  severed  limbs  such  as  the  tails  of 
lizards. 

FUNCTION  OF  LIVER,  BILE,  AND  INTESTINES 

The  liver  is  the  distributor  and  dispenser  of  vital  nourishment  to 
man. 
The  bile  is  the  familiar  or  servant  of  the  liver  which  sweeps  away 


ii2  ANATOMY 

and  cleans  up  all  the  dirt  and  superfluities  left  after  the  food  has  been 
distributed  to  the  members  by  the  liver. 

The  intestines.  As  to  these  you  will  understand  their  windings  well 
if  you  inflate  them.  And  remember  that  after  you  have  made  them 
from  four  aspects  thus  arranged  you  then  make  them  from  four  other 
aspects  expanded  in  such  a  way  that  from  their  spaces  and  openings 
you  can  understand  the  whole,  that  is,  the  variations  of  their  thick- 
nesses. Fogli  b  2  v. 

[Chyle.  Mesentery] 

By  the  ramification  of  the  vein  of  the  chyle  in  the  mesentery  nourish- 
ment is  drawn  from  the  corruption  of  the  food  in  the  intestines,  and  in 
the  last  instance  it  returns  by  the  final  ramifications  of  the  artery  to 
these  intestines  where  this  blood  being  afterwards  dead  it  is  corrupted 
and  acquires  the  same  stench  as  comes  from  the  faeces. 

The  mesentery  is  a  thick  sinewy  and  greasy  membrane  in  the  rami- 
fications of  which  are  twelve  chief  veins,  and  it  is  joined  to  the  lower 
part  of  the  diaphragm. 

See  whether  the  mesentery  has  arteries  or  no. 

In  this  mesentery  are  planted  the  roots  of  all  the  veins,  which  unite 
at  the  gate  of  the  liver  and  purify  the  blood  in  the  liver;  and  it  then 
enters  the  vein  of  the  chyle,  and  this  vein  goes  to  the  heart  and  makes 
purer  the  blood  which  penetrates  in  the  arteries  as  spirituous  blood. 

Fogli  b  3  r. 

OF  THE  FORCE  OF  THE  MUSCLES 

If  any  muscle  whatsoever  be  drawn  out  lengthwise  a  slight  force 
will  break  its  fleshy  tissue;  and  if  the  nerves  of  sensation  be  drawn  out 
lengthwise  slight  power  tears  them  from  the  muscles  where  their  rami- 
fication weaves  them  together  and  spreads  and  consumes  itself;  and 
one  sees  the  same  process  enacted  with  the  sinewy  covering  of  the  veins 
and  arteries  which  are  mingled  with  these  muscles.  What  is  therefore 
the  cause  of  so  great  a  force  of  arms  and  legs  which  is  seen  in  the  ac- 
tions of  any  animal  whatsoever?  One  cannot  say  other  than  that  it  is 
the  skin  which  clothes  them;  and  that  when  the  nerves  of  sensation 
thicken  the  muscles  these  muscles  contract  and  draw  after  them  the 
tendons  in  which  their  extremities  become  converted;  and  in  this  proc- 


ANATOMY  113 

ess  of  thickening  they  fill  out  the  skin  and  make  it  drawn  and  hard; 
and  it  cannot  be  lengthened  out  unless  the  muscles  become  thinner; 
and  not  becoming  thinner  they  are  a  cause  of  resistance  and  of  making 
strong  the  before  mentioned  skin,  in  which  the  swollen  muscles  per- 
form the  function  of  a  wedge. 

[Precepts  for  demonstrations]  [With  drawing] 

Only  represent  in  this  demonstration  the  first  upper  rib,  for  this  of

[Of  the  nec\] 

You  will  use  extreme  diligence  in  making  this  demonstration  of  the 
neck  inside,  outside  and  in  profile,  and  the  proportions  of  the  tendons 
and  of  the  nerves  between  them,  and  with  the  positions  where  they 
begin  and  end;  for  if  you  were  to  do  otherwise  you  would  neither  be 
able  to  treat  of  nor  demonstrate  the  office  or  use  for  which  nature  or 
necessity  has  intended  them.  And  in  addition  to  this  you  should  de- 
scribe the  distances  interposed  between  the  nerves  themselves  both 
as  regards  their  depth  and  breadth,  and  the  differences  in  the  heights 
and  depths  of  their  origins;  and  you  will  do  the  like  with  the  muscles

tortoises,  green  lizards,  chameleons  and  the  like. 

I  believe  that  these  four  nerves  are  those  of  the  reins  or  arteries. 

I  have  found  that  they  are  of  the  greater  veins  of  the  reins.

[Reason  for  position  of  veins  in  \nee\ 

Nature  has  placed  the  principal  veins  of  the  leg  in  the  middle  of  the 
thickness  of  the  knee  joint,  because  in  the  process  of  bending  this  joint 
the  veins  are  less  compressed  than  if  they  were  situated  in  front  of  or 
behind  the  knee. 

[Relation  of  nerves  with  muscles] 

There  are  as  many  ramifications  of  the  nerves  as  there  are  muscles, 
and  there  cannot  be  either  more  or  less,  because  these  muscles  can  only 
be  contracted  or  distended  by  reason  of  these  nerves  from  which  the 
muscles  receive  their  sensation.  And  there  are  as  many  tendons  that 
move  the  limbs  as  there  are  muscles.  Fogli  b  5  r.

ANATOMY  115 

Draw  the  arm  of  Francesco  the  miniaturist  which  shows  many  veins. 

[Precepts  for  anatomical  drawings  and  demonstrations} 

In  demonstrations  of  this  kind  you  should  show  the  exact  contours 
of  the  limbs  by  a  single  line;  and  in  the  centre  place  their  bones  with 
the  true  distances  from  their  skin,  that  is  the  skin  of  the  arm;  and  then 
you  will  make  the  veins  which  may  be  whole  upon  a  clear  ground;  and 
thus  there  will  be  given  a  clear  conception  as  to  the  position  of  the 
bone,  vein  and  nerves. 

[Changes  of  the  arteries  in  age} 

In  proportion  as  the  veins  become  old  they  lose  their  straightness  of 
direction  in  their  ramifications,  and  become  so  much  the  more  flexible 
or  winding  and  of  thicker  covering  as  old  age  becomes  more  full  with 
years. 

You  will  find  almost  universally  that  the  passage  of  the  veins  and  the 
passage  of  the  nerves  are  on  the  same  path,  and  direct  themselves  to 
the  same  muscles  and  ramify  in  the  same  manner  in  each  of  these 
muscles,  and  that  each  vein  and  nerve  pass  with  the  artery  between  one 
muscle  and  the  other,  and  ramify  in  these  with  equal  ramification. 

[Expansibility  of  the  vessels} 

The  veins  are  extensible  and  expansible;  and  of  this  there  is  testi- 
mony afforded  in  the  fact  that  I  have  seen  one  who  has  chanced  to 
wound  the  common  vein  and  has  immediately  bound  it  up  again  with 
a  tight  bandage  and  in  the  space  of  a  few  days  there  has  grown  a  blood- 
coloured  tumour  as  large  as  a  goose's  egg,  full  of  blood,  and  it  has 
remained  so  for  several  years;  and  I  have  also  found  in  the  case  of  a 
decrepit  man  that  the  mesaraic  veins  have  contracted  the  passage  of 
the  blood  and  doubled  in  length.  Fogli  b  10  r. 

[Changes  of  the  arteries,  hepatic  veins,  and  abdominal  organs  in  the 

old] 

The  artery  and  the  vein  which  in  the  old  extend  between  the  spleen 
and  the  liver,  acquire  so  great  a  thickness  of  skin  that  it  contracts  the 
passage  of  the  blood  that  comes  from  the  mesaraic  veins,  through 
which  this  blood  passes  over  to  the  liver  and  the  heart  and  the  two 
greater  veins,  and  as  a  consequence  through  the  whole  body;  and  apart 
from  the  thickening  of  the  skin  these  veins  grow  in  length  and  twist 


n6  ANATOMY 

themselves  after  the  manner  of  a  snake,  and  the  liver  loses  the  humour 
of  the  blood  which  was  carried  there  by  this  vein;  and  consequently 
this  liver  becomes  dried  up  and  grows  like  frozen  bran  both  in  colour 
and  substance,  so  that  when  it  is  subjected  even  to  the  slightest  friction 
this  substance  falls  away  in  tiny  flakes  like  sawdust  and  leaves  the  veins 
and  arteries. 

And  the  veins  of  the  gall  and  of  the  navel  which  entered  into  this 
liver  by  the  gate  of  the  liver  all  remain  deprived  of  the  substance  of  this 
liver,  after  the  manner  of  maize  or  Indian  millet  when  their  grains 
have  been  separated. 

The  colon  and  the  other  intestines  in  the  old  become  much  con- 
stricted, and  I  have  found  there  stones  in  the  veins  which  pass  beneath 
the  fork  of  the  breast,  which  were  as  large  as  chestnuts,  of  the  colour 
and  shape  of  truffles  or  of  dross  or  clinkers  of  iron,  which  stones  were 
extremely  hard,  as  are  these  clinkers,  and  had  formed  bags  which  were 
hanging  to  the  said  veins  after  the  manner  of  goitres. 

And  this  old  man,  a  few  hours  before  his  death,  told  me  that  he  had 
lived  a  hundred  years,  and  that  he  did  not  feel  any  bodily  ailment 
other  than  weakness,  and  thus  while  sitting  upon  a  bed  in  the  hospital 
of  Santa  Maria  Nuova  at  Florence,  without  any  movement  or  sign  of 
anything  amiss,  he  passed  away  from  this  life. 

And  I  made  an  autopsy  in  order  to  ascertain  the  cause  of  so  peaceful 
a  death,  and  found  that  it  proceeded  from  weakness  through  failure 
of  blood  and  of  the  artery  that  feeds  the  heart  and  the  other  lower 
members,  which  I  found  to  be  very  parched  and  shrunk  and  withered; 
and  the  result  of  this  autopsy  I  wrote  down  very  carefully  and  with 
great  ease,  for  the  body  was  devoid  of  either  fat  or  moisture,  and  these 
form  the  chief  hindrance  to  the  knowledge  of  its  parts. 

The  other  autopsy  was  on  a  child  of  two  years,  and  here  I  found 
everything  the  contrary  to  what  it  was  in  the  case  of  the  old  man. 

The  old  who  enjoy  good  health  die  through  lack  of  sustenance. 
And  this  is  brought  about  by  the  passage  to  the  mesaraic  veins  becom- 
ing continually  restricted  by  the  thickening  of  the  skin  of  these  veins; 
and  the  process  continues  until  it  affects  the  capillary  veins,  which  are 
the  first  to  close  up  altogether;  and  from  this  it  comes  to  pass  that  the 
old  dread  the  cold  more  than  the  young,  and  that  those  who  are  very 


ANATOMY  117 

old  have  their  skin  the  colour  of  wood  or  of  dried  chestnut,  because 
this  skin  is  almost  completely  deprived  of  sustenance. 

And  this  network  of  veins  acts  in  man  as  in  oranges,  in  which  the 
peel  becomes  thicker  and  the  pulp  diminishes  the  more  they  become 
old.  And  if  you  say  that  as  the  blood  becomes  thicker  it  ceases  to  flow 
through  the  veins,  this  is  not  true,  for  the  blood  in  the  veins  does  not 
thicken  because  it  continually  dies  and  is  renewed,         Fogli  b  10  v. 

[Principal  vessels  of  the  thorax] 

You  will  make  the  veins  which  are  in  the  heart  and  also  the  arteries 
which  give  it  life  and  nourishment. 

[Heart  and  vessels] 

The  heart  is  the  nut  which  produces  the  tree  of  the  veins;  which 
veins  have  their  roots  in  the  dung,  that  is  the  mesaraic  veins  which 
proceed  to  deposit  the  blood  they  have  acquired  in  the  liver  from 
which  afterwards  the  upper  veins  of  the  liver  are  nourished. 

[Precepts  for  anatomical  drawings] 

Make  first  the  ramification  of  the  veins  by  themselves,  then  the  bones 
by  themselves,  and  then  join  the  bones  and  veins  together. 

[Heart  and  vessels  proceeding  from  the  heart,  and  comparison  with  the 

roots  and  ramifications  of  plants] 

The  plant  never  springs  from  the  ramification  for  at  first  the  plant 
exists  before  this  ramification,  and  the  heart  exists  before  the  veins. 

All  the  veins  and  arteries  proceed  from  the  heart;  and  the  reason  is 
that  the  maximum  thickness  that  is  found  in  these  veins  and  arteries  is 
at  the  junction  that  they  make  with  the  heart;  and  the  farther  away 
they  are  from  the  heart  the  thinner  they  become  and  they  are  divided 
into  more  minute  ramifications.  And  if  you  should  say  that  the  veins 
start  in  the  protuberance  of  the  liver  because  they  have  their  ramifica- 
tions in  this  protuberance,  just  as  the  roots  of  plants  have  in  the  earth, 
the  reply  to  this  comparison  is  that  plants  do  not  have  their  origin  in 
their  roots,  but  that  the  roots  and  the  other  ramifications  have  their 
origin  in  the  lower  part  of  these  plants,  which  is  between  the  air  and 
the  earth;  and  all  the  parts  of  the  plant  above  and  below  are  always 
less  than  this  part  which  borders  upon  the  earth;  therefore  it  is  evi- 
dent that  the  whole  plant  has  its  origin  from  this  thickness,  and,  in 


n8  ANATOMY 

consequence,  the  veins  have  their  origin  in  the  heart  where  is  their 
greatest  thickness;  never  can  any  plant  be  found  which  has  its  origin 
in  the  points  of  its  roots  or  other  ramifications;  and  the  example  of  this 
is  seen  in  the  growing  of  the  peach  which  proceeds  from  its  nut  as  is 
shown  above.  Fogli  but.

[Alterations  in  the  inner  coating  of  the  blood  vessels  in  the  old] 

One  asks  why  the  veins  in  the  old  acquire  great  length,  and  those 
which  used  to  be  straight  become  bent,  and  the  skin  thickens  so  much 
as  to  close  up  and  stop  the  movement  of  the  blood,  and  from  this 
arises  the  death  of  the  old  without  any  disease. 

I  consider  that  a  thing  which  is  nearer  to  that  which  feeds  it  in- 
creases more;  and  for  this  reason  these  veins  being  a  sheath  of  the  blood 
that  nourishes  the  body  it  nourishes  the  veins  so  much  the  more  as  they 
are  nearer  to  the  blood. 

[Arteries  of  the  abdomen.  Causes  of  death  in  the  old] 

The  veins  a  b  become  so  much  constricted  in  the  old  that  the  blood 
loses  its  power  of  movement  through  them,  and  so  usually  becomes 
foul,  and  can  no  longer  penetrate  the  new  blood  which  sweeps  it  away 
as  it  used  to  do  as  it  comes  from  the  gate  of  the  stomach,  whence  this 
good  blood  grows  corrupt  away  from  the  bowels,  and  so  the  old  fail 
without  fever  when  they  are  of  great  age. 
And  why  the  bowels  in  the  old  are  much  constricted. 

[Impossibility  of  the  removal  of  the  spleen  in  the  living] 

It  is  shown  here  that  it  is  impossible  to  remove  the  spleen  from  men 
as  is  believed  by  those  who  are  ignorant  of  its  constituent  substance, 
because  as  is  here  shown  it  cannot  be  extracted  from  bodies  without 
causing  death;  and  this  happens  because  of  the  veins  with  which  it 
nourishes  the  stomach. 

[Vessels  which  provide  for  the  nutrition  of  the  abdominal  organs] 

The  vein  which  extends  between  the  gate  of  the  liver  and  the  gate 
of  the  spleen  has  its  roots  with  five  ramifications  that  ramify  in  the  five 


ANATOMY  119 

coverings  of  the  liver,  and  at  the  middle  of  its  trunk  there  starts  a 
branch  which  spreads  out  in  nourishment  from  the  base  of  the  peri- 
toneum and  extends  in  all  its  parts.  And  a  little  farther  away  a  branch 
raises  itself  up  and  joins  itself  to  the  left  part  below  the  stomach,  and 
then  ends  somewhat  farther  on  in  two  branches  at  the  junction  with 
the  spleen,  and  goes  ramifying  through  all  its  substance. 

[Cause  of  death  in  the  old] 

Veins  which  by  the  thickening  of  their  tunicles  in  the  old  restrict 
the  passage  of  the  blood,  and  by  this  lack  of  nourishment  destroy  their 
life  without  any  fever,  the  old  coming  to  fail  little  by  little  in  slow 
death. 

And  this  happens  through  lack  of  exercise  since  the  blood  is  not 
warmed.  Fogli  b  11  v. 


OF  THE  REASON  OF  THE  HEAT  OF  THE  BLOOD 

The  heat  is  produced  by  the  movement  of  the  heart,  and  this  mani- 
fests itself  because  in  proportion  as  the  heart  moves  more  swiftly  the 
heat  increases  more,  as  is  shown  by  the  pulse  of  those  suffering  from 
fever  which  is  moved  by  the  beating  of  the  heart.

[Mechanism  of  action  of  the  heart] 

Heart  open  in  the  receptacle  of  the  spirits,  that  is  in  the  artery;  and 
in  m  it  takes  or  rather  gives  the  blood  to  the  artery,  and  by  the  mouth, 
b,  it  refreshes  itself  with  air  from  the  lung,  and  by  c  it  fills  the  auricles 
of  the  heart  s. 

n  Firm  muscle  is  drawn  back,  and  it  is  the  first  cause  of  the  move- 
ment of  the  heart,  and  as  it  draws  back  it  thickens,  and  as  it  thickens 
it  becomes  shortened  and  draws  back  with  it  all  the  lower  and  upper 
muscles,  and  closes  the  door  m,  and  shortens  the  space  that  intervenes 
between  the  base  and  the  apex  of  the  heart,  and  consequently  comes  to 
empty  it  and  to  draw  to  itself  the  fresh  air.  Fogli  b  12  r.

\F unction  of  the  lung  in  relation  to  the  circulation} 

Of  the  lung.  This  is  moved  by  others,  that  is,  by  the  first  mover 
which  is  the  heart  which  as  it  becomes  constricted  draws  the  veins  after 
it,  with  which  it  restores  the  heated  air  to  the  lung,  and  opens  it,  and 
this  lung  can  close  either  voluntarily  or  through  oblivion,  that  is,  for- 
getfulness  through  excess  of  thought;  and  by  this  means  the  heart 
draws  back  from  it  the  heated  air  which  it  has  given  it;  but  this  act 
cannot  be  repeated  many  times  for  if  it  were  not  for  its  refreshing  it- 
self with  new  air  it  would  come  to  suffocate. 

Testicles,  witnesses  of  coition.  These  contain  in  themselves  ardour 
that  is  they  are  augmenters  of  the  animosity  and  ferocity  of  the  ani- 
mals; and  experience  shows  us  this  clearly  in  the  castrated  animals,  of 
which  one  sees  the  bull,  the  boar,  the  ram  and  the  cock,  very  fierce  ani- 
mals, which  after  having  been  deprived  of  these  testicles  remain  very 
cowardly;  so  one  sees  a  ram  drive  before  it  a  herd  of  wethers,  and  a 
cock  put  to  flight  a  number  of  capons;  and  I  have  seen  the  same  thing 
happen  with  a  hen,  and  also  with  oxen. 

Delia  verga.  This  confers  with  the  human  intelligence  and  some- 
times has  intelligence  of  itself,  and  although  the  will  of  the  man  desires 
to  stimulate  it  it  remains  obstinate  and  takes  its  own  course,  and  mov- 
ing sometimes  of  itself  without  licence  or  thought  by  the  man,  whether 
he  be  sleeping  or  waking,  it  does  what  it  desires;  and  often  the  man  is 
asleep  and  it  is  awake,  and  many  times  the  man  is  awake  and  it  is 
asleep;  many  times  the  man  wishes  it  to  practise  and  it  does  not  wish 
it;  many  times  it  wishes  it  and  the  man  forbids  it.  It  seems  therefore 
that  this  creature  has  often  a  life  and  intelligence  separate  from  the 
man,  and  it  would  appear  that  the  man  is  in  the  wrong  in  being 
ashamed  to  give  it  a  name  or  to  exhibit  it,  seeking  the  rather  con- 
stantly to  cover  and  conceal  what  he  ought  to  adorn  and  display  with 
ceremony  as  a  ministrant.

In  fact  man  does  not  vary  from  the  animals  except  in  what  is  acci-

where  nature  finishes  producing  its  species  there  man  begins  with 
natural  things  to  make  with  the  aid  of  this  nature  an  infinite  number 
of  species;  and  as  these  are  not  necessary  to  those  who  govern  them- 
selves rightly  as  do  the  animals  it  is  not  in  their  disposition  to  seek

[Passage  of  the  urine  from  the  \idneys  into  the  bladder  by  means  of 

the  ureters] 

The  authorities  say  that  the  uretary  ducts  do  not  enter  directly  to 
carry  the  urine  to  the  bladder;  but  that  they  enter  between  skin  and 
skin  by  ways  that  do  not  meet  each  other;  and  that  the  more  the  blad- 
der becomes  filled  the  more  they  become  contracted;  and  this  they  say 
nature  has  done  merely  in  order  that  when  the  bladder  is  filled  it 
should  turn  the  urine  backwards  whence  it  came;  in  such  a  way  that  in 
finding  che  ways  between  membrane  and  membrane  to  penetrate  into 
the  interior  by  narrow  ways  and  not  opposite  to  that  of  the  first  mem- 
brane, the  more  the  bladder  is  filled,  the  more  it  presses  one  membrane 
against  the  other,  and  consequently  it  has  no  cause  to  spread  itself  out 
and  turn  back.  This  proof  however  does  not  hold,  seeing  that  if  the 
urine  were  to  rise  higher  in  the  bladder  than  its  entrance  which  is  near 
the  middle  of  its  height  it  would  follow  that  this  entrance  would  sud- 
denly close  and  no  more  urine  would  be  able  to  pass  into  the  bladder 
and  the  quantity  would  never  exceed  the  half  of  the  capacity  of  this 
bladder;  the  remainder  of  the  bladder  therefore  would  be  superfluous, 
and  nature  does  not  create  anything  superfluous.  We  may  say  there- 
fore, by  the  fifth  [section]  of  the  sixth  [book]  concerning  waters,  that 
the  urine  enters  the  bladder  by  a  long  and  winding  way,  and  when  the 
bladder  is  full  the  uretary  ducts  remain  full  of  urine,  and  the  urine 
that  is  in  the  bladder  cannot  rise  higher  than  their  surface  when  the 
man  is  upright;  but  if  he  remains  lying  down  it  can  turn  back  through 


122  ANATOMY 

these  ducts,  and  even  more  can  it  do  this  if  he  should  put  himself  up- 
side down  which  is  not  often  done;  but  the  recumbent  position  is  very 
usual,  in  which  if  a  man  lies  on  his  side  one  of  the  uretary  ducts  re- 
mains above  the  other  below;  and  that  above  opens  its  entrance  and 
discharges  the  urine  into  the  bladder,  and  the  other  duct  below  closes 
because  of  the  weight  of  the  urine;  consequently  a  single  duct  trans- 
mits the  urine  to  the  bladder,  and  it  is  sufficient  moreover  that  one  of 
the  emulgent  veins  purify  the  blood  of  the  chyle  of  the  urine  which  is 
mixed  with  it  because  these  emulgent  veins  are  opposite  to  one  another 
and  do  not  all  proceed  from  the  vein  of  the  chyle.  And  if  the  man  sets 
himself  with  his  back  to  the  sky  both  the  two  uretary  ducts  pour  urine 
into  the  bladder,  and  enter  through  the  upper  part  of  the  bladder,  be- 
cause these  ducts  are  joined  in  the  back  part  of  the  bladder,  and  this 
part  remains  above  when  the  body  is  facing  downwards,  and  conse- 
quently the  entrances  of  the  urine  are  able  to  stand  open,  and  to  supply 
so  much  urine  to  the  bladder  that  it  fills  it. 
When  the  man  is  upside  down  the  entrance  of  the  urine  is  closed.

[Reason  of  the  arrangement  of  the  human  intestine  in  relation  to  nu- 
trition ] 

Animals  without  legs  have  a  straight  bowel,  and  this  is  why  it  al- 
ways remains  lying  down,  for  the  animal  not  having  feet  cannot  raise 
itself  on  them,  and  if  it  should  raise  itself  it  returns  immediately  to  a 
level  position;  but  in  the  case  of  the  man  this  would  not  take  place  by 
reason  of  his  holding  himself  quite  straight,  because  the  stomach  would 
suddenly  empty  itself  if  the  twisted  nature  of  the  intestines  did  not 
check  the  descent  of  the  food;  and  if  the  bowel  were  straight  each  part 
of  the  food  would  not  come  in  contact  with  the  bowels  as  it  does  in 
the  twisted  bowels. 

And  consequently  there  would  remain  much  nutritive  substance  in 
the  superfluous  parts  of  this  food  which  would  not  be  able  to  be  sucked 
by  the  substance  of  these  bowels  and  transported  in  the  mesaraic  veins, 

[Defecation.  Intestinal  movements  in  relation  to  the  diaphragm] 

When  with  the  transversal  muscles  of  the  body  one  presses  out  the 
superfluous  parts  from  the  intestines,  these  muscles  would  not  perform 
their  function  well  or  powerfully  unless  the  lung  were  filled  with  air; 


ANATOMY  123 

seeing  that  if  this  lung  were  not  full  of  air  it  would  not  fill  with  itself 
all  the  diaphragm;  consequently  this  diaphragm  remains  loose,  and  the 
intestines  pressed  by  the  said  transversal  muscles  bend  towards  the  side 
that  gives  way  to  them,  which  would  be  the  diaphragm.  But  if  this 
lung  should  stay  full  of  air  and  you  do  not  afford  it  outlet  above,  then 
the  diaphragm  is  taut  and  firm  and  offers  resistance  to  the  rising  up  of 
the  intestines  when  pressed  by  the  transversal  muscles;  consequently  of 
necessity  the  intestines  rid  themselves  through  the  straight  intestine  of  a 
great  part  of  the  superfluity  which  is  enclosed  within  them.

covers  the  stomach  as  far  as  the  vein  which  enters  and  afterwards 
emerges  from  this  liver,  and  to  see  how  this  vein  ramifies  through  this 
liver.  But  first  I  will  have  represented  how  all  this  liver  stands  and  how 
it  clothes  the  stomach.  Fogli  b  14  v. 

All  the  muscles  of  the  body  are  enveloped  in  extremely  thin  cartilage, 
and  then  they  become  changed  to  thicker  cartilage  and  in  that  their 
substance  ends. 

[Action  of  the  transversal  muscles  of  the  abdomen  upon  defecation] 

The  transversal  muscles  squeeze  the  intestines  but  not  the  longi- 
tudinal ones,  because  if  it  were  so  when  the  man  holds  himself  bent 
and  relaxes  these  muscles  he  would  not  have  force  to  perform  the  of- 
fice of  squeezing  them;  but  the  transversal  muscles  never  relax  as  the 
man  bends  but  rather  become  stretched. 

[Muscles  of  the  anterior  wall  of  the  abdomen  and  their  function] 
[Drawing  n  r  b  a  s  h  m] 

a  b  are  final  longitudinal  muscles;  the  membranes  in  which  they  be- 
come transformed  pass  at  a  right  angle  below  the  longitudinal  a  m. 

The  muscles  n  r  s  h  are  four  and  have  five  tendons  and  were  not 
made  of  a  single  piece  as  the  others,  so  that  each  was  shorter;  although 
where  there  is  life  with  thickness  there  is  strength,  and  where  there 
is  such  great  length  of  movement  there  it  is  necessary  to  divide  the 
mover  into  several  parts,  and  its  greater  extension,  exceeds  its  lesser 
extension  by  the  third  part  of  ©ne  of  its  arms,  and  by  so  much  more  as 


124  ANATOMY 

it  makes  greater  concavity  of  arch  in  its  back,  as  one  sees  done  by  those 
contortionists  who  bend  themselves  so  far  backwards  that  they  cause 
their  hands  to  touch  their  feet,  and  this  excess  of  capacity  is  produced 
by  the  contraction  of  their  feet  with  their  hands,  and  these  muscles  are 
made  in  two  rows,  that  is  right  and  left,  from  the  necessity  of  bending 
to  right  and  left. 

The  transversal  muscles  c  d  are  those  which,  as  they  are  drawn,  con- 
strict and  raise  the  intestines  and  push  up  the  diaphragm  and  drive  out 
the  air  from  the  lung;  afterwards  as  these  muscles  become  relaxed  the 
bowels  drop  and  draw  back  the  diaphragm  and  the  lung  opens. 

a  b  is  all  made  up  of  cartilage  which  borders  on  the  sifac  and  starts 
from  the  fleshy  muscles  c  d,  which  muscles  enter  under  the  ribs  and 
are  latitudinal  muscles  starting  in  the  bone  of  the  spine,  and  it  is  these 
alone  which  squeeze  out  the  superfluities  from  the  body. 

Above  the  membrane  a  b  descend  the  longitudinal  muscles  n  m, 
mentioned  above,  which  start  in  the  last  ribs,  [run  up]  to  the  side  of 
the  Adam's  apple  and  end  below  in  the  pubis.  Fogli  b  15  r. 

[Muscles  of  the  trunl(\ 

Note  how  the  flesh  increases  above  the  bone  as  one  grows  fat,  and 
how  it  decreases  as  one  grows  thin,  and  what  shape  it  assumes  and  .  .  . 

The  muscle  a  b  becomes  fleshy  at  its  end  beneath  the  arm  and  in  the 
upper  part  and  in  the  lateral,  or  lower  in  the  flank,  and  behind  in  the 
bone  of  the  back,  and  in  front  in  the  middle  longitudinal  section  of 
the  body,  and  behind  it  ends  in  the  vertebrae  of  the  spine. 

The  muscles  n  m  o  p  q  are  situated  above  the  ribs,  and  with  their 
angles  they  are  converted  into  short  thick  cartilage,  and  they  unite 
with  the  ribs  where  they  rest,  and  immediately  there  start  other  muscles 
namely  a  m  n,  and  that  which  is  shown  appears  after  the  skin  has  been 
removed. 

a  b  c  is,  covered  by  the  muscle  a  above,  in  the  second  demonstration. 

All  the  muscles  which  start  in  the  body  are  converted  into  mem- 
branes, which  membranes  continue  with  the  opposite  muscle,  passing 
above  the  lower  part  of  the  belly,  as  are  the  transversal  and  the  slanting 
muscles;  but  the  longitudinal  or  straight  muscles  go  fleshy  from  the 
height  of  the  Adam's  apple  to  the  pubis;  and  the  muscle  of  the  breasts 
which  starts  from  all  the  middle  of  the  thorax  and  ends  in  the  bone  of

converted  into  membrane  and  clothes  the  whole  body.    Fogli  b  15  v. 

The  first  muscle  of  the  lower  part  of  the  belly  starts  in  its  upper  part 
in  the  sixth  rib  of  the  breast  and  ends  towards  the  arms  after  the  man- 
ner of  a  saw  in  the  muscles  which  start  over  the  ribs,  and  below  being 
changed  into  cartilage  it  ends  in  the  bone  of  the  hip  as  far  as  the  pubis. 

The  muscle  n  m  is  the  lower  transversal,  which  starts  in  the  vertebrae 
behind  the  navel,  passes  through  the  soft  parts  of  the  flank,  and  ends  in 
the  penultimate  false  rib,  and  becomes  changed  into  cartilage  above  the 
longitudinal  muscles;  it  becomes  fleshy  and  continues  as  far  as  the 
pubic  region.  Fogli  b  16  r. 

[Precepts  for  the  demonstration  of  the  muscles  of  the  thorax] 

The  demonstration  of  the  region  of  the  ribs  requires  first  the  plain 
sides  bare  with  open  spaces;  afterwards  the  muscles  which  are  joined  to 
their  sides  with  which  they  are  chained  together;  then  the  muscles  that 
interlace  above  them  which  serve  for  the  movements  of  expansion  and 
contraction  of  these  sides;  in  addition  to  this  the  other  muscles  crossed 
above  the  aforesaid  muscles,  at  different  angles,  serving  for  various 
movements. 

[Reason  of  the  movement  of  the  ribs] 

Of  the  maximum  raising  and  lowering  of  the  shoulders  which  checks 
the  movement  of  the  sides.  Because  the  maximum  raising  and  lower- 
ing of  the  shoulders  by  means  of  the  muscles  of  the  neck  which  have 
their  base  in  the  vertebrae  of  the  spine,  impedes  when  these  shoulders 
are  raised,  the  movement  of  the  ribs  in  their  descent;  and  as  these 
shoulders  are  lowered  the  movement  of  raising  these  sides  is  impeded. 

For  which  fact  nature  has  made  provision  by  means  of  the  muscles 
of  the  diaphragm  which  lower  this  diaphragm  in  its  concave  centre; 
and  when  it  is  raised  again  this  proceeds  from  the  compressed  wind 
enclosed  in  the  intestines,  which  wind  is  caused  by  the  fact  that  the 
excrements  as  they  dry  give  off  gases;  and  if  the  raised  shoulders  keep 
the  ribs  high  by  means  of  the  muscle  b  then  the  diaphragm  by  merely 
moving  itself  by  means  of  its  muscles  performs  the  function  of  opening 
and  closing  the  lung;  and  the  compressed  intestines  together  with  the 


i26  ANATOMY 

condensed  wind  which  is  generated  in  them  push  back  the  diaphragm 
upwards;  which  diaphragm  presses  the  lung  and  expels  the  air. 

[Muscles  of  the  anterior  wall  of  the  thorax  and  of  the  abdomen\ 

The  muscle  a  contains  in  itself  the  breast,  and  descends  fleshy  as  far 
as  the  seventh  rib  by  the  side  of  the  Adam's  apple;  then  having  been 
converted  into  membrane  it  proceeds  to  form  a  covering  over  all  the 
lower  part  of  the  belly  and  ends  by  joining  itself  to  the  bone  of  the 
pubis;  and  this  muscle  of  the  breast  is  composed  of  several  muscles 
which  all  start  in  the  thorax,  and  converge  and  end  in  the  part  of  the 
muscles  of  the  humerus. 

a  d  c  ends  in  the  bone  of  the  shoulder,  and  starts  in  the  middle  of  the 
thorax,  and  below  it  does  not  go  so  far  as  to  cover  b,  shown  above,  ex- 
cept by  its  cartilage,  with  which  it  covers  all  the  lower  part  of  the  belly, 
and  it  ends  in  the  flank  and  in  the  bone  of  the  pubis.       Fogli  b  16  v. 

[Lung] 

When  the  lung  has  sent  out  the  wind  and  so  is  diminished  in  quan- 
tity by  an  amount  corresponding  to  the  amount  of  the  wind  which 
emerged  from  it,  one  ought  then  to  consider  from  where  the  space  of 
the  cavity  of  the  lessened  lung  attracts  to  itself  the  air  which  fills  up  its 
increase,  because  in  nature  there  is  no  vacuum. 

And  one  asks  also,  since  after  the  lung  has  been  expanded  it  drives 
out  the  air  from  its  receptacle,  by  what  way  this  air  escapes  and  where 
it  is  received  after  it  has  escaped. 

[Mechanism  of  respiration.  Action  of  intercostal  muscles] 

The  lung  is  always  full  of  a  quantity  of  air,  even  when  it  has  driven 
out  that  air  which  is  necessary  for  its  exhalation;  and  when  it  is  re- 
freshed by  new  air  it  presses  on  the  sides  of  the  chest,  dilates  them  a 
little  and  pushes  them  outwards,  for  as  may  be  seen  and  felt  by  placing 
the  hand  upon  the  chest  during  its  breathing,  the  chest  expands  and 
contracts,  and  even  more  so  when  one  heaves  a  big  sigh.  For  nature 
has  so  willed  that  this  force  should  be  created  in  the  ribs  of  the  chest 
and  not  in  the  membrane  that  ends  the  substance  of  the  lung,  lest  by  an 
excessive  ingathering  of  air  in  order  to  form  some  unusually  deep  sigh 
this  membrane  may  come  to  break  and  burst  itself. 


ANATOMY  127 

[Function  of  the  diaphragm] 

The  diaphragm,  that  is  the  large  membrane  which  is  below  the 
points  of  the  lung,  is  not  altered  nor  pushed  in  any  part  by  the  increase 
of  the  lung,  for  this  lung  increases  in  width  and  not  in  length,  unless 
this  diaphragm  has  been  driven  by  the  wind  or  air  which  gives  place 
to  the  increase  of  the  lung,  for  it  would  then  be  possible  for  the  dia- 
phragm driven  by  the  air  to  give  place  to  its  increase,  and  for  the  air 
to  push  the  liver  and  the  liver  the  stomach  to  which  it  serves  as 
cover,  and  thus  would  follow  the  pushing  of  all  the  intestines,  and  this 
continual  movement  would  bring  about  the  evacuation  of  the  intestines 
with  so  much  greater  speed  as  the  exercise  of  the  man  was  performed 
with  greater  vigour. 

[Cause  of  the  formation  of  gas  in  the  intestines] 

Of  the  wind  that  is  produced  in  the  intestines  we  may  say  that  it  is 
caused  by  the  superfluous  quantity  which  collects  in  the  rectum,  which 
becomes  drier  as  the  moisture  in  it  evaporates  more;  and  this  vapour  in 
the  form  of  air  distends  the  bowels  and  produces  pains  on  finding  itself 
confined  within  the  colon. 

[Latitudinal  increase  of  the  lung  in  breathing.  How  its  expansion  acts 

upon  the  functions  of  the  stomach] 

The  increase  of  the  lung  when  it  is  filled  with  air  is  latitudinal  and 
not  in  its  length,  as  may  be  seen  by  inflating  the  lung  of  a  pig;  and  the 
air  which  is  interposed  between  the  lung  when  not  inflated  and  the 
ribs  which  surround  it,  as  the  lung  becomes  extended  escapes  in  the 
part  below  between  the  lung  and  the  diaphragm,  and  causes  this  dia- 
phragm to  swell  downwards,  against  the  stomach,  whereat  this  stomach 
being  pressed  transmits  the  things  contained  within  it  to  the  intestines. 

[Action  of  the  expansion  of  the  lungs  upon  the  pericardium  and  func- 
tion of  the  pericardial  fluid] 

Moreover  this  air  pressed  between  the  lung  and  the  diaphragm  rests 
in  the  case  which  encloses  the  heart,  and  that  small  quantity  of  fluid 
which  is  at  the  bottom  of  this  case  raises  itself  and  bathes  the  whole 
heart,  and  so  continually  by  thus  bathing  it  it  moistens  the  heated 
heart  and  prevents  it  from  becoming  parched  through  the  extent  of  its 
movement.  Fogli  b  17  r.

[Origin  of  the  whole  body  from  the  heart] 

The  whole  body  has  origin  from  the  heart  as  regards  its  first  cre- 
ation; and  the  blood  therefore  and  the  veins  and  nerves  do  the  like, 
although  these  nerves  seem  manifestly  all  to  start  from  the  spinal  mar- 
row, and  to  be  remote  from  the  heart,  and  the  spinal  marrow  to  be  of 
the  same  substance  as  the  brain  from  whence  it  is  derived.

Tree  of  all  the  nerves,  and  it  is  shown  how  these  all  have  origin  from

[Precepts  for  anatomical  demonstrations] 

Remember  never  to  change  the  contour  lines  of  any  limb  by  any 
muscle  that  you  remove  in  order  to  uncover  another;  and  if  you  only 
remove  muscles  of  which  one  of  its  contour  lines  is  contour  line  of  a 
part  of  the  limb  from  which  you  detach  it,  you  ought  then  to  indicate 
with  frequent  dots  the  contour  line  of  that  limb  which  was  removed 
by  the  separation  of  any  muscle;  and  this  you  will  do  so  that  the  shape 
of  that  limb  which  you  describe  may  not  remain  an  unnatural  thing 
through  having  its  parts  taken  away.  And  in  addition  to  this  there 
ensues  a  greater  knowledge  of  the  whole,  for  when  the  part  has  been 
taken  away  you  see  in  the  whole  the  true  shape  of  the  part  whence  it 
was  taken.  Fogli  b  18  r. 

[Of  the  muscles] 

The  long  muscle  a  b  and  the  long  muscle  a  c  serve  to  raise  the  thigh 
forward. 

And  they  also  give  this  thigh  lateral  movements,  namely  in  spread- 
ing out  and  contracting  these  thighs;  and  the  process  of  the  thickening 
and  contraction  of  the  muscle  a  c  comes  into  play  in  the  spreading  out 
of  this  thigh,  and  of  the  long  muscle  a  b  in  its  contraction. 

[Of  the  rotatory  movement  of  the  thigh] 

The  part  of  the  rotatory  movement  of  the  thigh  to  right  and  left  is 
caused  by  the  aforesaid  muscles;  that  is  the  muscle  a  c  turns  the  thigh 


ANATOMY  129 

inward,  and  the  long  muscle  a  b  turns  it  back  outward,  and  the  two 
together  raise  the  thigh. 

[Reason  of  the  insertions  of  the  muscles] 

The  muscles  always  begin  and  end  in  the  bones  that  touch  one  an- 
other, and  they  never  begin  and  end  in  the  same  bone,  for  it  would  not 
be  able  to  move  anything  unless  this  was  itself  in  a  state  of  rarity  or 
density. 

Which  are  the  muscles  which  begin  and  finish  on  one  side  upon  one 
bone  and  on  the  other  upon  another  muscle?

On  to  the  knee  arrive  all  the  muscles  of  the  thigh  which  are  changed

thin  cartilage  with  which  is  bound  the  joint  of  the  knee  with  as  many 
peels  or  membranous  jackets  as  are  the  muscles  which  descend  from 
this  thigh  to  the  knee;  and  these  ligaments  extend  four  fingers'  space

And  also  of  those  which  bend  the  leg  when  one  kneels. 

[Notes  concerning  the  muscles  which   become  uncovered  and  hide 

themselves  in  their  movement] 

Different  muscles  become  uncovered  in  the  different  movements  of 
the  animals,  and  different  muscles  are  those  which  hide  themselves  in 
such  diversity  of  movement;  and  concerning  this  it  is  necessary  to  make 
a  long  treatise  for  the  purpose  of  recognising  the  places  that  have  been 
injured  by  wounds,  and  also  for  the  convenience  of  sculptors  and 
painters. 

[Origin  of  the  movements  of  the  legs  and  feet] 

All  the  movements  of  the  leg  start  from  the  muscles  of  the  thigh, 
which  movements  are  the  cause  of  the  bending  of  the  leg,  of  the 
straightening  of  it  when  bent  and  of  its  turning  to  right  or  left. 

But  the  movements  of  the  feet  are  caused  by  the  muscles  which  start 
in  the  leg;  of  the  movements  of  the  toes  some  start  in  the  leg  and  some 
in  the  foot.

OF  THE  ORDER  OF  THE  BOOK 

This  work  should  commence  with  the  conception  of  man,  and 
should  describe  the  nature  of  the  womb,  and  how  the  child  inhabits  it, 


ANATOMY  131 

tnd  in  what  stage  it  dwells  there,  and  the  manner  of  its  quickening 
and  feeding,  and  its  growth,  and  what  interval  there  is  between  one 
Itage  of  growth  and  another,  and  what  thing  drives  it  forth  from  the 
body  of  the  mother,  and  for  what  reason  it  sometimes  emerges  from 
the  belly  of  its  mother  before  the  due  time. 

Then  you  should  describe  which  are  the  limbs  that  grow  more  than 
the  others  after  the  child  is  born;  and  give  the  measurements  of  a 
child  of  one  year. 

Then  describe  the  man  fully  grown,  and  the  woman,  and  their  meas- 
urements, and  the  nature  of  their  complexions  colour  and  physiog- 
nomy. 

Afterwards  describe  how  he  is  composed  of  veins,  nerves,  muscles 
and  bones.  This  you  should  do  at  the  end  of  the  book. 

Then  represent  in  four  histories  four  universal  conditions  of  man- 
kind namely,  joy,  with  various  modes  of  laughing,  and  represent  the 
cause  of  the  laughter;  weeping,  the  various  ways  with  their  cause; 
strife  with  various  movements  expressive  of  slaughterings,  flights,  fear, 
acts  of  ferocity,  daring,  homicide  and  all  the  things  which  connect  with 
cases  such  as  these. 

Then  make  a  figure  to  represent  labour,  in  the  act  of  dragging, 
pushing,  carrying,  restraining,  supporting  and  conditions  such  as  these. 

Then  describe  the  attitude  and  movement. 

Then  perspective  through  the  office  of  the  sight  or  the  hearing.  You 
should  make  mention  of  music  and  describe  the  other  senses. 

Afterwards  describe  the  nature  of  the  five  senses. 

We  shall  describe  this  mechanical  structure  of  man  by  means  of  dia- 
grams of  which  the  three  first  will  treat  of  the  ramification  of  the 
bones;  that  is  one  from  the  front  which  shows  the  positions  and  shapes

And  when  the  chest  is  arched  the  breasts  are  always  higher  than  the

Methinks  that  coarse  men  of  bad  habits  and  little  power  of  reason 
do  not  deserve  so  fine  an  instrument  or  so  great  a  variety  of  mechanism 
as  those  endowed  with  ideas  and  with  great  reasoning  power,  but 
merely  a  sack  wherein  their  food  is  received,  and  from  whence  it 
passes  away. 

For  in  truth  one  can  only  reckon  them  as  a  passage  for  food;  since 
it  does  not  seem  to  me  that  they  have  anything  in  common  with  the 
human  race  except  speech  and  shape,  and  in  all  else  they  are  far  below 
the  level  of  the  beasts. 

[Attitude  in  ascending]

most.

[Attitude  in  stopping  a  course] 

When  the  man  wishes  to  arrest  his  course  and  to  consume  his  im- 
petus, necessity  causes  him  to  lean  back  and  to  make  short  quick  steps. 

[Mechanism  of  certain  movements  of  the  human  body  and  foundation 

of  human  static s] 

The  centre  of  the  weight  of  the  man  who  raises  one  of  his  feet  from 
the  ground  rests  above  the  centre  of  the  sole  of  the  foot. 

[Mechanism  of  the  ascent] 

The  man  who  goes  up  stairs  puts  as  much  of  his  weight  in  front  and 
at  the  side  of  the  upper  foot  as  he  puts  as  counterpoise  to  the  lower  leg, 
and  in  consequence  the  work  of  the  lower  leg  only  extends  to  moving 
itself. 

The  first  thing  that  the  man  does  when  he  ascends  by  steps  is  to  free 
the  leg  which  he  wishes  to  raise  from  the  heaviness  of  the  bust  which  is 
resting  upon  this  leg,  and  in  addition  to  this  he  loads  the  opposite  leg 
with  all  the  rest  of  the  bulk  of  the  man  together  with  the  other  leg; 
then  he  raises  the  leg  and  places  the  foot  upon  the  step  where  he  wishes 
to  raise  it;  having  done  this  he  gives  back  to  the  higher  foot  all  the  rest 
of  the  weight  of  the  bust  and  of  the  leg,  leans  his  hand  upon  his  thigh, 
thrusts  the  head  forward  and  makes  a  movement  towards  the  point  of 
the  higher  foot,  raising  swiftly  the  heel  of  the  lower  foot,  and  with  the 
impetus  thus  acquired  raises  himself  up,  and  at  the  same  time  extends 
the  arm  which  he  was  resting  upon  the  knee,  and  this  extension  of  the 
arm  pushes  the  bust  and  head  upwards  and  thus  straightens  the  curve 
of  the  back.  Fogli  b  21  v. 

[  Veins] 

OF  THE  OLD  MAN 

Veins  which  mark  with  their  main  lines  here  and  there  the  base  of 
the  stomach  and  proceed  to  ramify  through  the  network  that  covers 
the  intestines. 

b  a  c  is  the  vein  which  extends  from  the  spleen  to  the  gate  of  the 
liver  and  passes  behind  the  stomach,  and  from  a  divide  the  vein  and 
the  artery  which  ramify  in  the  net  that  covers  the  intestines;  that  is 
from  a  there  proceed  two  veins  which  pass  under  the  bottom  of  the 


ANATOMY  135 

stomach,  the  one  behind  between  the  ribs  and  the  stomach,  and  the 
other  in  front,  and  proceed  as  has  been  said  to  ramify  through  the 
peritoneum  behind  and  through  the  peritoneum  in  front,  which  is 
double  as  the  figure  shows;  and  that  which  the  veins  do  is  found  to 
be  done  by  the  artery. 

[Change  of  the  vessels  in  the  old] 

I  have  found  in  the  decrepit  how  the  vein  which  proceeds  from  the 
door  of  the  liver  crosses  behind  the  stomach  and  ramifies  in  the  spleen, 
as  this  ramification,  the  veins  in  the  young  being  straight  and  full  of 
blood,  and  in  the  old  they  are  twisted,  flattened,  wrinkled  and  emptied 
of  blood. 

[Changes  in  the  liver  in  age] 

And  thus  the  liver  which  in  youth  is  usually  of  a  deep  colour  and  of 
uniform  consistency,  in  the  old  is  pale,  without  any  redness  of  blood, 
and  the  veins  stay  empty  amidst  the  substance  of  this  liver,  which  sub- 
stance may  be  likened  for  its  thin  texture  to  bran  steeped  in  a  small 
quantity  of  water,  and  so  readily  disintegrating  on  being  washed,  leav- 
ing the  veins  that  ramify  within  it  freed  from  all  the  substance  of  the 
liver.  Fogli  b  22  r. 

[Precepts  upon  the  topography  of  the  intestines] 

Remember  to  mark  the  height  of  the  stomach  above  the  navel  and 
with  the  Adam's  apple,  and  how  the  spleen  and  the  heart  stand  with 
the  left  breast,  and  how  stand  the  kidneys  or  reins  with  the  hips,  and 
me  colon  and  bladder  and  other  intestines,  and  how  much  more  or  less 
remote  they  are  from  the  spine  than  from  the  longitudinal  muscles, 
and  describe  thus  all  the  body  with  the  veins  and  nerves. 

[Thinness  of  the  colon  in  the  old] 

The  colon  in  the  old  becomes  as  slender  as  the  middle  finger  of  the 
hand,  and  in  the  young  it  is  equal  to  the  maximum  breadth  of  the  arm. 

[Retraction  of  the  omentum  in  the  old] 

The  net  which  stands  between  the  sifac  and  the  intestines  in  the  case 
of  the  old  uncovers  all  these  intestines  of  itself  and  withdraws  between 
the  bottom  of  the  stomach  and  the  upper  part  of  the  bowels.

136  ANATOMY 

[Spinal  marrow  and  nerves] 

These  two  crusts  which  clothe  the  spinal  marrow  are  the  same  as 
clothe  the  brain,  that  is,  the  pia  and  dura  mater. 

Vertebrae  of  the  neck  sawn  through  and  removed  from  the  middle 
in  front,  and  the  situation  of  the  spinal  marrow  revealed  and  how  it 
lives  and  ramifies  outside  these  vertebrae. 

[Anatomical  and  functional  relations  between  nerves  and  muscles] 

The  substance  of  the  spinal  marrow  enters  for  a  certain  distance 
within  the  origins  of  the  nerves,  and  then  follows  the  hollow  nerve  as 
far  as  its  last  ramifications;  by  which  perforation  it  conveys  sensation 
in  each  muscle,  which  muscle  is  composed  of  as  many  other  very 
minute  muscles  as  there  are  threads  into  which  this  muscle  can  be 
resolved;  and  each  of  the  least  of  these  muscles  is  wrapped  up  in  almost 
imperceptible  membranes  into  which  the  final  ramifications  of  the  be- 
fore mentioned  nerves  become  changed,  for  these  obey  in  order  to  con- 
tract the  muscle  as  they  retire,  and  to  cause  it  to  expand  again  with 
each  demand  of  the  sensation  which  passes  through  the  vacuity  of  the 
nerve.  But  to  return  to  the  spinal  marrow,  this  is  wrapped  in  two  mem- 
branes of  which  only  one  clothes  the  pith-like  substance  of  the  spinal 
marrow,  and  in  emerging  from  the  hollow  of  vertebrae  is  transformed 
into  nerve;  the  other  clothes  the  nerve,  together  with  its  principal 
branches,  and  ramifies  together  with  each  branch  of  the  nerve,  and 
thus  forms  the  second  cover  of  the  spinal  marrow,  interposing  itself 
between  the  bone  of  the  vertebrae  and  the  first  membrane  of  this  spinal 
marrow. 

The  spinal  marrow  is  the  source  of  the  nerves  which  give  voluntary 
movement  to  the  limbs. 

The  pia  and  the  dura  mater  clothe  all  the  nerves  which  start  from 
the  spinal  marrow.  Fogli  b  23  r.

And  then  you  will  make  this  ramification  with  the  muscles  attached

which  join  themselves  with  these  bones  without  other  confusion  of 
other  muscles,  and  with  these  you  will  place  the  nerves  and  veins  which 
feed  them,  having  first  made  the  tree  of  the  veins  and  nerves  above

[Of  the  nature  of  the  teeth  and  their  position  and  removal  from  the 

axis  of  their  movements] 

That  tooth  has  less  power  in  gripping  which  is  more  remote  from 
the  centre  of  its  movement.  As  if  the  centre  of  the  movement  of  the 
teeth  were  a  the  axis  of  the  jaw  I  say  that  in  proportion  as  these  teeth 
are  more  distant  from  this  centre  a  they  have  less  power  in  their  grip; 
therefore  d  e  is  less  powerful  in  its  grip  than  the  teeth  b  c\  and  from 
this  follows  the  corollary  which  says: — that  tooth  is  more  powerful 
which  is  nearer  to  the  centre  of  its  movement  or  the  axis  of  its  move- 
ment; that  is  the  grip  of  the  teeth  b  c  is  more  powerful  than  that  of 
the  teeth  d  e.  (Nature  made  them  less  able  to  penetrate  into  food  and 
with  heavier  points  which  are  of  greater  power.)  Therefore  the  teeth 
b  c  will  have  their  points  so  much  the  more  obtuse  as  they  are  moved 
by  greater  power;  and  for  this  reason  the  teeth  b  c  will  be  more  obtuse 
in  proportion  to  the  teeth  d  e  when  they  are  nearer  the  axis  a  of  the 
jaws  a  d  and  a  e;  and  for  this  reason  nature  has  made  the  molars  with 
large  crowns  to  enable  them  to  grind  the  food  and  not  to  penetrate 
it  or  cut  it;  and  in  front  has  made  the  teeth  sharp  and  penetrating  and 
not  suitable  for  grinding  this  food,  and  has  made  the  eye  teeth  be- 
tween the  molars  and  the  incisors.  Fogli  b  24  r. 

[Reaction   of  pupil  to   stimulus  of  light,  dilation   and  constriction] 
In  the  nocturnal  animals  the  pupil  proceeds  to  vary  from  a  large  to 

a  larger  size  according  to  the  great  or  greater  obscurity  of  the  night. 
In  these  nocturnal  animals  the  pupil  also  varies  from  a  small  to  a 

smaller  size  according  to  the  great  or  greater  brightness  of  the  day. 
From  what  has  been  said  one  concludes  that  these  nocturnal  animals 

have  always  the  same  power  of  visual  faculty  in  all  the  varieties  of 

brightness  or  obscurity  which  can  occur  in  times  of  day  and  of  night. 


ANATOMY  139 

The  visual  faculty  is  all  in  the  whole  pupil  and  all  in  each  of  its 
parts. 

It  follows  that  the  half  of  the  pupil  sees  the  object  in  its  entirety  as 
if  it  was  whole. 

In  proportion  as  the  pupil  is  greater  in  quantity  it  will  see  its  object 
as  of  greater  shape  and  clearness;  and  thus  conversely  in  proportion  as 
it  is  less  it  will  see  this  object  as  so  much  smaller  and  more  obscure. 

It  follows  that  if  one  eye  be  closed  the  power  of  sight  is  diminished 
by  half;  and  this  may  be  proved  with  luminous  bodies  such  as  the  sun 
the  moon  and  the  stars,  and  also  with  a  light  or  fire. 

This  diminution  of  brightness  may  be  observed  without  closing  one 
of  the  eyes;  but  in  lieu  of  closing  it  you  must  interpose  the  hand  or  the 
finger  in  front  of  one  of  the  pupils  between  the  air  and  the  eye,  and  you 
will  see  with  the  two  pupils  a  tract  of  air  which  will  have  the  same 
boundary  as  the  air  seen  by  the  one  pupil  alone,  and  that  which  is  seen 
by  one  pupil  will  be  just  as  much  darker  than  that  which  is  seen  by 
two  pupils.  And  the  reason  is  as  the  diagram  shows.     Fogli  b  25  r. 

[Precepts  for  the  topographical  demonstration  of  the  muscles  of  the

You  will  make  the  rule  and  the  measurement  of  each  muscle  and 
you  will  give  the  reason  of  all  their  functions,  and  the  manner  in  which 
they  use  them  and  who  moves  them. 

You  will  make  first  the  spine  of  the  back;  then  proceed  to  clothe  it 
in  stages,  one  above  the  other,  of  each  of  these  muscles,  and  place  the

intestines  are  opposite  to  them,  and  what  bones  and  other  organic 
instruments. 

The  higher  parts  of  the  thin  are  higher  in  those  who  have  well 
developed  muscles,  and  similarly  with  fat  ones;  but  the  difference  that 
there  is  between  the  shape  of  the  muscles  of  those  who  are  fat  in  com- 
parison with  those  who  have  well  developed  muscles  will  be  described 
here  below.  Fogli  b  27  r. 


140  ANATOMY 

OF  THE  FUNCTION  OF  THE  INTERCOSTAL  MUSCLES 

The  three  muscles  which  draw  up  the  ribs  we  call  the  drawing 
muscles. 

To  the  five  [four?]  muscles  c  d  e  f  being  created  for  the  expansion 
of  the  breast  we  give  the  name  of  the  expanding  muscles. 

The  intercostal  are  the  minute  muscles  interposed  between  the  ribs 
which  serve  for  the  dilatation  and  attraction  of  those  of  these  ribs;  and 
these  two  so  diametrically  opposite  movements  are  ordained  for  the 
purpose  of  collecting  and  breathing  out  the  air  in  the  lung  which  is 
enclosed  in  the  region  of  the  ribs;  and  the  dilatation  of  these  ribs  pro- 
ceeds from  the  external  muscles  of  the  ribs  which  are  arranged  as  in 
the  slant  m  n  with  the  help  of  the  three  muscles  o  p  q,  which  as  they 
draw  the  ribs  with  great  force  upward  extend  their  capacity  in  the 
manner  that  one  sees  done  with  the  ventricles  of  the  heart;  but  the 
ribs  having  to  turn  downwards  would  not  of  themselves  be  able  to 
descend  if  the  man  remained  lying  down,  if  it  were  not  for  the  internal 
muscles  which  have  an  opposite  slant  to  the  external  muscles,  which 
slant  extends  along  the  line  /  n. 


OF  THE  POWER  OF  THE  INTERCOSTAL  [MUSCLES] 

The  function  of  the  external  intercostal  muscles  is  to  raise  and  ex- 
pand the  ribs  and  they  are  of  admirable  power  in  their  position;  seeing 
that  they  are  established  with  their  last  upper  extremities  upon  the 
same  spine  where  begin  the  loose  ribs,  and  their  slant  descends  towards 
the  navel.  Fogli  b  27  v. 

[Of  fingers  and  toes] 

Each  protuberance  formed  by  the  joints  of  the  toes  and  fingers  has 
a  hollow  in  the  toes  and  fingers  contiguous  to  it  which  receives  within 
itself  this  roundness;  and  this  nature  has  done  in  order  not  to  render 
their  width  misshapen,  seeing  that  if  the  said  protuberances  were  in 
contact  between  them  the  feet  would  become  of  great  width,  and  one 
of  two  effects  would  also  be  necessary,  that  is  that  either  the  fingers 
would  all  be  of  the  same  length,  or  that  one  would  have  two  joints  and 
the  other  one  as  will  be  demonstrated  concerning  the  bones,  in  its  place. 


ANATOMY  141 

HOW  THE  BODY  OF  THE  ANIMAL  CONTINUALLY 
DIES  AND  IS  RENEWED 

The  body  of  anything  whatsoever  that  receives  nourishment  con- 
tinually dies  and  is  continually  renewed.  For  the  nourishment  cannot 
enter  except  in  those  places  where  the  preceding  nourishment  is  ex- 
hausted, and  if  it  is  exhausted  it  no  longer  has  life.  Unless  therefore  you 
supply  nourishment  equivalent  to  that  which  has  departed,  the  life  fails 
in  its  vigour;  and  if  you  deprive  it  of  this  nourishment,  the  life  is  com- 
pletely destroyed.  But  if  you  supply  it  with  just  so  much  as  is  destroyed 
day  by  day,  then  it  renews  its  life  just  as  much  as  it  is  consumed;  like 
the  light  of  this  candle  formed  by  the  nourishment  given  to  it  by  the 
fat  of  this  candle,  which  light  is  also  continually  renewed  by  swiftest 
succour  from  beneath,  in  proportion  as  the  upper  part  is  consumed 
and  dies,  and  in  dying  becomes  changed  from  radiant  light  to  murky 
smoke.  And  this  death  extends  for  so  long  as  the  smoke  continues;  and 
the  period  of  duration  of  the  smoke  is  the  same  as  that  of  what  feeds 
it,  and  in  an  instant  the  whole  light  dies  and  is  entirely  regenerated 
by  the  movement  of  that  which  nourishes  it;  and  its  life  receives  from 
it  also  its  ebb  and  flow,  as  the  flicker  of  its  point  serves  to  show  us.  The 
same  process  also  comes  to  pass  in  the  bodies  of  the  animals  by  means 
of  the  beating  of  the  heart,  whereby  there  is  produced  a  wave  of  blood 
in  all  the  veins,  and  these  are  continually  either  enlarging  or  contract- 
ing, because  the  expansion  occurs  when  they  receive  the  excessive 
quantity  of  blood,  and  the  contraction  is  due  to  the  departure  of  the 
excess  of  blood  they  have  received;  and  this  the  beating  of  the  pulse 
teaches  us,  when  we  touch  the  aforesaid  veins  with  the  fingers  in  any 
part  whatsoever  of  the  living  body. 

But  to  return  to  our  purpose,  I  say  that  the  flesh  of  the  animals  is 
made  anew  by  the  blood  which  is  continually  produced  by  that  which 
nourishes  them,  and  that  this  flesh  is  destroyed  and  returns  by  the 
mesaraic  arteries  and  passes  into  the  intestines,  where  it  putrifies  in  a 
foul  and  fetid  death,  as  they  show  us  in  their  deposits  and  steam  like 
the  smoke  and  fire  which  were  given  as  a  comparison.     Fogli  b  28  r.

before  it,  and  of  the  smell  with  its  infinite  mixture  of  odours,  and  of 
the  ear  with  its  sounds,  we  may  reply  that  the  tongue  also  perceives  an 
infinite  number  of  flavours  both  simple  and  compounded;  but  this  is 
not  to  our  purpose,  for  our  intention  is  to  treat  only  of  the  particular 
movement  of  each  member. 

Consider  carefully  how  by  the  movement  of  the  tongue,  with  the 
help  of  the  lips  and  teeth,  the  pronunciation  of  all  the  names  of  things 
is  known  to  us;  and  how,  by  means  of  this  instrument,  the  simple  and 
compound  words  of  a  language  arrive  at  our  ears;  and  how  these,  if 
there  were  a  name  for  all  the  effects  of  nature,  would  approach  infinity 
in  number,  together  with  all  the  countless  things  which  are  in  action 
and  in  the  power  of  nature;  and  these  would  not  be  expressed  in  one 
language  only,  but  in  a  great  number  of  languages,  and  these  also 
would  tend  to  infinite  variety,  because  they  vary  continually  from 
century  to  century,  and  in  one  country  and  another,  through  the  inter- 
mingling of  the  peoples,  who  by  wars  or  other  mischances  are  con- 
tinually becoming  mixed  with  each  other;  and  these  same  languages 
are  liable  to  pass  into  oblivion,  and  they  are  mortal  like  all  the  rest  of 
created  things;  and  if  we  grant  that  our  world  is  everlasting  we  shall 
then  say  that  these  languages  have  been,  and  still  must  be,  of  infinite 
variety,  through  the  infinite  number  of  centuries  which  constitute 
infinite  time. 

Nor  is  this  true  in  the  case  of  any  other  sense;  for  these  are  concerned 
only  with  such  things  as  nature  is  continually  producing,  and  she  does 
not  change  the  ordinary  kinds  of  things  which  she  creates  in  the  same 
way  that  from  time  to  time  the  things  which  have  been  created  by 
man  are  changed;  and  indeed  man  is  nature's  chiefest  instrument,  be- 
cause nature  is  concerned  only  with  the  production  of  elementary 
things,  but  man  from  these  elementary  things  produces  an  infinite

number  of  compounds,  although  he  has  no  power  to  create  any  natural 
thing  except  another  like  himself,  that  is  his  children.  And  of  this  the 
old  alchemists  will  serve  as  my  witnesses,  who  have  never  either  by 
chance  or  deliberate  experiment  succeeded  in  creating  the  smallest 
thing  which  can  be  created  by  nature;  and  indeed  this  generation  de- 
serves unmeasured  praises  for  the  serviceableness  of  the  things  which 
they  have  invented  for  the  use  of  men,  and  would  deserve  them  even 
more  if  they  had  not  been  the  inventors  of  noxious  things  like  poisons 
and  other  similar  things  which  destroy  the  life  or  the  intellect;  but  they 
are  not  exempt  from  blame  in  that  by  much  study  and  experiment  they 
are  seeking  to  create,  not,  indeed,  the  meanest  of  nature's  products,  but 
the  most  excellent,  namely  gold,  which  is  begotten  of  the  sun  inasmuch 
as  it  has  more  resemblance  to  it  than  to  anything  else  that  is,  and  no 
created  thing  is  more  enduring  than  this  gold.  It  is  immune  from  de- 
struction by  fire,  which  has  power  over  all  the  rest  of  created  things, 
reducing  them  to  ashes,  glass  or  smoke.  If,  however,  insensate  avarice 
should  drive  you  into  such  error,  why  do  you  not  go  to  the  mines 
where  nature  produces  this  gold,  and  there  become  her  disciple?  She 
will  completely  cure  you  of  your  folly  by  showing  you  that  nothing 
which  you  employ  in  your  furnace  will  be  numbered  among  the  things 
which  she  employs  in  order  to  produce  this  gold.  For  there  is  there  no 
quick-silver,  no  sulphur  of  any  kind,  no  fire  nor  other  heat  than  that 
of  nature  giving  life  to  our  world;  and  she  will  show  you  the  veins  of 
the  gold  spreading  through  the  stone, — the  blue  lapis  lazuli,  whose 
colour  is  unaffected  by  the  power  of  the  fire. 

And  consider  carefully  this  ramification  of  the  gold,  and  you  will 
see  that  the  extremities  of  it  are  continually  expanding  in  slow  move- 
ment, transmuting  into  gold  whatever  they  come  in  contact  with;  and 
note  that  therein  is  a  living  organism  which  it  is  not  within  your  power 
to  produce.  Fogli  b  28  v. 


OF  THE  MUSCLES  WHICH  MOVE  THE  LIPS  OF  THE  MOUTH 

The  muscles  which  move  the  lips  of  the  mouth  are  more  numerous 
in  man  than  in  any  other  animal;  and  this  order  is  a  necessity  for  him 
on  account  of  the  many  undertakings  in  which  these  lips  are  continu- 
ally employing  themselves,  as  in  the  four  letters  of  the  alphabet  b  f

Also  in  the  strange  contortions  used  by  clowns  when  they  imitate  faces. 

WHAT  MUSCLE  IS  THAT  WHICH  SO  TIGHTENS  THE  MOUTH 
THAT  ITS  LATERAL  BOUNDARIES  COME  NEAR  TOGETHER? 

The  muscles  which  tighten  the  mouth  lessening  thus  its  length  are 
in  the  lips  themselves;  or  rather  these  lips  are  the  actual  muscles  which 
close  themselves.  It  is  true  that  the  muscle  alters  the  position  of  the  lip 
below  the  other  muscles  which  are  joined  to  it,  of  which  one  pair  are 
those  that  distend  it  and  move  it  to  laughter;  and  that  which  contracts 
it  is  the  same  muscle  of  which  the  lower  lip  is  formed,  which  restrains 
it  by  drawing  in  its  extremities  toward  its  centre;  and  the  same  process 
goes  on  at  the  same  time  with  the  upper  lip;  and  there  are  other  mus- 
cles which  bring  the  lips  to  a  point  and  others  that  flatten  them,  others 
are  those  which  cause  them  to  curl  back,  others  that  straighten  them, 
others  which  twist  them  all  awry,  and  others  that  bring  them  back  to 
their  first  position;  and  so  always  there  are  found  as  many  muscles 
as  correspond  to  the  various  attitudes  of  these  lips  and  as  many  others 
as  serve  to  reverse  these  attitudes;  and  these  it  is  my  purpose  here  to 
describe  and  represent  in  full,  proving  these  movements  by  means  of 
my  mathematical  principles. 

OF  THE  MOVEMENTS  OF  THE  MUSCLES  OF  THE  MOUTH 
WITH  ITS  LATERAL  MUSCLES 

There  are  many  occasions  when  the  muscles  that  form  the  lips  of  the 
mouth  move  the  lateral  muscles  that  are  joined  to  them,  and  there  are 
an  equal  number  of  occasions  when  these  lateral  muscles  move  the  lips 
of  this  mouth,  replacing  it  where  it  cannot  return  of  itself,  because  the 
function  of  muscle  is  to  pull  and  not  to  push  except  in  the  case  of  the 
genitals  and  the  tongue.  But  if  the  contracting  of  the  mouth  draws 
back  its  lateral  muscles  equally  this  mouth  will  not  of  itself  regain  its 
lost  length  unless  the  said  lateral  muscles  go  back  there;  and  if  these 
lateral  muscles  extend  the  length  of  the  mouth  for  the  creation  of 
laughter  it  is  necessary  for  these  lateral  muscles  to  be  drawn  back  by 
the  contracting  of  the  mouth  when  laughter  ceases.        Fogli  b  29  r.

[Umbilical  cord  and  rein] 

These  four  nerves  have  not  in  themselves  any  portion  of  blood;  but 
when  they  enter  the  navel  they  become  changed  into  a  thick  vein 
which  then  extends  to  the  gate  of  the  liver  and  goes  ramifying  through 
its  lower  part,  in  which  part  each  of  its  lowest  ramifications  ends  and 
does  not  extend  any  higher. 

Of  the  aforesaid  four  umbilical  veins  the  outer  pair  form  the  sifac, 
the  membrance  adjacent  to  the  peritoneum,  and  then  bend  downwards 
and  end  in  the  first  ramification  of  the  vein  and  the  greater  artery, 
which  lies  over  the  spine  of  the  back. 

The  exterior  ramification  of  the  umbilical  vein  is  enclosed  between 
the  first  and  the  second  membranes  with  which  frequently  the  child 
is  born. 

[Origin   of  the  umbilical  vein;  its  relation   with  the  artery  and  its 

course] 

This  umbilical  vein  is  the  origin  of  all  the  veins  of  the  creature  that 
is  produced  in  the  matrix,  and  it  does  not  take  its  origin  in  any  vein  of 
the  pregnant  woman,  because  each  of  these  veins  is  entirely  separated 
and  divided  from  the  veins  of  the  pregnant  woman,  and  the  veins  and 
arteries  are  found  together  in  pairs;  and  it  is  extremely  rare  for  one  to 
be  found  without  the  other  being  in  company  with  it,  and  the  artery 
is  almost  always  found  above  the  vein  because  the  blood  of  the  artery 
is  the  passage  for  the  vital  spirit,  and  the  blood  of  the  veins  is  that 
which  nourishes  the  creature.  And  of  these  ramifications  represented 
those  which  are  raised  up  are  ordained  for  the  nourishment  of  the  third 
thin  membrane  of  the  matrix,  and  the  lower  veins,  set  obliquely,  are 
those  which  feed  the  last  membrane  which  is  contiguous  to  the  animal 
that  is  clothed  by  it;  and  both  the  one  and  the  other  of  these  mem- 
branes often  emerges,  together  with  the  creature,  out  of  the  matrix  of 
the  mother;  and  this  occurs  when  the  animal  is  not  able  to  break  it 
for  then  it  emerges  enveloped;  and  this  is  an  easy  thing,  because  these 
two  extremely  thin  membranes  as  has  been  said  above  are  not  in  any 
way  connected  with  the  said  matrix  which  is  also  equipped  with  two 
membranes  of  considerable  thickness,  fleshy  and  covered  with  nerves.

CONCERNING  THE  NERVES  THAT  COMMUNICATE 

SENSATION  TO  THE  INTERCOSTAL  MUSCLES 

(MESOPLEURI) 

The  small  muscles  situated  slantwise  which  descend  from  the  upper 
part  of  the  spine  and  terminate  towards  the  Adam's  apple  derive  their 
name  from  the  pleura,  and  they  are  interposed  between  one  rib  and 
another  merely  in  order  to  contract  the  intervening  spaces;  and  the 
nerves  which  communicate  sensation  to  these  muscles  have  their  origin 
in  the  spinal  marrow  which  passes  through  the  backbone,  and  the  low- 
est point  at  which  they  start  in  the  spinal  marrow  is  where  the  spine 
borders  upon  the  reins.  Fogli  b  30  r. 

OF  SPIRITS 

We  have  just  now  stated  that  the  definition  of  a  spirit  is  a  power 
united  to  a  body,  because  of  itself  it  can  neither  offer  resistance  nor  take 
any  kind  of  local  movement;  and  if  you  say  that  it  does  in  itself  ofler 
resistance,  this  cannot  be  so  within  the  elements,  because  if  the  spirit 
is  a  quantity  without  a  body,  this  quantity  is  what  is  called  a  vacuum, 
and  the  vacuum  does  not  exist  in  nature,  and  granting  that  one  were 
formed,  it  would  be  instantly  filled  up  by  the  falling  in  of  that  element 
within  which  such  a  vacuum  had  been  created.  So  by  the  definition  of 
weight  which  says  that  gravity  is  a  fortuitous  power  created  by  one  ele- 
ment being  drawn  or  impelled  towards  another,  it  follows  that  any 
element,  though  without  weight  when  in  the  same  element,  acquires 
weight  in  the  element  above  it,  which  is  lighter  than  itself;  so  one  sees 
that  one  part  of  the  water  has  neither  gravity  nor  levity  in  the  rest  of 
the  water,  but  if  you  draw  it  up  into  the  air  then  it  will  acquire  weight, 
and  if  you  draw  the  air  under  the  water  then  the  water  on  finding 
itself  above  this  air  acquires  weight,  which  weight  it  cannot  support 
of  itself,  and  consequently  its  descent  is  inevitable,  and  therefore  it  falls 
into  the  water,  at  the  very  spot  which  had  been  left  a  vacuum  by  this 
water.  The  same  thing  would  happen  to  a  spirit  if  it  were  among  the 
elements,  for  it  would  continually  create  a  vacuum  in  whatsoever  ele- 
ment it  chanced  to  find  itself;  and  for  this  reason  it  would  be  neces-

sarily  in  perpetual  flight  towards  the  sky  until  it  had  passed  out  of  these 
elements. 

WHETHER  THE  SPIRIT  HAS  A  BODY  AMONG  THE  ELEMENTS 

We  have  proved  how  the  spirit  cannot  of  itself  exist  among  the 
elements  without  a  body,  nor  yet  move  of  itself  by  voluntary  move- 
ment except  to  rise  upwards.  We  now  proceed  to  say  that  such  a  spirit 
in  taking  a  body  of  air  must  of  necessity  spread  itself  through  this  air; 
for  if  it  remained  united,  it  would  be  separated  from  it  and  would  fall, 
and  so  create  a  vacuum,  as  is  said  above;  and  therefore  it  is  necessary, 
if  it  is  to  be  able  to  remain  suspended  in  the  air,  that  it  should  spread 
itself  over  a  certain  quantity  of  air;  and  if  it  becomes  mingled  with  the 
air  two  difficulties  ensue,  namely  that  it  rarefies  that  quantity  of  air 
within  which  it  is  mingled,  and  consequently  this  air,  becoming  rare- 
fied, flies  upwards  of  its  own  accord,  and  will  not  remain  among  the 
air  that  is  heavier  than  itself;  and  moreover,  that  as  this  aetherial  es- 
sence is  spread  out,  the  parts  of  it  become  separated,  and  its  nature 
becomes  modified,  and  it  thereby  loses  something  of  its  former  power. 
To  these  there  is  also  added  a  third  difficulty,  and  that  is  that  this  body 
of  air  assumed  by  the  spirit  is  exposed  to  the  penetrating  force  of  the 
winds,  which  are  incessantly  severing  and  tearing  in  pieces  the  con- 
nected portions  of  the  air,  spinning  them  round  and  whirling  them 
amid  the  other  air;  and  therefore  the  spirit  which  was  spread  through 
this  air  would  be  dismembered  or  rent  in  pieces  and  broken,  together 
with  the  rending  in  pieces  of  the  air  within  which  it  was  spread. 

WHETHER  THE  SPIRIT  HAVING  ASSUMED  A  BODY  OF  AIR 
CAN  MOVE  OF  ITSELF  OR  NO 

It  is  impossible  that  the  spirit  diffused  within  a  quantity  of  air  can 
have  power  to  move  this  air;  and  this  is  shown  by  the  former  section 
in  which  it  is  stated  that  the  spirit  rarefies  that  quantity  of  air  within 
which  it  has  entered.  This  air  consequently  will  rise  up  above  the  other 
air,  and  this  will  be  a  movement  made  by  the  air  through  its  own 
levity,  and  not  through  the  voluntary  movement  of  the  spirit;  and  if 
this  air  meets  the  wind,  by  the  third  part  of  this  section  this  air  will  be 
moved  by  the  wind  and  not  by  the  spirit  which  is  diffused  within  it. 


148  ANATOMY 

WHETHER  THE  SPIRIT  CAN  SPEAK  OR  NO 

Wishing  to  prove  whether  or  no  the  spirit  can  speak,  it  is  necessary 
first  to  define  what  voice  is,  and  how  it  is  produced,  and  we  may  de- 
fine it  as  follows: — the  voice  is  movement  of  air  in  friction  against  a 
compact  body,  or  of  the  compact  body  in  friction  against  the  air,  which 
is  the  same  thing;  and  this  friction  of  compact  with  tenuous  substance 
condenses  the  latter,  and  so  makes  it  capable  of  resisting;  moreover,  the 
tenuous  substance,  when  in  swift  motion,  and  a  similar  substance 
moving  slowly,  condense  each  other  at  their  contact,  and  make  a  noise 
or  tremendous  uproar;  and  the  sound  or  murmur  caused  by  one  tenu- 
ous substance  moving  through  another  at  a  moderate  pace  [is]  like 
a  great  flame  which  creates  noises  within  the  air;  and  the  loudest 
uproar  made  by  one  tenuous  substance  with  another  is  when  the  one 
swiftly  moving  penetrates  the  other  which  is  unmoveable,  as  for  in- 
stance the  flame  of  fire  issuing  from  the  cloud,  which  strikes  the  air 
and  so  produces  thunderbolts. 

We  may  say  therefore,  that  the  spirit  cannot  produce  a  voice  without 
movement  of  air,  and  there  is  no  air  within  it,  and  it  cannot  expel  air 
from  itself  if  it  has  it  not,  and  if  it  wishes  to  move  that  within  which  it 
is  diffused  it  becomes  necessary  that  the  spirit  should  multiply  itself, 
and  this  it  cannot  do  unless  it  has  quantity.  And  by  the  fourth  part  it 
is  said  that  no  tenuous  body  can  move  unless  it  has  a  fixed  spot  from 
whence  to  take  its  motion,  and  especially  in  the  case  of  an  element 
moving  in  its  own  element,  which  does  not  move  of  itself,  except  by 
uniform  evaporation  at  the  centre  of  the  thing  evaporated,  as  happens 
with  a  sponge  squeezed  in  the  hand,  which  is  held  under  water,  since 
the  water  flows  away  from  it  in  every  direction  with  equal  movement 
through  the  openings  that  come  between  the  fingers  of  the  hand  within 
which  it  is  squeezed.

manner  the  reversive  nerves  communicate  sensation  to  the  rings  of  the

The  reversive  nerves  start  in  a  b,  and  b  f  is  the  reversive  nerve  that 
descends  to  the  door-keeper  of  the  stomach,  and  its  companion  the  left 
nerve  descends  to  the  case  that  encloses  the  heart,  and  I  believe  this  to 
be  the  nerve  that  enters  into  the  heart. 

[The  heart  a  muscle  nourished  li\e  the  others  by  arteries  and  veins] 
The  heart  in  itself  is  not  the  beginning  of  life;  but  it  is  a  vessel 
formed  of  thick  muscle,  vivified  and  nourished  by  the  artery  and  vein 
as  are  the  other  muscles.  True  it  is  that  the  blood  and  the  artery 
which  purges  itself  in  it  are  the  life  and  nutriment  of  the  other 
muscles,  and  it  is  of  such  density  that  fire  can  hardly  injure  it;  and 
this  is  seen  in  the  case  of  men  who  have  been  burnt,  in  whom  after 
the  bones  have  been  burnt  to  cinders  the  heart  within  still  bleeds;  and 
nature  has  made  this  great  capacity  of  resistance  to  heat  so  that  it  may 
be  able  to  resist  the  great  heat  generated  in  the  left  side  of  the  heart  by 
means  of  the  blood  of  the  artery  which  becomes  attenuated  in  this 
ventricle. 

The  variation  of  the  voice  starts  from  the  dilatation  and  contraction 
of  the  rings  of  which  the  trachea  is  composed;  dilatation  which  is  pro- 
duced by  the  muscles  which  join  with  these  rings;  and  the  contraction 
is  produced  I  believe  by  itself  because  it  is  formed  of  cartilage  which 
bends  of  its  own  accord  in  order  to  return  to  the  shape  first  given  to  it.

[Origin  of  all  the  veins  of  the  gibbous  part  of  the  heart] 

The  root  of  all  the  veins  is  in  the  gibbous  part  of  the  heart,  that  is  of 
the  skin  of  the  blood;  and  this  is  manifest  because  there  it  is  thicker 
than  elsewhere,  and  goes  on  ramifying  an  infinite  number  of  times 
through  every  limb  of  the  creature.

I  Vdm  from  the  liver  to  the  spleen  and  their  junction] 

Of  the  two  thick  veins  which  go  from  the  liver  to  the  spleen,  which 
come  from  the  larger  veins  of  the  spine,  I  think  that  these  are  amasscrs 
of  the  superfluous  blood,  which  being  every  day  evacuated  by  the 
mcsaruic  veins  is  deposited  in  the  bowels,  causing  the  same  stench 
when  it  has  reached  there  that  arises  from  the  dead  in  the  sepulchres, 
and  that  is  the  stench  of  the  excrements.

gate  of  the  liver,  all  together,  and  then  each  by  itself  separately  in  three

The  nerves  start  from  the  last  membrane  which  clothes  the  brain 
and  the  spinal  marrow. 

e  n  nerves  are  the  optic  nerves  which  are  situated  below  the  nerves 
called  caruncular;  but  the  optic  serve  the  visual  faculty  and  the  carun-

You  will  take  to  pieces  the  substance  of  the  brain  as  far  as  the  con-

dura  mater  penetrates  the  basilar  bone,  with  the  nerves  clothed  by  it 
together  with  the  pia  mater;  and  this  knowledge  you  will  acquire 
with  certainty  whenever  by  diligence  you  raise  this  pia  mater  little  by

OF  THE  FOOD  WHICH  MAKES  CORRUPTION 

I  say  that  the  extremities  of  the  mesaraic  veins  which  attract  to  them- 
selves the  substance  of  the  food  enclosed  in  the  intestines  are  enlarged 
by  means  of  the  natural  heat  of  the  man,  because  the  heat  separates 
and  enlarges  and  the  cold  assembles  and  constricts;  but  this  would  not 
be  sufficient  if  to  this  heat  were  not  added  the  stench  formed  by  the  cor- 
ruption of  the  blood  returned  by  the  arteries  to  these  intestines,  which 
blood  acts  in  these  intestines  not  otherwise  than  it  does  in  bodies  that 
have  been  buried;  which  stench  enlarges  the  intestines  and  penetrates 
into  all  the  interstices  and  swells  and  puffs  out  the  bodies  in  the  shape 
of  casks;  and  if  you  should  say  that  this  stench  arose  from  the  heat 
in  the  bodies  this  would  not  be  found  to  be  the  case  with  the  inflated 
bodies  which  are  covered  with  snow,  and  the  power  of  the  stench  is 
much  more  active  and  multiplies  much  more  than  does  that  of  the 
heat.  Fogli  b  36  v. 

DEMONSTRATION  OF  THE  BLADDER  OF  THE  MAN 

[Reins,  ureters,  bladder  and  urethra] 

First  demonstration 
Of  these  three  demonstrations  of  bladders,  in  the  first  are  represented 
the  ureteral  pores  and  how  they  part  from  the  reins  L  h,  and  join  to- 
gether at  the  bladder  two  fingers  space  above  the  starting  point  of 
the  neck  of  this  bladder,  and  at  a  short  distance  on  the  inside  of  this 
meeting  point  these  pores  discharge  the  urine  into  the  bladder,  from 
p  b  into  n  f,  in  the  manner  that  is  shown  in  part  in  the  channel  5, 
whence  it  is  then  poured  through  the  pipe  of  the  penis  a  g. 


ANATOMY  153 

It  remains  for  me  in  this  case  to  represent  and  describe  the  position 
of  the  muscles  which  open  and  close  the  passage  of  the  urine  to  the 
mouth  of  the  neck  of  this  bladder. 

Second  demonstration 

In  the  second  demonstration  one  represents  the  four  ramifications 
namely  right  and  left  of  the  veins  that  feed  this  bladder,  and  the  right 
and  left  artery  which  gives  it  life,  that  is  spirits. 

And  the  vein  is  always  situated  above  the  artery. 

Third  demonstration 
In  the  third  demonstration  is  contained  how  the  vein  and  artery  sur- 
round the  beginning  of  the  ureteral  pore  m  n  in  the  position  n,  and 
there  is  shown  the  interlacing  of  the  ramification  of  the  vein  with  the 
ramification  of  the  artery. 

[Entry  of  the  urine  into  the  bladder] 

The  urine,  after  departing  from  the  kidneys,  penetrates  in  the 
ureteral  pores,  and  from  these  passes  into  the  bladder,  near  the  centre 
of  its  height,  entering  into  this  by  means  of  small  perforations  made 
transversely  between  one  coat  and  another;  and  this  slanting  perfora- 
tion was  not  made  because  nature  doubted  whether  this  urine  could 
return  to  the  kidneys,  because  this  is  impossible  by  the  fourth  [rule] 
concerning  channels  (de'  condotti)  where  it  is  stated: — 'the  water 
which  from  a  height  descends  by  a  thin  vein  and  penetrates  under  the 
bottom  of  the  sheet  of  water  cannot  be  compared  as  to  its  reflex  move- 
ment, unless  there  is  as  great  thickness  in  the  sheet  of  water  as  the 
thickness  of  the  descending  vein,  nor  any  greater  height  of  water  in 
this  than  the  depth  in  the  sheet  of  water.'  And  if  you  were  to  say  that 
the  more  the  bladder  fills  the  more  it  closes,  to  this  one  will  reply  that 
the  fact  of  such  perforations  being  pressed  together  by  the  urine  which 
closed  these  walls  would  prevent  the  entrance  of  the  rest  of  the  urine 
as  it  descends,  which  cannot  be  by  the  fourth  mentioned  previously, 
which  states  that  the  thin  raised-up  urine  is  more  potent  than  the  low 
and  wide  which  is  in  the  bladder.  Fogli  b  37  r.

[The  relation  of  the  lungs  to  the  bronchial  tubes] 

The  substance  of  the  lung  is  expansible  and  extendible,  and  it  is 
interposed  between  the  ramifications  of  the  trachea,  so  that  these  rami- 
fications may  not  be  dislodged  from  their  positions;  and  this  substance 
interposes  itself  between  this  ramification  and  the  ribs  of  the  chest, 
after  the  fashion  of  a  soft  feather  bed. 

Remember  to  represent  the  mediastinum  (heart  cavity)  with  the

[How  to  describe  the  thoracic  organs] 

Make  first  the  ramification  of  the  lung,  and  then  make  the  ramifica- 
tion of  the  heart,  that  is  of  its  veins  and  arteries;  afterwards  make  the 
third  ramification  of  the  mixture  of  the  one  ramification  with  the 
other;  and  these  mixtures  you  will  make  from  four  aspects,  and  you  will 
do  the  like  with  the  said  ramifications  which  will  be  twelve;  and  then 
make  a  view  of  each  from  above  and  one  from  below,  and  this  will 
make  in  all  eighteen  demonstrations. 

You  will  first  make  this  lung  in  its  entirety,  seen  from  four  aspects, 
in  its  entire  perfection;  afterwards  you  will  represent  it  so  that  it  is  seen 
perforated  merely  with  the  ramification  of  its  trachea  in  four  other 
aspects. 

After  you  have  done  this  do  the  same  in  the  demonstration  of  the

then  make  a  ramification  of  nerves  alone  from  four  aspects,  and  then 
weave  them  in  four  other  aspects  of  the  heart  and  lung  joined  together;

[Description  of  the  region  of  the  mouth} 

Here  the  lips  become  muscles,  moving  the  lateral  muscles  with  them- 
selves. 

And  then  the  lateral  muscles  move  the  lips. 

It  is  necessary  to  note  first  as  to  the  bones  of  the  face,  in  what  part 
arise  and  whence  come  the  nerves  which  first  open  and  then  close  the 
lips  of  the  mouth,  and  where  the  muscles  are  attached  which  are  pene- 
trated by  these  nerves. 

[Nerves  and  muscles  of  the  mouth  and  their  functions  in  various  move- 
ments] 

The  nerve  n  m  in  the  lower  lip  and  the  nerve  o  p  in  the  upper  lip 
are  the  cause  why  the  mouth  closes  with  the  help  of  the  muscles  of 
which  these  lips  of  the  mouth  are  formed. 

The  muscles  called  lips  of  the  mouth  as  they  become  compressed  to- 
wards their  centre  draw  the  lateral  muscles  after  them;  and  as  the 
lateral  muscles  draw  back  in  themselves,  contracting,  they  then  draw 
back  the  lips  of  the  mouth  and  so  this  mouth  expands. 

The  final  contraction  of  the  mouth  makes  it  equal  to  half  what  it  is 
when  it  is  at  its  greatest  extension,  and  it  is  the  same  with  regard  to  the 
greatest  breadth  of  the  nostrils  of  the  nose  and  of  the  interval  inter- 
posed between  the  tear-ducts  of  the  eyes. 

OF  THE  NERVES  WHICH  TIGHTEN  THE  LIPS 

The  movements  that  the  lips  make  as  they  tighten  are  two,  of  which 
one  is  that  which  presses  and  strains  the  one  lip  against  the  other,  the 
second  movement  is  that  which  compresses  or  shortens  the  length  of 
the  mouth ;  but  that  which  presses  the  one  lip  against  the  other  does  not 
proceed  beyond  the  last  molars  of  the  mouth,  and  these  when  they  are 
drawn  are  of  such  great  power  that,  keeping  the  teeth  somewhat  open, 


156  ANATOMY 

they  would  draw  the  lips  of  the  mouth  within  the  teeth,  as  is  shown  in 
the  mouth  g  h  which  is  drawn  by  the  muscles  r  by  its  sides. 

[Which  muscles  are  those  that  tighten  the  mouth  across?] 

The  muscles  that  tighten  the  mouth  across  as  is  shown  above  are  the 
lips  themselves,  which  draw  the  sides  of  the  mouth  towards  the  centre; 
and  this  is  shown  us  by  the  fourth  [rule]  of  this  which  says: — the  skin 
which  forms  the  covering  of  the  muscles  that  draw  always  points  with 
its  wrinkles  to  the  spot  where  is  the  cause  of  the  movement;  and  by 
the  fifth:  no  muscle  uses  its  power  in  pushing  but  always  in  drawing 
to  itself  the  parts  that  are  joined  to  it;  therefore  the  centre  of  the 
muscles  called  the  lips  of  the  mouth  draws  to  itself  the  extremities  of 
this  mouth  with  part  of  the  cheeks,  and  for  this  reason  the  mouth  in 
this  function  is  always  filled  with  wrinkles.  Fogli  b  38  v.

[How  nature  gives  animals  the  power  of  motion] 

ON  MACHINES 

Why  nature  cannot  give  the  power  of  movement  to  animals  without 
mechanical  instruments,  as  is  shown  by  me  in  this  book  on  the  works 
of  movement  which  nature  has  created  in  the  animals.  And  for  this 
reason  I  have  drawn  up  the  rules  of  the  four  powers  of  nature  with- 
out which  nothing  through  her  can  give  local  movement  to  these  ani- 
mals. We  shall  therefore  first  describe  this  local  movement  and  how  it 
produces  and  is  produced  by  each  of  the  other  three  powers.  Then  we 
shall  describe  the  natural  weight,  for  though  no  weight  can  be  said  to 
be  other  than  accidental,  it  has  pleased  us  to  style  it  thus  in  order  to 
distinguish  it  from  the  force  which  in  all  its  operations  is  of  the  nature 
of  weight  and  is  for  this  reason  called  accidental  weight,  and  this  is 
the  force  which  is  produced  by  the  third  power  of  nature,  that  is,  the 
inherent  or  natural  power.  The  fourth  and  last  power  will  be  called 
percussion,  that  is,  the  end  or  restraint  of  movement.  And  we  shall 


160  ANATOMY 

begin  by  stating  that  every  local  insensible  movement  is  produced  by  a 
sensible  mover,  just  as  in  a  clock  the  counterpoise  is  raised  up  by  man 
who  is  its  mover.  Moreover  the  elements  repel  or  attract  each  other, 
for  one  sees  water  expelling  air  from  itself,  and  fire  entering  as  heat 
under  the  bottom  of  a  boiler  and  afterwards  escaping  in  the  bubbles 
on  the  surface  of  the  boiling  water.  And  again  the  flame  draws  to 
itself  the  air,  and  the  heat  of  the  sun  draws  up  the  water  in  the  form

[Description  of  the  human  body  in  process  of  dissection] 
THE  ORDER  OF  THE  BOOK 

This  plan  of  mine  of  the  human  body  will  be  unfolded  to  you  just 
as  though  you  had  the  natural  man  before  you.  The  reason  is  that  if 
you  wish  to  know  thoroughly  the  parts  of  a  man  after  he  has  been  dis- 
sected you  must  either  turn  him  or  your  eye  so  that  you  are  examining 
from  different  aspects,  from  below,  from  above  and  from  the  sides, 
turning  him  over  and  studying  the  origin  of  each  limb;  and  in  such  a 
way  the  natural  anatomy  has  satisfied  your  desire  for  knowledge.  But 
you  must  understand  that  such  knowledge  as  this  will  not  continue  to 
satisfy  you  on  account  of  the  very  great  confusion  which  must  arise 
from  the  mixture  of  membranes  with  veins,  arteries,  nerves,  tendons, 
muscles,  bones  and  the  blood  which  of  itself  tinges  every  part  with  the 
same  colour,  the  veins  through  which  this  blood  is  discharged  not 
being  perceptible  by  reason  of  their  minuteness.  The  completeness  of 
the  membranes  is  broken  during  the  process  of  investigation  of  the 
parts  which  they  enclose,  and  the  fact  that  their  transparent  substance 
is  stained  with  blood  prevents  the  proper  identification  of  the  parts 
which  these  cover  on  account  of  the  similarity  of  the  blood-stained 
colour,  for  you  cannot  attain  to  any  knowledge  of  the  one  without 
confusing  and  destroying  the  other. 

Therefore  it  becomes  necessary  to  have  several  dissections:  you  will 
need  three  in  order  to  have  a  complete  knowledge  of  the  veins  and 
arteries,  destroying  all  the  rest  with  very  great  care;  and  three  others 
for  a  knowledge  of  the  membranes,  'panniculi',  three  for  the  tendons, 


ANATOMY  161 

muscles  and  ligaments,  three  for  the  bones  and  cartilages,  three  for  the 
anatomy  of  the  bones,  for  these  have  to  be  sawn  through  in  order  to 
show  which  are  hollow  and  which  not,  which  are  full  of  marrow, 
which  spongy,  which  thick  from  the  outside  inwards,  and  which  thin. 
And  some  have  great  thinness  at  one  part  and  thickness  at  another,  and 
at  another  part  they  are  hollow  or  filled  with  bone  or  full  of  marrow, 
or  spongy.  Thus  it  may  be  that  all  these  conditions  will  sometimes  be 
found  in  the  same  bone  and  there  may  be  another  bone  which  has 
none  of  them.  Three  also  must  be  devoted  to  the  female  body,  and  in 
this  there  is  a  great  mystery  by  reason  of  the  womb  and  its  foetus. 

Therefore  by  my  plan  you  will  become  acquainted  with  every  part 
and  every  whole  by  means  of  a  demonstration  of  each  part  from  three 
different  aspects;  for  when  you  have  seen  any  member  from  the  front 
with  the  nerves,  tendons  and  veins  which  have  their  origin  on  the 
opposite  side,  you  will  be  shown  the  same  member  either  from  a  side 
view  or  from  behind,  just  as  though  you  had  the  very  member  in  your 
hand  and  went  on  turning  it  from  side  to  side  until  you  had  a  full 
understanding  of  all  that  you  desire  to  know. 

And  so  in  like  manner  there  will  be  placed  before  you  three  or  four 
demonstrations  of  each  member  under  different  aspects,  so  that  you 
will  retain  a  true  and  complete  knowledge  of  all  that  you  wish  to  learn 
concerning  the  figure  of  man. 

Therefore  there  shall  be  revealed  to  you  here  in  fifteen  entire  figures 
the  cosmography  of  the  'minor  mondo'  (the  microcosmos  or  lesser 
world)  in  the  same  order  as  was  used  by  Ptolemy  before  me  in  his 
Cosmography.  And  therefore  I  shall  divide  the  members  as  he  divided 
the  whole,  into  provinces,  and  then  I  shall  define  the  functions  of  the 
parts  in  every  direction,  placing  before  your  eyes  the  perception  of  the 
whole  figure  and  capacity  of  man  in  so  far  as  it  has  local  movement  by 
means  of  its  parts. 

And  would  that  it  might  please  our  Creator  that  I  were  able  to 
reveal  the  nature  of  man  and  his  customs  even  as  I  describe  his  figure! 

And  I  would  remind  you  that  the  dissection  of  the  nerves  will  not 
reveal  to  you  the  position  of  their  ramification  nor  into  which  muscles 
they  ramify  by  means  of  bodies  dissected  either  in  flowing  water  or  in 
lime  water;  because,  although  the  origin  of  their  derivation  may  be 
discerned  without  the  use  of  the  water  as  well  as  with  it,  their  ramifica- 


ifo  ANATOMY 

tions  tend  to  unite  in  flowing  water  all  in  one  bunch  just  as  does  flax 
or  hemp  carded  for  spinning,  so  that  it  becomes  impossible  to  find  out 
again  into  which  muscles  the  nerves  are  distributed  or  with  which  or 
how  many  ramifications  they  enter  the  said  muscles. 


[Dissection  of  the  human  hand] 

OF  THE  HAND  FROM  WITHIN 

When  you  begin  the  hand  from  within  first  separate  all  the  bones 
a  little  from  each  other  so  that  you  may  be  able  quickly  to  recognise 
the  true  shape  of  each  bone  from  the  palmar  side  of  the  hand,  and 
also  the  real  number  and  position  of  each,  and  have  some  sawn 
through  down  the  centre  of  their  thickness,  that  is  lengthwise,  so  as  to 
show  which  is  empty  and  which  full.  And  having  done  this  place  the 
bones  together  at  their  true  contacts  and  represent  the  whole  hand  from 
within  wide  open.  Then  set  down  the  complete  figures  of  the  first 
ligaments  of  the  bones.  The  next  demonstration  should  be  of  the 
muscles  which  bind  together  the  wrist  and  the  remainder  of  the  hand. 
The  fifth  shall  represent  the  tendons  which  move  the  first  joints  of 
the  fingers.  The  sixth  the  tendons  which  move  the  second  joints  of 
the  fingers.  The  seventh  those  which  move  the  third  joints  of  these 
fingers.  The  eighth  shall  represent  the  nerves  which  give  them  the 
sense  of  touch.  The  ninth  the  veins  and  the  arteries.  The  tenth  shall 
show  the  whole  hand  complete  with  its  skin  and  its  measurements, 
and  measurements  should  also  be  made  of  the  bones.  And  whatever 
you  do  for  this  side  of  the  hand  you  should  do  the  same  for  the  other 
three  sides,  that  is  from  the  palmar  or  under  side,  from  the  dorsal  side 
and  from  the  sides  of  the  extensor  and  the  flexor  muscles. 

And  thus  in  the  chapter  on  the  hand  you  will  make  forty  demon- 
strations; and  you  should  do  the  same  with  each  member. 

And  in  this  way  you  will  attain  complete  knowledge. 

You  should  afterwards  make  a  discourse  concerning  the  hands  of 
each  of  the  animals,  in  order  to  show  in  what  way  they  vary,  as  with 
the  bear,  in  which  the  ligaments  of  the  tendons  of  the  toes  are  joined 
above  the  neck  of  the  foot.  Quaderni  i  2  r.

IF  THE  WIND  WHICH  ESCAPES  FROM  THE  TRACHEA 
CONDENSES  ITSELF  IN  ITS  TRANSIT  OR  NO 

All  the  air  that  enters  into  the  trachea  is  of  equal  quantity  in  all  the 
degrees  which  are  produced  by  its  ramification;  after  the  manner  of 
the  branches  born  during  the  seasonal  growth  of  the  plants  which  every 
year,  if  the  various  thicknesses  of  all  the  branches  that  have  been  pro- 
duced are  reckoned  together,  equal  the  thickness  of  the  stem  of  their 
plant. 

But  the  trachea  contracts  itself  in  the  larynx  in  order  to  condense  the 
air,  which  seems  a  thing  of  life  as  it  comes  from  the  lung  to  create  the 
various  kinds  of  voices,  and  also  to  press  and  dilate  the  different  pas- 
sages and  ventricles  of  the  brain,  because  if  the  trachea  were  thus 
dilated  at  its  upper  end  as  it  is  in  the  throat,  the  air  would  not  be 
able  to  condense  itself  and  perform  the  duties  and  benefits  which  are 
necessary  to  life  and  to  man,  that  is  in  speaking,  singing  and  the  like. 
And  the  wind  which  is  suddenly  expelled  from  the  lung  as  it  pro- 
duces the  deep  sighs  proceeds  by  the  help  of  the  wall  of  the  abdomen 
(mirac?)  which  squeezes  the  intestines,  and  they  raise  the  diaphragm 
that  presses  on  the  lung.  Quaderni  1  5  v. 

There  may  be  a  veiled  significance  in  the  use  of  the  word  'abbreviatori'  as  the  term 
was  also  applied  to  the  secretaries  at  the  Chancery  of  the  Vatican.  Leonardo  in  one  of  his 
letters  complains  of  having  been  impeded  in  his  anatomical  researches  as  a  result  of  in- 
formation laid  before  the  Pope. 


1 64  ANATOMY 

IF  THE  HEART  AT  ITS  DEATH  CHANGES  POSITION  OR  NO 

The  change  of  the  heart  at  its  death  is  similar  to  the  change  which 
it  undergoes  during  the  expulsion  of  its  blood,  and  is  somewhat  less. 
This  is  shown  when  one  sees  the  pigs  in  Tuscany,  where  they  pierce 
the  hearts  of  the  pigs  by  means  of  an  instrument  called  a  borer,  which 
is  used  for  drawing  wine  out  of  casks.  And  thus  turning  the  pig  over 
and  tying  it  up  well  they  pierce  its  right  side  and  its  heart  at  the  same 
time  with  the  borer,  thrusting  it  in  in  a  straight  line.  And  if  this  borer 
pierces  the  heart  when  it  is  distended  the  heart  as  it  expels  the  blood 
becomes  contracted  and  draws  the  wound  to  the  top  together  with  the 
point  of  the  borer;  and  the  more  it  raises  the  point  of  the  borer  within 
the  more  it  lowers  the  handle  of  the  borer  outside;  and  afterwards 
when  the  heart  is  distended  and  drives  this  wound  downwards  the 
part  of  this  borer  which  is  outside  makes  a  movement  that  is  the  op- 
posite to  that  of  the  part  within  which  moves  together  with  the  move- 
ment of  the  heart.  And  this  it  does  many  times,  so  that  at  the  end  of 
life  that  part  of  the  borer  that  is  outside  remains  in  the  middle  of  the 
two  extremities,  where  were  the  last  contrary  movements  of  the  heart 
when  it  was  alive.  And  when  the  heart  becomes  quite  cold  it  shrinks 
somewhat  and  contracts  as  much  as  it  had  extended  when  warm  be- 
cause heat  causes  a  body  to  increase  or  diminish  when  it  enters  into 
it  or  leaves  it;  and  this  I  have  seen  many  times  and  have  observed  such 
measurements  having  allowed  the  instrument  to  remain  in  the  heart 
until  the  animal  was  cut  up.  .  .  . 

And  from  the  greatest  to  the  smallest  movement  of  the  heart  of  this 
animal  is  about  the  thickness  of  a  finger,  and  at  the  end  the  heart 
remains  with  its  point  out  of  its  usual  position  by  about  half  the 
thickness  of  a  finger;  and  pay  attention  lest  you  make  a  mistake  in 
taking  this  measurement  because  sometimes  the  handle  of  this  borer 
will  not  make  any  change  whether  the  heart  is  living  or  dead;  and 
this  occurs  when  the  heart  receives  its  wound  half  way  in  the  process 
of  its  contracting,  in  which  position  it  remains  when  it  is  dead.  And 
sometimes  this  handle  makes  the  greater  change  and  this  occurs  when 
the  heart  receives  its  wound  during  its  period  of  greater  or  less  length, 
and  thus  it  will  make  as  many  varieties  of  distances  as  are  the  varia- 
tions in  the  length  or  shortness  of  the  heart  when  it  is  wounded.  More- 


ANATOMY  165 

pVCJ  this  handle  will  make  greater  or  less  changes  according  as  the 
point  of  the  borer  penetrates  further  or  less  into  the  heart;  for  if  the 
point  of  the  iron  transfixes  the  heart  it  makes  a  lesser  movement  from 
the  centre  of  its  movement,  that  is  from  the  place,  than  it  would  do  if 
the  iron  had  only  wounded  the  heart  in  the  front  part  of  its  anterior 
wall;  and  on  this  point  I  will  not  dwell  further  because  a  complete 
treatise  on  these  movements  has  been  compiled  in  the  twentieth  book 
on  the  forces  of  the  lever.  And  if  you  should  consider  that  when  the 
heart  had  been  transfixed  the  length  of  the  borer  could  not  follow  the 
movement  spoken  of  above  through  it  being  impeded  by  the  anterior 
wall  of  the  heart  you  must  understand  that  in  the  extension  and  dila- 
tion of  the  heart,  it  draws  or  drives  the  point  of  this  iron  along  with 
its  motion;  and  the  iron  which  finds  itself  in  the  anterior  wall  enlarges 
its  wound  both  upwards  and  downwards,  or  to  put  it  better  moves  it 
seeing  that  the  roundness  of  the  thick  part  of  the  iron  does  not  enlarge 
since  it  does  not  cut,  but  carries  with  it  the  front  wound  of  the  heart, 
compressing  the  part  of  the  heart  in  contact  with  it  now  from  the  up- 
per part  of  the  wound,  now  from  the  lower  part,  and  such  rarefac- 
tion and  compression  is  easily  made  by  this  heart  when  it  is  warm  be- 
cause it  is  less  dense.  Quaderni  1  6  r.

You  should  make  the  liver  in  the  embryo  differing  from  that  of

But  you  should  make  first  the  anatomy  of  the  hatched  eggs. 

Say  how  at  four  months  the  child  is  half  the  length  and  so  is  one 
eighth  the  weight  that  it  will  be  at  birth.

Do  this  demonstration  also  as  seen  from  the  side,  in  order  to  give

one  from  behind  in  order  to  give  information  as  to  the  veins  covered 
by  the  spine  and  by  the  heart  and  greater  veins. 

Your  order  shall  commence  with  the  formation  of  the  child  in  the 
womb,  saying  which  part  of  it  is  formed  first  and  so  on  in  succession, 
placing  its  parts  according  to  the  times  of  pregnancy  until  the  birth,

And  you  who  say  that  it  is  better  to  look  at  an  anatomical  demon- 
stration than  to  see  these  drawings,  you  would  be  right,  if  it  were  pos- 
sible to  observe  all  the  details  shown  in  these  drawings  in  a  single 
figure,  in  which,  with  all  your  ability,  you  will  not  see  nor  acquire  a 
knowledge  of  more  than  some  few  veins,  while,  in  order  to  obtain  an 
exact  and  complete  knowledge  of  these,  I  have  dissected  more  than  ten 
human  bodies,  destroying  all  the  various  members,  and  removing  even 
the  very  smallest  particles  of  the  flesh  which  surrounded  these  veins, 
without  causing  any  efTusion  of  blood  other  than  the  imperceptible 
bleeding  of  the  capillary  veins.  And  as  one  single  body  did  not  suffice 
for  so  long  a  time,  it  was  necessary  to  proceed  by  stages  with  so  many 
bodies  as  would  render  my  knowledge  complete;  and  this  I  repeated 
twice  over  in  order  to  discover  the  differences. 

But  though  possessed  of  an  interest  in  the  subject  you  may  perhaps 
be  deterred  by  natural  repugnance,  or,  if  this  does  not  restrain  you, 
then  perhaps  by  the  fear  of  passing  the  night  hours  in  the  company  of 
these  corpses,  quartered  and  flayed  and  horrible  to  behold;  and  if  this 
does  not  deter  you  then  perhaps  you  may  lack  the  skill  in  drawing 
essential  for  such  representation;  and  even  if  you  possess  this  skill  it 
may  not  be  combined  with  a  knowledge  of  perspective,  while,  if  it  is 
so  combined,  you  may  not  be  versed  in  the  methods  of  geometrical 
demonstration  or  the  method  of  estimating  the  forces  and  strength  of 
muscles,  or  perhaps  you  may  be  found  wanting  in  patience  so  that  you 
will  not  be  diligent. 

Concerning  which  things,  whether  or  no  they  have  all  been  found 
in  me,  the  hundred  and  twenty  books  which  I  have  composed  will  give 
their  verdict  'yes'  or  'no'.  In  these  I  have  not  been  hindered  either  by 
avarice  or  negligence  but  only  by  want  of  time.  Farewell.

For  lack  of  clue  knowledge  you  describe  it  so  confusedly  as  to  con

of  three  muscles,  that  is  of  three  pairs  of  muscles  which  are  opposite 
each  other,  so  that  the  bone  where  they  have  their  origin  may  not 
break. 

O  speculator  concerning  this  machine  of  ours  let  it  not  distress  you 
that  you  impart  knowledge  of  it  through  another's  death,  but  rejoice 
that  our  Creator  has  ordained  the  intellect  to  such  excellence  of  per-

Why  the  heart  does  not  beat  nor  the  lung  breathe  during  the  time 
that  the  child  is  in  the  womb  which  is  filled  with  water;  for  if  it  should 
draw  a  breath  it  would  instantly  be  drowned.  But  the  breathing  and 
the  beating  of  its  mother's  heart  works  in  the  life  of  the  child  which 
is  joined  to  her  by  means  of  the  umbilical  cord  as  it  works  in  the 
other  members. 

Therefore  during  every  harmonic  or  as  you  may  say  musical  tempo 
the  heart  makes  three  movements,  as  is  contained  below,  of  which 
tempos  an  hour  contains  one  thousand  and  eighty.  The  heart  therefore 
moves  three  thousand  five  hundred  and  forty  times  in  each  hour  in  the 
process  of  opening  and  shutting.  And  it  is  this  frequency  of  movement 
which  warms  the  thick  muscles  of  the  heart,  and  this  heat  warms  the 
blood  that  continually  beats  within  it.  It  heats  it  more  in  the  left 
ventricle,  where  the  walls  are  very  thick,  than  in  the  right  ventricle 
with  the  thin  wall.  And  this  heat  makes  the  blood  grow  thinner  and 
turns  it  to  vapour  and  changes  it  into  air,  and  would  change  it  to  ele- 
mental fire,  if  it  were  not  that  the  lung  renders  help  at  this  crisis  with 
the  coolness  of  its  air. 

But  the  lung  cannot  send  air  into  the  heart,  nor  is  this  necessary 
since,  as  has  been  said,  air  is  generated  in  the  heart,  and  this,  as  it  be- 
comes mingled  with  the  warm  thick  moisture,  evaporates  through  the 
extremities  of  the  capillary  veins  at  the  surface  of  the  skin  in  the  form 
of  perspiration;  and  moreover  the  air  which  is  breathed  in  by  the  lung, 
enters  continually  dry  and  cold,  and  issues  forth  moist  and  warm.  But 
the  arteries  which  are  joined  by  continual  contact  to  the  network  of 
branches  of  the  trachea,  spreading  through  the  lung,  are  what  catches 
the  coolness  of  the  air  as  it  enters  into  this  lung.        Quaderni  11  11  r.

mad:  thick  in  order  that  it  might  acquire  greater  weight,  so  that  it 
should  make  a  counterpoise  to  the  right  ventricle,  which  has  a  great 
weight  of  blood,  you  have  not  reflected  that  this  balancing  was  not 
necessary,  seeing  that  all  the  land  animals  except  man  have  the  heart 
in  a  recumbent  position;  and  the  heart  of  man  also  lies  thus  when  he  is 
lying  in  his  bed.  But  you  would  not  be  weighing  the  matter  well  in 
your  conclusion,  because  the  heart  has  two  supports  which  descend 
from  the  collar  bone,  from  which  by  the  fourth  of  'De  Ponderibus* 
the  heart  is  not  able  to  balance  itself,  if  there  is  not  a  single  support 
above,  and  these  two  supports  are  the  Arteria  Aorta  and  the  Vena 
cava;  and  furthermore  if  the  heart  is  deprived  of  the  weight  of  the 
blood  as  it  becomes  restricted  and  gives  it  in  deposit  to  its  upper  ven- 
tricles, the  centre  of  gravity  of  the  heart  would  then  be  on  the  right 
side  of  the  heart  and  thus  its  left  side  would  be  lightened.  But  this 
theory  of  balancing  is  not  a  true  one  as  was  said  above  because  the 
animals  which  lie  or  which  stand  on  four  feet  have  the  heart  lying  as 
they  are  themselves,  and  with  these  no  balancing  of  the  heart  is  sought. 
And  in  the  case  of  the  bat  which  when  it  sleeps  always  places  itself 
upside  down,  how  does  the  heart  balance  with  the  right  and  left

WHY  THE  PRINCIPAL  VALVES  OF  THE  RIGHT  VENTRICLE 

ARE  MADE  WITH  SO  LITTLE  MEMBRANE  AND 

SUCH  A  NETWORK  OF  CORDAE 

This  thing  was  ordained  by  nature  in  order  that  as  the  right  ven- 
tricle commences  to  shut,  the  escape  of  the  blood  from  its  huge  capacity 
should  not  suddenly  cease,  because  a  portion  of  that  blood  had  to  be 
given  to  the  lung,  and  it  would  not  be  given  if  the  valve  had  stopped 
the  exit.  But  this  ventricle  shut  itself  when  the  lung  had  received  its 
quantity  of  blood  and  so  [from]  the  right  ventricle  it  was  able  to  press 
through  the  pores  of  the  median  wall  into  the  left  [MS.  right]  ven- 
tricle; and  at  the  same  time  the  right  auricle  became  the  depositary  of 
the  excess  of  the  blood  which  it  passes  to  the  lung,  and  this  suddenly 
gives  it  to  the  opening  of  this  right  ventricle  restoring  itself  through 
the  blood  with  which  the  liver  supplies  it.

HOW  MUCH  BLOOD  IS  THE  LIVER  ABLE  TO  GIVE  IT 
THROUGH  THE  OPENING  OF  THE  HEART? 

It  restores  as  much  of  it  as  it  consumes;  that  is  a  minimum  part, 
because  in  an  hour  the  heart  opens  about  two  thousand  times.  There  is 
great  weight. 

The  right  ventricle  was  made  heavier  than  the  left  one  in  order  that 
the  heart  may  stand  in  a  slanting  direction;  and  when  the  blood  rises 
out  of  the  left  ventricle  and  lightens  it  this  blood  goes  from  it  towards 
the  left  side  with  the  centre  of  its  gravity  when  it  is  in  the  upper 
ventricles. 

The  heart  has  four  ventricles,  that  is  two  upper  ones  called  auricles 
of  the  heart,  and  two  lower  than  these  called  the  right  and  left 
ventricles.  Quaderni  n  17  v. 

[Definitions] 

Definition  of  the  instruments. 

Discourse  on  the  nerves,  muscles,  tendons,  'panniculi'  (membranes) 
and  ligaments. 

The  function  of  the  nerves  is  to  convey  sensation;  they  are  the  team 
of  drivers  of  the  soul,  for  they  have  their  origin  from  its  seat  and  com- 
mand the  muscles  so  that  they  move  the  members  at  the  consent  of  the 
will  of  this  soul. 

The  muscles  the  ministers  of  the  nerves  draw  to  themselves  the 
sinews  which  are  joined  to  these  members  in  a  similar  manner. 

The  tendons  are  mechanical  instruments  which  have  no  sensation  of 
themselves  but  carry  out  as  much  work  as  is  entrusted  to  them. 

The  membranes  (panniculi)  are  joined  to  the  flesh  being  interposed 
between  the  flesh  and  the  nerve,  and  most  frequently  they  are  joined 
to  the  cartilage. 

The  ligaments  are  joined  to  the  tendons  and  are  of  the  nature  of 
membranes  (panniculi)  which  bind  together  the  joints  of  the  bones 
and  are  converted  into  cartilage,  and  they  are  as  many  in  number  at 
every  joint  as  are  the  tendons  which  move  the  joint  and  as  are  the 
tendons  opposite  to  these  which  come  to  the  same  joint,  and  these 
ligaments  join  and  mingle  together,  helping  strengthening  and  con- 
necting one  with  another. 


ANATOMY  171 

The  cartilage  is  a  hard  substance,  like,  let  us  say,  hardened  tendon 
or  softened  bone,  and  its  position  is  always  between  the  bone  and  the 
tendon  because  it  partakes  of  both  substances,  and  it  is  flexible  and 
unbreakable,  the  flexibility  acting  in  it  like  a  spring. 

Pellicles  are  certain  muscular  parts  which  are  made  up  of  flesh, 
tendons  and  nerves,  the  union  of  these  forming  a  composition  which 
is  capable  of  being  extended  in  any  direction;  flesh  is  a  mixture  made 
up  of  muscles,  tendon,  nerve,  blood  and  artery. 

Bone  is  a  hardness,  inflexible,  adapted  for  resistance,  and  is  without 
sensation  and  terminates  in  the  cartilages  which  form  its  extremities; 
and  its  marrow  is  composed  of  sponge,  blood,  and,  soft  fat  coated  over 
with  a  very  thin  tissue.  The  sponge-like  substance  is  a  mixture  of  bone, 
fat  and  blood. 

The  membranes  (panniculi)  are  of  three  kinds,  that  is,  made  up  of 
tendons,  made  up  of  nerves,  and  made  up  of  nerves  and  tendons;  and 
the  mixed  membrane  is  woven  of  tendon,  nerve,  muscle,  vein  and 
artery. 

The  membranes  that  are  between  the  tendons  and  the  cartilages  are 
so  formed  as  to  unite  tendon  with  cartilage  in  a  large  and  continuous 
joint  so  that  it  may  not  break  through  excess  of  force;  and  when  the 
muscle  itself  thickens  it  does  not  draw  to  itself  the  tendon  or  any 
member,  but  the  muscle  is  drawn  by  the  tendon  towards  the  mem- 
brane and  the  cartilage,  as  happens  with  the  muscles  inside  the  ven- 
tricles of  the  heart  when  they  shut  their  openings.  But  the  muscles  of 
the  other  members  are  drawn  towards  the  bone  where  they  are  joined, 
and  draw  their  tendon  behind  them  together  with  the  member  that  is 
joined  to  this  tendon.

In  the  case  of  this  child  the  heart  does  not  beat  and  it  does  not 
breathe  because  it  lies  continually  in  water.  And  if  it  were  to  breathe  it 
would  be  drowned,  and  breathing  is  not  necessary  to  it  because  it 
receives  life  and  is  nourished  from  the  life  and  food  of  the  mother. 
And  this  food  nourishes  such  creature  in  just  the  same  way  as  it  does 
the  other  parts  of  the  mother,  namely  the  hands  feet  and  other  mem- 
bers. And  a  single  soul  governs  these  two  bodies,  and  the  desires  and 
fears  and  pains  are  common  to  this  creature  as  to  all  the  other  ani- 
mated members.  And  from  this  it  proceeds  that  a  thing  desired  by  the 
mother  is  often  found  engraved  upon  those  parts  of  the  child  which 
the  mother  keeps  in  herself  at  the  time  of  such  desire;  and  a  sudden 
fear  kills  both  mother  and  child. 

We  conclude  therefore  that  a  single  soul  governs  the  bodies  and 
nourishes  the  two  [bodies].  Quaderni  in  8  r.

pains  and  desires  of  the  child  which  is  in  the  body  of  the  mother,  in 
like  manner  the  nourishment  of  the  food  serves  for  the  child  and  it  is 
nourished  from  the  same  cause  as  the  other  members  of  the  mother, 
and  its  vital  powers  are  derived  from  the  air  which  is  the  common 
living  principle  of  the  human  race  and  of  other  living  things.

This  is  the  lung  in  its  case. 

The  question  arises  where  the  lung  becomes  cooler  or  more  heated, 
and  the  same  is  searched  for  in  the  heart. 

It  has  to  be  ascertained  whether  the  wall  of  the  heart  interposed 
between  its  two  ventricles  is  thinner  or  thicker  as  the  heart  becomes 
longer  or  shorter,  or  one  may  say  as  it  expands  or  contracts. 

It  is  our  opinion  that  during  the  process  of  dilation  it  increases  its 
capacity  and  the  right  ventricle  draws  blood  from  the  liver  and  the  left 
ventricle  at  such  time  draws  blood  from  the  right  one.

Follow  up  the  reversive  nerves  as  far  as  the  heart,  and  observe 
whether  these  nerves  give  movement  to  the  heart  or  whether  the  heart 
moves  of  itself.  And  if  its  movement  comes  from  the  reversive  nerves 
which  have  their  origin  in  the  brain  then  you  will  make  it  clear  how 
the  soul  has  its  seat  in  the  ventricles  of  the  brain,  and  the  vital  powers 
derive  their  origin  from  the  left  ventricle  of  the  heart.  And  if  this 


ANATOMY  175 

movement  of  the  heart  originates  in  itself  then  you  will  say  that  the 
scat  of  the  soul  is  in  the  heart  and  likewise  that  of  the  vital  powers,  so 
that  you  should  attend  well  to  these  reversive  nerves  and  similarly  to 
the  other  nerves,  because  the  movement  of  all  the  muscles  springs  from 
these  nerves  which  with  their  ramifications  pour  themselves  into  these 
muscles.  Many  are  the  times  when  the  heart  draws  into  itself  some  of 
the  air  which  it  finds  in  the  lung,  and  returns  it  after  it  is  heated 
without  this  lung  having  gathered  other  air  from  outside. 

It  is  proved  that  it  must  of  necessity  be  as  is  here  set  forth,  and  this 
is  that  the  heart  which  moves  of  itself  only  moves  in  opening  and 
shutting  itself;  this  opening  and  shutting  creates  motion  along  the 
line  that  lies  between  the  cusp  and  the  base  or  corona  of  the  heart; 
and  it  cannot  open  without  drawing  into  itself  air  from  the  lung, 
which  it  immediately  blows  out  again  into  the  lung,  where  it  will 
afterwards  be  seen  that  this  lung  will  be  restored  by  a  vigorous  move- 
ment of  sudden  deep  breathing  from  the  new  refreshment  of  cold  air; 
and  this  occurs  when  a  fixed  purpose  of  the  mind  banishes  into  ob- 
livion the  respiration  of  the  breath. 

In  closing  itself  the  heart  with  its  nerves  and  muscles  draws  behind 
it  the  powerful  vessels  which  proceed  from  the  heart  to  unite  with  the 
lung;  and  this  is  the  principal  cause  of  the  opening  of  the  lung,  because 
it  cannot  open  unless  the  vacuum  increases,  and  the  vacuum  cannot 
acquire  any  increase  unless  it  refills  itself,  and  finding  the  air  more 
suitable  for  this  restoration  of  the  vacuum  it  refills  itself  with  it.  This 
heart  afterwards  as  it  contracts  comes  to  reopen  itself,  and  as  it  reopens 
itself  it  relaxes  the  drawn-out  nerves  and  vessels  of  the  lung,  from 
which  it  follows  that  the  lung  closes  itself  up  again  and  at  the  same 
time  restores  the  increase  in  the  vacuum  of  the  heart  through  the  wind 
which  it  blows  out  of  itself,  and  in  part  sends  out  of  the  mouth  the 
superfluous  air  for  which  neither  in  it  nor  in  the  heart  is  there  any 
capacity.  Quaderni  iv  7  r.

The  two  tonsils  are  formed  on  the  opposite  sides  of  the  base  of  the

the  bone  of  the  maxilla  and  the  base  of  the  tongue  so  as  to  create  a 
space  between  the  two,  so  that  on  one  side  it  may  be  capable  of  receiv-

This  is  the  reverse  of  the  tongue  [drawing],  and  its  surface  is  rough

panthers,  leopards,  lynxes,  cats  and  the  like  which  have  the  surface  of 
their  tongues  very  rough  as  though  they  were  covered  with  very  small 
nails,  somewhat  flexible;  and  when  they  lick  their  skin  these  nails 
penetrate  down  to  the  roots  of  the  hairs,  and  after  the  fashion  of  combs 
they  carry  away  the  minute  animals  which  feed  upon  them. 

And  I  once  saw  how  a  lamb  was  licked  by  a  lion  in  our  city  of 
Florence,  where  there  are  always  from  twenty  five  to  thirty  of  them 
and  they  bear  young.  With  a  few  strokes  of  his  tongue  the  lion 
stripped  off  the  whole  fleece  with  which  the  lamb  was  covered,  and 
having  thus  made  it  bare  he  ate  it;  and  the  tongues  of  the  bovine 
species  are  also  rough.  Quaderni  iv  9  v. 

[Pronunciation  of  vowels] 

The  membrane  interposed  between  the  passage  that  the  air  makes  in 
part  through  the  nose  and  in  part  through  the  mouth  is  the  only  one 
which  man  uses  in  order  to  pronounce  the  letter  a,  that  is  the  mem- 
brane a  n,  and  though  the  tongue  and  lips  may  do  what  they  can,  this 
will  never  prevent  the  air  which  streams  out  from  the  trachea  from 
forming  the  sound  a  while  in  this  concavity  a  n.  Moreover  u  is  formed 
at  the  same  place  with  the  help  of  the  lips  which  tighten  and  thrust 


ANATOMY  177 

themselves  out  a  little;  and  the  more  these  lips  thrust  themselves  out 
the  better  do  they  pronounce  the  letter  u.  True  it  is  that  the  epiglottis 
m  rises  somewhat  towards  the  palate. 

And  if  it  were  not  for  it  doing  thus,  the  u  would  be  changed  into 
o,  and  this  o  .  .  . 

And  whether  when  a  o  u  are  pronounced  distinctly  and  rapidly  it  is 
necessary  that  in  pronouncing  them  continuously  without  any  interval 
of  time  the  opening  of  the  lips  should  go  on  continually  contracting, 
that  is  that  in  pronouncing  a  they  should  be  wide  apart,  closer  to- 
gether in  pronouncing  o  and  much  closer  still  in  pronouncing  u. 

It  is  proved  how  all  the  vowels  are  pronounced  with  the  back  part 
of  the  movable  palate  which  covers  the  epiglottis;  and  moreover  such 
pronunciation  comes  from  the  position  of  the  lips  by  means  of  which 
a  passage  is  formed  for  the  air  as  it  streams  out  carrying  with  it  the 
created  sound  of  the  voice,  which  even  when  the  lips  are  closed  streams 
out  through  the  nostrils,  but  when  issuing  through  such  passage  will 
never  become  a  demonstrator  of  any  of  these  letters. 

From  such  an  experiment  one  may  conclude  with  certainty  that  the 
trachea  does  not  create  any  sound  of  vowel  but  that  its  office  only 
extends  to  the  creation  of  the  aforesaid  voice  and  especially  in  a  o  u. 

[The  muscles  of  the  tongue] 

The  tongue  is  found  to  have  twenty-four  muscles  which  correspond 
to  the  six  muscles  of  which  the  mass  of  the  tongue  which  moves  in  the 
mouth  is  composed. 

The  present  task  is  to  discover  in  what  way  these  twenty-four  mus- 
cles are  divided  or  apportioned  in  the  service  of  the  tongue  in  its 
necessary  movements,  which  are  many  and  varied;  and  in  addition  to 
this  it  has  to  be  seen  in  what  manner  the  nerves  descend  to  it  from  the 
base  of  the  brain,  and  in  what  manner  they  pass  into  this  tongue  dis- 
tributing themselves  and  breaking  into  ramifications.  And  it  must 
further  be  noted  how  and  in  what  manner  the  said  twenty-four  mus- 
cles convert  themselves  into  six  in  the  formation  they  make  in  the 
tongue.  And  furthermore  you  should  show  whence  these  muscles  have 
their  origin,  that  is  in  the  vertebrae  of  the  neck  at  the  contact  with  the 
oesophagus,  and  some  in  the  maxilla  on  the  inside,  and  some  on  the 
trachea  on  the  outside  and  laterally.  And  similarly  how  the  veins 


178  ANATOMY 

nourish  them  and  how  the  arteries  give  them  the  spiritus,  (and  how 
the  nerves  give  them  sensation). 

Moreover  you  shall  describe  and  represent  in  what  way  the  proce- 
dure of  varying  and  modulating  and  articulating  the  voice  in  singing 
is  a  simple  function  of  the  rings  of  the  trachea  moved  by  the  reversive 
nerves,  and  in  this  case  no  part  of  the  tongue  is  used. 

And  this  is  proved  by  what  I  have  proved  before,  that  the  pipes  of 
the  organ  do  not  become  deeper  or  sharper  through  the  change  of  the 
fistula  (that  is  that  place  in  which  the  voice  is  produced),  in  making  it 
wider  or  narrower;  but  only  through  the  change  of  the  pipe  to  be  wide 
or  narrow  or  long  or  short  as  is  seen  in  the  expansion  or  compression 
of  the  winding  trumpet,  and  also  in  the  pipe  which  is  of  fixed  width 
or  length,  the  sound  varies  according  as  the  wind  is  let  into  it  with 
greater  or  less  impetus.  And  this  amount  of  variation  is  not  found  in 
the  case  of  objects  struck  with  a  greater  or  less  blow,  as  is  perceived 
when  bells  are  struck  by  very  small  or  very  large  clappers;  and  the 
same  thing  occurs  with  pieces  of  artillery  similar  in  width  but  differing 
in  length,  but  in  this  case  the  shorter  piece  makes  a  louder  and  deeper 
noise  than  the  longer  one.  And  I  do  not  go  into  this  at  greater  length 
because  it  is  fully  treated  in  the  book  about  harmonical  instruments. 
And  for  this  reason  I  will  resume  my  discourse  concerning  the  func- 
tions of  the  tongue  where  I  left  it. 

The  tongue  works  in  the  pronunciation  and  articulation  of  the  syl- 
lables which  are  the  constituent  parts  of  all  words.  This  tongue  is  also 
employed  during  the  necessary  revolutions  of  the  food  in  the  process 
of  mastication  and  in  the  cleansing  therefrom  of  the  inside  of  the 
mouth  together  with  the  teeth.  Its  principal  movements  are  seven; 
namely  stretching  out,  drawing  together  and  drawing  back,  thicken- 
ing, shortening,  spreading  out  and  pointing;  and  of  these  seven  move- 
ments three  are  composite  because  one  cannot  be  created  without 
another  also  being  created  joined  to  it  of  necessity;  and  this  is  the  case 
with  the  first  and  the  second,  that  is  with  stretching  out  and  drawing 
together,  for  you  cannot  stretch  out  a  substance  which  is  capable  of 
being  expanded  without  it  contracting  and  straightening  itself  on  all 
its  sides.  And  a  similar  result  occurs  in  the  third  and  fourth  move- 
ments which  are  contrary  to  the  two  first,  that  is  in  the  thickening  and 
shortening. 


ANATOMY  179 

Alter  these  come  the  fifth  and  sixth  movements  which  together  form 
its  third  movement  made  up  of  three  movements,  namely  spreading 
1  iiit  pointing  and  shortening. 

Although  human  subtlety  makes  a  variety  of  inventions  answering 
by  different  means  to  the  same  end,  it  will  never  devise  an  invention 
more  beautiful  more  simple  or  more  direct  than  does  nature,  because 
in  her  inventions  nothing  is  lacking,  and  nothing  is  superfluous;  and 
she  needs  no  countervailing  weights  when  she  creates  limbs  fitted  for 
movement  in  the  bodies  of  the  animals,  but  puts  within  them  the  soul 
of  the  body  which  forms  them,  that  is  the  soul  of  the  mother  which 
first  constructs  within  the  womb  the  shape  of  the  man,  and  in  due 
time  awakens  the  soul  that  is  to  be  its  inhabitant.  For  this  at  first  re- 
mained asleep,  in  the  guardianship  of  the  soul  of  the  mother,  who 
nourishes  and  gives  it  life  through  the  umbilical  vein,  with  all  its 
spiritual  members;  and  so  it  will  continue  for  such  time  as  the  said 
umbilical  cord  is  joined  to  it  by  the  secundines  and  the  cotyledons  by 
which  the  child  is  attached  to  the  mother.  And  this  is  the  reason  why 
any  wish  or  intense  desire  or  fright  experienced  by  the  mother,  or  any 
other  mental  suffering,  is  felt  more  powerfully  by  the  child  than  by 
the  mother,  for  there  are  many  cases  in  which  the  child  loses  its  life 
from  it. 

This  discourse  does  not  properly  belong  here,  but  is  necessary  in 
treating  of  the  structure  of  animated  bodies;  and  the  rest  of  the  defini- 
tion of  the  soul  I  leave  to  the  wisdom  of  the  friars,  those  fathers  of  the 
people  who  by  inspiration  know  all  mysteries.  I  speak  not  against  the 
sacred  books,  for  they  are  supreme  truth.  Quaderni  iv  10  r. 

HERE  FOLLOWS  [CONCERNING]  THE  ARTICULATION  OF 
THE  HUMAN  VOICE 

The  extension  and  restriction  of  the  trachea  together  with  its  dilation 
and  contraction  are  the  cause  of  the  variation  of  the  voice  of  the  ani- 
mals from  high  to  deep  and  from  deep  to  high;  and  as  regards  the 
second  of  these  actions,  as  the  shortening  of  the  trachea  is  not  sufficient 
when  the  voice  is  raised  it  dilates  itself  somewhat  towards  the  top 
part,  which  does  not  receive  any  degree  of  sound  but  produces  a  rais- 
ing of  the  voice  of  this  remnant  of  the  shortened  pipe.  But  of  this  we 


i8o  ANATOMY 

.shall  make  an  experiment  in  the  anatomy  of  the  animals,  by  pumping 
air  into  their  lungs  and  compressing  them,  and  so  narrowing  and  di- 
lating the  fistula  which  produces  their  voice.  Quaderni  iv  10  v. 

Here  is  a  doubt  as  to  the  pannicles  which  close  up  the  blood  in  the 
antechamber  of  the  heart  that  is  in  the  base  of  the  aorta,  whether 
nature  could  have  dispensed  with  them  or  no,  since  one  may  clearly 
see  how  the  three  walls  or  hinges  where  such  pannicular  valves  of  the 
heart  are  established,  are  those  which  by  their  swelling  shut  this  blood 
out  from  the  heart  when  the  heart  reopens  on  the  side  below  these 
valves. 

And  this  last  closing  nature  carries  out  in  order  that  the  great  force 
which  the  heart  employs  in  this  left  ventricle,  as  it  reopens  in  order  to 
draw  into  itself  the  blood  that  percolates  through  the  narrow  interstices 
of  the  wall  that  divides  it  from  the  left  ventricle,  should  not  for  the 
restoring  of  the  vacuum  be  obliged  to  draw  with  it  the  most  delicate 
pannicles  of  the  said  valves  of  the  heart. 

The  revolution  of  the  blood  in  the  antechamber  of  the  heart,  the 
base  of  the  aorta,  serves  two  effects,  of  which  the  first  is  that  this  revo- 
lution multiplied  in  many  aspects  causes  great  friction  in  itself,  and 
this  heats  and  lightens  the  blood  and  increases  and  vivifies  the  spiritus 
vitales  which  always  maintain  themselves  in  warmth  and  moisture. 
The  second  effect  of  this  revolution  of  the  blood  is  to  close  up  again 
the  opened  gates  of  the  heart  with  a  complete  system  of  fastening 
with  its  first  reflex  movement. 

As  many  as  are  the  times  which  this  gate  expels  the  blood  so  many 
are  those  which  the  heart  beats,  and  for  this  reason  those  who  are 
feverish  become  inflamed.  Quaderni  iv  n  r. 

Between  the  cords  (cordae)  and  threads  of  the  muscles  of  the  right 
ventricle  there  are  interwoven  a  quantity  of  minute  threads  of  the  na- 
ture and  shape  of  the  minute  muscles  which  form  the  worm  in  the 
brain  and  of  those  which  weave  the  rete  mirabile;  and  these  wind 
themselves  round  the  most  minute  and  imperceptible  nerves  and  weave 
themselves  with  them.  And  these  muscles  are  in  themselves  very  ca- 
pable of  expansion  and  contraction,  and  they  are  situated  within  the 
fury  of  the  rush  of  the  blood,  which  passes  in  and  out  among  the 


ANATOMY  181 

minute  cords  of  the  muscles  before  they  are  converted  into  the  mem- 
branes  (pannicuii)  of  the  valves. 

Before  you  open  the  heart  inflate  the  ventricles  of  the  heart  com- 
mencing from  the  artery  of  the  aorta;  and  then  tie  them  up  and 
consider  their  size.  Afterwards  do  the  same  with  the  right  ventricle  or 
the  right  'orecchio';  and  by  so  doing  you  will  see  its  shape  and  its  pur- 
pose, for  it  was  created  in  order  to  expand  and  contract  and  so  cause 
the  blood  to  revolve  as  it  passes  through  its  cells  which  are  full  of  tor- 
tuous passages  divided  by  rounded  walls  without  any  angles,  in  order 
that  the  motion  of  the  blood  not  finding  any  angular  obstructions  may 
have  an  easier  revolution  in  its  eddying  course.  And  thus  it  comes  to 
warm  itself  with  so  much  more  heat  in  proportion  as  the  movement  of 
the  heart  is  the  more  rapid.  So  it  sometimes  attains  to  such  great  heat 
that  the  heart  is  suffocated;  and  I  have  already  seen  one  case  where  it 
was  burst  as  a  man  was  fleeing  before  his  enemies,  and  he  poured  out 
perspiration  mingled  with  blood  through  all  the  pores  of  his  skin;  and 
this  heat  forms  the  spiritus  vitales.  And  thus  heat  gives  life  to  all  things; 
as  one  sees  the  heat  of  the  hen  or  of  the  turkey-hen  giving  life  and 
growth  to  the  chickens,  and  as  the  sun  in  returning  causes  all  the 
fruits  to  blossom  and  burgeon.  Quaderni  iv  13  r. 

[Division  of  surface  of  heart  by  vessels.  Peeling  the  flesh  off  to  find  cer- 
tain vessels} 

The  heart  has  its  surface  divided  into  three  parts  by  three  veins  which 
descend  from  its  base,  of  which  veins  two  terminate  the  extremities  of 
the  right  ventricle  and  have  two  arteries  in  contact  below  them.  As 
regards  the  third  vein  I  have  not  yet  seen  whether  it  has  an  artery  with 
it,  and  consequently  I  am  about  to  remove  some  of  the  flesh  of  the 
surface  in  order  to  satisfy  myself.  But  the  surface  space  of  the  heart 
enclosed  within  its  arteries  occupies  half  the  surface  circle  of  the  thick- 
ness of  the  heart  and  forms  the  outer  wall  of  the  right  ventricle.

efficacy  of  the  ventricles  of  the  heart,  which  receive  and  expel  the  blood 
from  their  cavities  and  other  passages,  as  made  only  in  order  to  heat 


182  ANATOMY 

and  refine  the  blood  and  make  it  more  suitable  for  penetrating  the  wall 
through  which  it  passes  from  the  right  to  the  left  ventricle,  where  by 
means  of  the  thickness  of  its  wall,  that  is  of  that  of  the  left  ventricle,  it 
conserves  the  heat  which  this  blood  brings  to  it.       Quaderni  iv  13  v.

four  sides,  and  to  place  them  as  they  are  in  nature  and  to  speak  about 

their  functions. 
The  immediate  causes  of  the  movements  of  the  legs  are  entirely 

separated  from  the  immediate  cause  of  the  movement  of  the  thigh,  and 

this  is  what  makes  the  power. 

[Of  the  muscles] 

When  you  have  finished  the  bones  of  the  legs  put  the  number  of  all 
the  bones,  and  at  the  end  of  the  tendons  set  down  the  number  of  these 
tendons.  And  you  should  do  the  same  with  the  muscles,  the  sinews,  the 
veins  and  arteries,  saying: — the  thigh  has  so  many,  and  the  leg  so  many 
and  the  feet  so  many  and  the  toes  so  many;  and  then  you  should  say: — 


ANATOMY  183 

so  many  are  the  muscles  which  start  from  the  bones  and  end  in  the 
hones,  and  so  many  are  those  which  start  from  the  bones  and  end  in 
another  muscle;  and  in  this  way  you  describe  every  detail  of  each  limb, 
and  especially  as  regards  the  ramifications  made  by  certain  muscles  in 
producing  different  tendons. 

These  four  legs  should  be  on  one  and  the  same  sheet  of  paper  so  that 
you  may  be  the  better  able  to  understand  the  positions  of  the  muscles 
and  to  recognise  them  from  different  sides.  Quaderni  v  4  r.

that  nature  works  in  all  things  in  the  briefest  time  and  way  possible;

And  you  will  commence  on  the  right  intestine  but  you  will  make  the 
entry  on  the  left  side  at  the  colon.  But  first  of  all  you  must  remove  with

the  knee-joint  was  bent  and  become  fixed  under  the  knee-joint,  and  not

which  part  is  preserved  longer.

ON  PAINTING 

Which  muscles  are  those  which  stand  out  as  people  grow  old  or  in 
the  young  when  they  become  lean? 

Which  are  the  places  in  the  human  limbs  in  which  the  flesh  never 
increases  on  account  of  any  degree  of  fatness  or  diminishes  on  account 
of  any  degree  of  leanness. 

What  has  to  be  sought  for  in  this  question  will  be  found  in  all  the 
surface  joints  of  the  bones,  as  shoulder,  elbow,  joints  of  the  hands  and 
fingers,  hips,  knees,  ankles  and  toes  and  similar  things  which  shall  be 
spoken  of  in  their  places. 

The  greatest  thickness  which  the  limbs  acquire  is  in  the  part  of  the 
muscle  that  is  farthest  away  from  their  attachments. 

The  flesh  never  increases  upon  the  parts  of  the  bones  which  are  near 
the  surface  of  the  limbs. 

In  the  movement  of  man,  nature  has  placed  all  those  parts  in  front 
which  on  being  struck  cause  a  man  to  feel  pain;  so  it  is  felt  in  the  shins 
of  the  legs  and  in  the  forehead  and  nose.  And  this  is  ordained  for  man's 
preservation,  for  if  such  power  of  enduring  suffering  were  not  inherent 
in  these  limbs  the  numerous  blows  received  on  them  would  be  the 
cause  of  their  destruction.  Quaderni  vi  22  r. 

OF  THE  MOVEMENTS  OF  THE  FINGERS  OF  THE  HANDS 

The  movements  of  the  fingers  are  chiefly  those  of  extension  and 
bending.  Extension  and  bending  are  done  in  various  ways,  that  is 
sometimes  by  bending  all  in  one  piece  at  the  first  joint,  at  another  time 
by  bending  or  straightening  themselves  half  way  at  the  second  joint, 
and  at  another  time  by  bending  in  their  whole  length  and  at  the  same 
time  in  all  the  three  joints.  If  the  two  first  joints  are  prevented  from 
bending  the  third  joint  will  bend  more  readily  than  before,  but  it  can 
never  bend  of  itself  alone  if  the  other  joints  are  free,  but  all  the  three 
joints  must  bend.  In  addition  to  the  above-mentioned  movements  there 
are  four  other  diief  movements,  of  which  two  are  upwards  and  down- 
wards, and  the  two  others  go  from  side  to  side,  and  each  of  these  is 
produced  by  a  single  tendon.  From  these  there  follow  an  infinite  num- 
ber of  other  movements  made  always  with  two  tendons;  and  if  one  of 


186  ANATOMY 

these  tendons  does  not  function  properly  the  other  takes  its  place.  The 
tendons  are  made  thick  on  the  inside  of  the  finger  and  thin  on  the 
outside;  and  on  the  inside  they  are  attached  to  every  joint  but  not  on 
the  outside.  c.a.  99  v.  a 


OF  THE  MUSCLES 

Nature  has  provided  man  with  functional  muscles  which  draw  the 
sinews  and  these  are  able  to  move  the  limbs  according  to  the  will  and 
desire  of  the  common  sense,  after  the  manner  of  officials  stationed  by 
their  lord  through  various  provinces  and  cities  to  represent  and  carry 
out  his  will  in  these  places.  And  the  official  who  on  more  than  one 
occasion  has  carried  out  the  commission  given  him  by  the  mouth  of  his 
lord  will  then  himself  at  the  same  time  do  something  which  does  not 
proceed  from  the  will  of  the  lord.  So  one  often  sees  with  the  fingers 
how  after  having  with  utmost  docility  learnt  things  upon  an  instru- 
ment as  they  are  commanded  by  the  judgment  they  will  afterwards

becoming  conscious  of  it.  c.a.  119  v.  a

that  is  of  the  equality  of  movement,  if  the  eyes  observe  minutely  the

OF  THE  NERVES 

The  hand  that  holds  the  stone  within  it  when  it  is  struck  with  a

OF  THE  BLOOD  THAT  THERE  IS  IN  THE  CROWN  OF 
THE  HEAD 

It  would  seem  to  be  a  simple  proposition  that  if  anyone  should  break 
the  crown  of  a  man's  head  nothing  would  flow  forth  from  this  frac- 
ture except  such  blood  as  lay  between  its  edges.  In  fact  every  heavy 
thing  seeks  low  places;  blood  possesses  weight  and  it  appears  impossible 
that  of  itself  it  could  ever  rise  to  a  height  like  an  aerial  and  light  thing. 
And  if  you  wished  to  say  that  by  the  extension  that  the  lung  makes  in 
the  lake  of  blood,  when  this  lung  in  the  ingathering  of  the  breath  fills 
itself  with  air,  and  in  becoming  deflated  drives  from  the  lake  the  blood, 
which  escapes  into  the  veins  and  makes  them  increase  and  swell,  and 
that  it  is  this  swelling  which  causes  this  blood  to  flow  out  from  the 
above  named  fracture  of  the  crown  of  the  head,  this  opinion  is  at  once 
confuted  by  the  fact  that  the  veins  are  quite  capable  and  adapted  to 
serve  as  a  convenient  receptacle  for  the  increase  of  the  blood  without  it 
having  to  flow  out  by  the  fracture  of  the  head  as  though  deprived  of 
such  receptacle. 

WHY  THIS  BLOOD  ESCAPES  BY  THE  CROWN  OF  THE  HEAD 

The  spiritual  parts  have  power  to  move  and  to  carry  with  them  in 
their  course  the  material  parts.  We  see  that  fire  by  reason  of  its  spiritual 
heat  sends  out  of  the  chimney  amid  the  steam  and  smoke  matter  that 
has  body  and  weight,  as  is  seen  with  soot  which  if  you  burn  you  will 
see  reduced  to  ashes.  So  the  heat  that  is  mingled  with  the  blood  finding 
itself  evaporate  by  the  fracture  of  the  head  desiring  to  return  to  its 
element,  carries  in  its  company  the  blood  with  which  this  heat  is  in- 
fused and  intermingled.  The  reason  why  the  smoke  rises  up  with  such 
fury  and  carries  substances  with  it  is  that  as  the  fire  attaches  itself  to  the 
wood  it  is  nourished  and  fed  by  a  fine  moisture,  and  as  this  moisture 


188  ANATOMY 

becomes  thicker  than  can  be  consumed  by  the  heat  that  is  within  the 
fire,  the  fire  desires  to  return  to  its  element,  and  carries  the  heated 
vapours  with  it,  as  may  be  seen  if  you  distil  quicksilver  in  a  retort;  you 
will  see  that  when  this  silver  of  so  great  weight  is  mingled  with  the 
heat  of  the  fire  it  ascends  and  then  in  smoke  falls  down  again  into  the 
second  container  and  retakes  its  former  nature.        a  56  v.  and  57  r. 

Observe  how  the  shoulder  changes  with  all  the  movements  of  the 
arm,  moving  up  and  down,  inwards  and  outwards,  backwards  and 
forwards,  and  so  also  with  turning  movements  or  any  other  move- 
ments. And  do  the  same  with  the  neck  the  hands  and  feet  and  the 
chest  above  the  hips.  e    17   r. 

PAINTING 

O  painter  skilled  in  anatomy,  beware  lest  the  undue  prominence  of 
the  bones  sinews  and  muscles  cause  you  to  become  a  wooden  painter 
from  the  desire  to  make  your  nude  figures  reveal  all  their  emotions. 
And  if  you  wish  to  remedy  this  you  should  consider  in  what  way  the 
muscles  of  old  or  lean  persons  cover  or  clothe  the  bones,  and  further- 
more note  the  principle  on  which  these  same  muscles  fill  up  the  spaces 
of  the  surface  which  come  between  them,  and  which  are  the  muscles 
that  never  lose  their  prominence  in  any  degree  of  fatness  whatsoever, 
and  which  those  whereof  the  tendons  become  indistinguishable  at  the 
least  suggestion  of  it.  And  there  are  many  cases  when  several  muscles 
grow  to  look  one  from  the  increase  of  fat,  and  many  in  which  when 
any  one  becomes  lean  or  old  a  single  muscle  divides  into  several;  and  in 
this  treatise  all  their  peculiarities  shall  be  set  forth  each  in  its  place,  and 
especially  with  regard  to  the  spaces  that  come  between  the  joints  of 
each  limb.  Further  you  should  not  fail  to  observe  the  variations  of  the 
aforesaid  muscles  round  the  joints  of  the  limbs  of  any  animal,  due  to 
the  diversity  of  the  movements  of  each  limb;  for  on  no  side  of  these 
joints  does  the  indication  of  these  muscles  become  completely  lost  by 
reason  either  of  the  increase  or  diminution  of  the  flesh  of  which  these 
muscles  are  composed.

very  necessary  for  such  painters  and  sculptors  as  profess  to  be  masters.

The  heart  is  a  principal  muscle  in  respect  of  force,  and  it  is  much

base  to  the  point  of  the  heart,  and  the  position  of  the  muscles  which 
spring  from  the  point  of  the  heart  and  go  to  the  summit. 

The  auricles  of  the  heart  are  the  ante-chambers  of  this  heart  which 
receive  the  blood  from  the  heart  when  it  escapes  from  its  ventricle  from 
the  beginning  to  the  end  of  the  pressure,  for  unless  a  part  of  this  quan- 
tity of  blood  escaped  the  heart  would  not  be  able  to  shut.  c  1  v.

The  sinew  which  guides  the  leg  which  is  joined  to  the  kneecap  feels

The  muscle  which  acts  upon  the  angle  formed  by  the  thigh  at  its  junc- 
tion with  the  bust  has  less  difficulty  and  has  less  weight  to  raise  because 
it  does  not  have  the  weight  of  the  thigh;  and  besides  this  it  has  stronger 
muscles  because  they  are  those  which  form  the  buttocks.  l  27  v.

192  COMPARATIVE  ANATOMY 

[Organs  of  the  senses  in  man  as  compared  with  those  of  other  animals] 
I  have  found  in  the  constitution  of  the  human  body  that  as  among 
all  the  constitutions  of  the  animals  it  is  of  more  obtuse  and  blunt  sensi- 
bilities, so  it  is  formed  of  an  instrument  less  ingenious  and  of  parts  less 
capable  of  receiving  the  power  of  the  senses.  I  have  seen  in  the  leonine 
species  how  the  sense  of  smell  forming  part  of  the  substance  of  the 
brain  it  descends  in  a  very  large  receptacle  to  meet  the  sense  of  smell 
which  enters  among  a  great  number  of  cartilaginous  cells  with  many 
passages  that  go  to  meet  the  above-mentioned  brain. 

The  eyes  of  the  leonine  species  have  a  great  part  of  their  head  as 
their  receptacle,  so  that  the  optic  nerves  may  be  in  immediate  con- 
junction with  the  brain.  With  man  the  contrary  is  seen  to  be  the  case 
for  the  cavities  of  the  eyes  occupy  but  a  small  part  of  the  head,  and 
the  optic  nerves  are  thin  and  long  and  weak;  consequently  as  one  sees 
they  work  feebly  by  day  and  worse  by  night,  whereas  the  aforesaid 
animals  see  better  by  night  than  by  day;  and  the  sign  of  this  is  seen 
in  the  fact  that  they  hunt  their  prey  by  night  and  sleep  by  day  as  do 
also  the  nocturnal  birds. 

The  light  or  pupil  of  the  human  eye  as  it  expands  or  contracts  gains 
or  loses  the  half  of  its  size;  and  in  the  nocturnal  animals  its  increase 
or  decrease  is  more  than  a  hundred  times.  This  may  be  seen  in  the 
eye  of  the  owl  a  nocturnal  bird  by  bringing  a  lighted  torch  near  to  it, 
and  still  more  by  making  it  look  at  the  sun,  for  then  you  will  see  the 
pupil  which  once  occupied  the  whole  of  the  eye  diminished  to  the  size 
of  a  grain  of  millet,  and  by  this  diminution  it  becomes  equal  to  the 
pupil  of  the  eye  of  man  and  clear  shining  things  seem  the  same  colour 
to  it  as  they  appear  at  this  time  to  man,  and  as  much  more  as  the  brain 
of  this  creature  is  less  than  the  man's  brain :  from  which  it  comes  about 
that  as  the  pupil  increases  in  the  night  time  a  hundred  fold  more  than 
that  of  the  man  it  sees  a  hundred  times  as  much  light  as  the  man  does, 
in  such  a  way  that  this  power  of  sight  is  not  afterwards  subdued  by 
the  darkness  of  night.  And  the  pupil  of  man  which  only  doubles  its 
quantity  sees  only  faint  light  and  almost  like  the  bat  which  does  not 
fly  in  times  of  too  great  darkness.  Fogli  b  13  v.

PUPIL  OF  CAT 

If  the  darkness  of  night  is  a  hundred  degrees  more  intense  than  that 
of  evening,  and  the  eye  of  man  doubles  the  size  of  its  pupil  in  darkness, 
this  darkness  is  lessened  by  half  in  this  eye  because  it  has  redoubled 
half  its  visible  potency:  there  remain  therefore  fifty  degrees  of  intensity 
of  darkness.  And  if  the  eye  of  the  owl  has  its  pupil  increased  a  hun- 
dred times  in  the  aforesaid  darkness  it  increases  its  visual  capacity  one 
hundred  times,  so  that  one  hundred  degrees  of  visual  capacity  are  ac- 
quired, and  because  things  which  are  equal  do  not  overcome  one  an- 
other the  bird  sees  in  the  darkness  with  the  pupil  increased  a  hundred- 
fold as  in  the  day  with  the  pupil  diminished  ninety  nine  parts  in  the 
hundred. 

And  if  you  were  to  say  that  this  animal  does  not  see  light  by  day  and 
for  this  reason  it  remains  shut  up,  to  this  I  reply  that  the  bird  only 
shuts  itself  up  in  the  day  in  order  to  free  itself  from  the  mobbing  of 
birds  which  in  a  great  multitude  always  surround  it  with  a  loud 
clamour,  and  frequently  they  would  be  put  to  death  if  they  did  not 
hide  themselves  in  the  grottos  and  caverns  of  the  high  rocks. 

Of  the  nocturnal  animals  only  the  lion  species  changes  the  shape  of 
its  pupil  as  that  enlarges  or  lessens :  for  when  it  is  at  the  utmost  stage  of 
diminution  it  is  long  in  shape,  when  half  way  it  is  oval,  and  when  it 
has  attained  to  its  utmost  expansion  it  is  circular  in  shape.

Death  in  the  old  without  fever  is  caused  by  the  skin  of  the  veins

they  close  up  and  no  longer  allow  a  passage  to  the  blood  which  feeds 
them. 

The  continual  passing  of  the  blood  in  these  veins  makes  them

idly  with  a  loose  curve  as  in  /;  but  it  should  be  as  in  j,  laid  over  the 
spongy  fat  that  lies  between  the  angles,  as  in  the  angle  n  m  o,  which 
angle  springs  at  the  end  of  the  contact  of  the  muscles.  And  because  the 
skin  cannot  descend  into  such  an  angle  nature  has  filled  it  with  a 
small  quantity  of  spongy  or  as  I  prefer  to  call  it  vesicular  fat,  that  is 
containing  small  cells  full  of  air,  which  become  condensed  or  rare- 
fied according  to  the  increase  or  rarefaction  of  the  substance  of  the 
muscles;  in  which  case  the  hollow  i  has  always  a  greater  curve  than 
the  muscle.  g  26  r. 

Make  an  anatomy  of  different  eyes  and  see  which  are  the  muscles 
that  open  and  close  the  above  mentioned  pupils  of  the  eyes  of  animals. 


OF  THE  EYES  OF  ANIMALS 

The  eyes  of  all  animals  have  pupils  which  have  power  to  increase 
or  diminish  of  their  own  accord  according  to  the  greater  or  less  light  of 
the  sun  or  other  luminary.  In  birds  however  the  difference  is  greater, 
and  especially  with  nocturnal  birds  of  the  owl  species  such  as  the  long- 
eared  the  white  and  the  brown  owls;  for  with  these  the  pupil  increases 
until  it  almost  covers  the  whole  eye  or  diminishes  to  the  size  of  a  grain 
of  millet,  preserving  all  the  time  its  round  shape.  But  in  the  lion 
species  such  as  panthers,  leopards,  lionesses,  tigers,  wolves,  lynxes, 
Spanish  cats  and  others  the  pupil  as  it  diminishes  changes  from  the 
perfect  circle  to  an  elliptical  figure  thus  [fig.]  as  is  seen  in  the  margin.

hurt  by  excessive  light  and  his  pupil  undergoes  less  increase  in  dark 
places.  As  regards  the  eyes  of  the  above-mentioned  nocturnal  animals, 
in  the  horned  owl  which  is  the  largest  nocturnal  bird  the  power  of 
vision  is  so  much  increased  that  even  in  the  faintest  glimmer  of  night 
which  we  call  darkness  it  can  see  more  distinctly  than  we  in  the  radi- 
ance of  noon,  when  these  birds  stay  hidden  in  dark  recesses;  or  if  they 
are  compelled  to  emerge  into  the  sunlit  air  the  pupil  contracts  so  much 
that  the  power  of  vision  diminishes  at  the  same  time  as  the  size  of 
the  pupil.  c  44  r.

Here  I  make  a  note  to  show  the  difference  there  is  between  man 
and  horse  and  in  the  same  way  with  the  other  animals. 

I  commence  first  with  the  bones,  and  then  go  on  to  all  the  muscles 
which  proceed  from  and  end  in  the  bones  without  tendons,  then  to 
those  which  proceed  from  and  end  in  the  bones  with  tendons  and 
then  those  which  have  a  single  tendon  on  one  side,  k  109  [29-30]  v. 

When  the  eye  of  the  bird  closes  with  its  two  coverings  it  closes  first 
the  secondina,  and  this  closes  it  from  the  lachrymal  gland  as  far  as  the 
angle  of  the  eye,  and  the  first  (covering)  closes  it  from  below  upwards. 
And  these  two  movements  having  intersected  cover  it  first  from  the 
direction  of  the  lachrymal  gland,  because  they  have  already  seen 
themselves  safeguarded  in  front  and  below;  and  they  only  reserve  the 
upper  part  because  of  the  dangers  from  birds  of  prey  which  descend 
from  above  and  behind,  and  they  will  first  uncover  the  membrane  in 
the  direction  of  the  angle,  for  if  the  enemy  comes  behind  the  bird 
will  have  the  opportunity  of  flying  forward.  It  also  has  the  membrane 
called  the  secondina  of  such  texture  as  to  be  transparent,  for  if  it  did 
not  possess  this  shield  it  would  not  be  able  to  keep  its  eyes  open 
against  the  wind  which  strikes  the  eye  in  the  fury  of  its  swift  flight. 
And  its  pupil  expands  and  contracts  as  it  beholds  less  or  greater  light, 
that  is,  radiance.  b.m.  64  v.

Where  there  is  life  there  is  heat;  where  there  is  vital  heat  there  is

The  common  sense  is  that  which  judges  the  things  given  to  it  by  the 
other  senses. 

[The  common  sense  is  set  in  motion  by  the  things  given  to  it  by  the  five 

senses] 

And  these  senses  are  moved  by  the  objects,  and  these  objects  send 
their  images  to  the  five  senses  by  which  they  are  transferred  to  the 
organ  of  perception  (imprensiva)  and  from  this  to  the  common  sense; 
and  from  thence  being  judged  they  are  transmitted  to  the  memory,  in 
which  according  to  their  potency  they  are  retained  more  or  less  dis- 
tinctly. 

[The  five  senses  are  these:  seeing,  hearing,  touch,  taste,  smell] 

The  ancient  speculators  have  concluded  that  that  faculty  of  judg- 
ment which  is  given  to  man  is  caused  by  an  instrument  with  which 
the  other  five  are  connected  by  means  of  the  organ  of  perception 
(imprensiva),  and  to  this  instrument  they  have  applied  the  name  com- 
mon sense,  and  they  say  that  this  sense  is  in  the  centre.  And  this  name 
common  sense  they  use  simply  because  it  is  the  common  judge  of  the 
other  B.YC  senses,  namely  seeing,  hearing,  touch,  taste  and  smell.  The 
common  sense  is  set  in  movement  by  means  of  the  organ  of  perception 
(imprensiva)  which  is  situated  in  the  centre  between  it  and  the  senses. 
The  organ  of  perception  acts  by  means  of  the  images  of  the  things 
presented  to  it  by  the  superficial  instruments,  that  is  the  senses,  which 
are  placed  in  the  middle  between  the  external  things  and  the  organ  of 
perception;  and  the  senses  act  in  the  same  way  through  the  medium  of 
objects. 

The  images  of  the  surrounding  things  are  transmitted  to  the  senses, 
and  the  senses  transmit  them  to  the  organ  of  perception,  and  the  organ 
of  perception  transmits  them  to  the  common  sense,  and  by  it  they  are 
imprinted  on  the  memory,  and  are  retained  there  more  or  less  distinctly 
according  to  the  importance  or  power  of  the  thing  given.  That  sense 
functions  most  swiftly  which  is  nearest  to  the  organ  of  perception;  this 
is  the  eye,  the  chief  and  leader  of  the  others;  of  this  only  we  will  treat 
and  leave  the  others  in  order  not  to  lengthen  out  our  material.

Experience  tells  us  that  the  eye  has  cognisance  of  ten  different  quali 
ties  of  objects;  to  wit,  light  and  darkness — one  serving  to  reveal  the

How  radiating  lines  carry  visual  potency  with  them  as  far  as  the 
striking  point: 

This  our  mind  or  common  sense  which  the  philosophers  affirm 
makes  its  dwelling  in  the  centre  of  the  head  keeps  its  spiritual  members 
at  a  great  distance  away  from  itself,  and  this  is  clearly  seen  in  the  lines 
of  the  visual  rays  which  after  terminating  in  an  object  transmit  imme- 
diately to  their  cause  the  characteristics  of  the  form  of  their  breaking. 

Also — in  the  sense  of  touch  which  derives  from  the  common  sense — 
does  not  one  see  it  extending  itself  with  its  power  as  far  as  the  tips  of 
the  fingers,  for  as  soon  as  these  points  have  touched  the  object  the 
sense  is  immediately  made  aware  of  whether  it  is  hot  or  cold  or  hard 
or  soft  or  pointed  or  smooth.  c.a.  270  v.  b 

OF  THE  GAIT  OF  MAN 

The  gait  of  man  is  always  after  the  manner  of  the  universal  gait  of 
four-footed  animals;  seeing  that  as  these  move  their  feet  crosswise,  as  a 
horse  does  when  it  trots,  so  a  man  moves  his  four  limbs  crosswise,  that 
is  if  he  thrusts  the  right  foot  forward  as  he  walks  he  thrusts  the  left 
arm  forward  with  it,  and  so  it  always  continues.  c.a.  297  r.  b

and  in  the  cold  countries  everything  is  the  opposite.        c.a.  393  v.  a

Consider  the  fish,  which  on  account  of  the  continuous  friction  that 
of  necessity  it  makes  with  the  water,  from  its  own  life  being  a  daughter

found  to  exist  between  the  joints  of  the  scales,  of  a  certain  slimy  dis-

Natural  History 

'Why  is  the  fish  in  the  water  swifter  than  the 
bird  in  the  air  when  it  ought  to  be  the  con- 
trary, seeing  that  the  water  is  heavier  and  thicker 
than  the  air,  and  the  fish  is  heavier  and  has 
smaller  wings  than  the  bird?' 

Lobsters  and  crabs  are  empty  at  the  waning  of  the  moon,  for  there 
is  little  light  for  them  to  feed  themselves  by,  and  if  one  brings  them  a 
Hght  at  night  they  all  hasten  to  this  light. 

And  when  the  moon  is  at  the  full  they  see  their  food  well  and  eat  of 
it  abundantly.  c.a.  165  v.  b 

Why  is  the  fish  in  the  water  swifter  than  the  bird  in  the  air  when  it 
ought  to  be  the  contrary  seeing  that  the  water  is  heavier  and  thicker 
than  the  air  and  the  fish  is  heavier  and  has  smaller  wings  than  the 
bird?  For  this  reason  the  fish  is  not  moved  from  its  place  by  the  swift 
currents  of  the  water  as  is  the  bird  by  the  fury  of  the  winds  amid  the 
air;  and  in  addition  to  this  we  may  see  the  fish  speeding  upwards  on 
the  very  course  down  which  water  has  fallen  abruptly  with  very  rapid 
movement,  after  the  manner  of  lightning  amid  the  incessant  clouds, 
which  seems  a  marvellous  thing.  And  this  results  from  the  immense 
speed  with  which  it  moves  which  so  exceeds  the  movement  of  the 
water  as  to  cause  it  to  seem  motionless  in  comparison  with  the  move- 
ment of  the  fish.  The  proportion  of  the  said  movements  is  as  one  is  to 
ten;  the  movement  of  the  water  being  as  one  and  that  of  the  fish  ten 
and  exceeding  it  therefore  by  nine.  Therefore  although  the  fish  has  the 
power  ten  it  is  left  with  the  power  nine,  for  as  it  leaps  up  the  descent — 
its  power  being  ten  and  the  water  taking  away  one  from  it — nine 
remains. 

This  happens  because  the  water  is  of  itself  thicker  than  the  air  and 
in  consequence  heavier,  and  therefore  it  is  swifter  in  filling  up  the 

204 


NATURAL  HISTORY  205 

vacuum  which  the  fish  leaves  behind  it  in  the  place  from  whence  it 
departs,  and  also  the  water  which  it  strikes  in  front  of  itself  is  not  com- 
pressed as  is  the  air  in  front  of  the  bird  but  rather  makes  a  wave  which 
by  us  movement  prepares  the  way  for  and  increases  the  movement  of 
the  fish,  and  for  this  reason  it  is  swifter  than  the  bird  in  front  of  which 
the  air  is  condensed.  c.a.  168  v.  b 

HOW  OXEN  FEED  ON  TALL  PLANTS 

Oxen  in  order  to  feed  on  the  leaves  of  tall  slender  plants  such  as 
young  poplars  and  the  like  are  in  the  habit  of  raising  themselves  up,  so 
that  they  stride  with  their  legs  across  the  base  of  the  plant  and  press 
continually  forward  in  such  a  way  that  the  plant,  being  unable  to  bear 
up  against  the  oppressive  weight,  is  obliged  to  give  way  and  bow  down 
its  lofty  top.  c.a.  297  r.  b

and  lower  lids  the  second  images  are  reflected  in  the  pupil  of  the  eye  c. 
But  as  regards  the  pupil  that  receives  the  three  said  images  which  are 
divided  by  the  images  of  the  lids  of  the  eyes  (in  this  instance  almost 
closed),  it  seems  that  the  images  of  the  luminous  bodies  impressed  on 
the  thick  parts  of  the  lids  of  the  eyes  are  as  though  actually  subdivided 
and  that  these  divisions  are  pyramidal  because  the  intervals  between 
the  lids  are  also  pyramidal.  And  since  to  the  pupil  which  receives 
these  three  images  it  seems  that  the  two  images  which  rebound  upon 
it  from  the  lids  are  joined  together  above  and  below  to  the  image  of 
the  centre  which  represents  the  luminous  body,  it  seems  to  this  pupil 
that  the  image  b  is  in  a  n,  and  the  image  o  appears  to  be  in  a  m,  and 
that  the  two  images  are  divided  by  the  image  of  the  luminous  body  a. 

And  since  in  closing  together  the  rims  of  the  eyelids  it  is  necessary 
that  the  watery  substance  continually  keeps  the  lids  moistened  as  they 
rub  upon  the  eye,  so  this  moisture  fills  up  the  angle  that  is  produced  by 
the  contact  made  by  the  lids  with  the  pupil  of  the  eye,  and  the  surface 
of  this  watery  substance  is  concave,  as  is  proved  in  the  fourth  of  the 
eighth  of  water  where  it  states  that  'the  contact  which  water  makes 
with  its  moist  bank  will  always  have  its  surface  concave',  and  that  'if 
this  bank  is  dry  the  surface  of  the  water  that  borders  upon  it  will  be 
convex'. 

This  angle  therefore  finding  itself  created  by  the  contact  between  the 
lid  of  the  eye  and  its  pupil  will  have  the  surface  of  the  aqueous  humour 
filling  up  this  angle  of  the  concave  figure.  And  since  every  concave 
mirror  shows  within  the  pyramidal  concourse  of  its  rays  the  image  of 
its  object  upside  down,  it  follows  therefore  that  the  weights  or  lids  of 
the  eyes  mirrored  within  this  hollow  together  with  the  image  of  the 
light  will  show  these  lids  inverted;  and  this  is  the  reason  why  when 
the  pupil  is  within  the  concourse  of  the  pyramidal  rays  of  the  concave 
mirror  the  pupil  sees  the  pyramids  formed  by  the  rays  of  the  spaces 
between  the  lids  upside  down. 

And  this  is  the  true  reason  of  the  rays  of  luminous  bodies  which  the 
more  they  extend  seem  to  approach  nearer  to  the  eye.  Such  a  demon- 
stration however  ought  to  be  divided  into  its  parts  in  order  to  render 
it  more  intelligible,  setting  out  first  its  conceptions  and  other  proposi- 
tions necessary  for  such  proof.  d   i   v.

Whether  the  Images  of  objects  are  taken  by  the  visual  faculty  to  the 
surface  of  the  eye  or  whether  they  pass  within  it: 

The  glasses  of  spectacles  show  us  how  the  images  of  objects  pause  at 
the  surface  of  these  glasses  and  then  by  bending  themselves  penetrate 
from  this  surface  to  the  surface  of  the  eye,  from  which  surface  it  is 
possible  for  the  eye  to  see  the  shapes  of  the  aforesaid  objects. 

This  is  proved  to  be  possible  because  this  surface  is  the  common 
boundary  between  the  air  and  the  eye,  in  that  it  separates  the  vitreous 
humour  from  the  air  and  separates  the  air  from  this  vitreous  humour. 
And  if  we  wish  to  affirm  that  the  images  of  the  objects  stop  on  the  sur- 
faces of  the  spectacles  one  might  say  that  in  the  spectacles  of  old  men 
the  object  would  seem  much  larger  than  the  reality,  and  but  for  the 
interposition  of  this  glass  between  the  eye  and  the  object  this  object 
would  show  itself  of  its  natural  size;  therefore  [this  not  being  so]  is  a 
clear  proof  that  the  convergence  of  the  images  of  any  object  which  is 
cut  by  the  interposition  of  transparent  bodies  will  impress  itself  on  the 
surface  of  these  bodies  and  will  there  create  a  new  convergence  which 
will  lead  the  images  of  these  objects  to  the  eye.  d  2  r. 

How  the  images  of  any  object  whatsoever  which  pass  to  the  eye 
through  some  aperture  imprint  themselves  on  its  pupil  upside  down 
and  the  understanding  sees  them  upright: 

The  pupil  of  the  eye  which  receives  through  a  very  small  round  hole 
the  images  of  bodies  situated  beyond  this  hole  always  receives  them 
upside  down  and  the  visual  faculty  always  sees  them  upright  as  they 
are.  And  this  proceeds  from  the  fact  that  the  said  images  pass  through 
the  centre  of  the  crystalline  sphere  situated  in  the  middle  of  the  eye; 
and  in  this  centre  they  unite  in  a  point  and  then  spread  themselves  out 
upon  the  opposite  surface  of  this  sphere  without  deviating  from  their 
course;  and  the  images  direct  themselves  upon  this  surface  according  to 
the  object  that  has  caused  them,  and  from  thence  they  are  taken  by  the 
impression  and  transmitted  to  the  common  sense  where  they  are 
judged.  This  may  be  proved  thus: — let  a  n  be  the  pupil  of  the  eye  \  h, 
and  let  p  be  a  small  round  hole  made  in  the  paper  with  the  fine  point 
of  a  style,  and  let  m  b  be  the  object  placed  beyond  this  opening.  I  main- 
tain that  the  upper  part  of  this  object  cannot  come  to  the  upper  part 
of  the  pupil  of  the  eye  through  the  straight  line  m  a  because  at  v  its 


220  OPTICS 

passage  is  impeded  by  the  interposition  of  the  paper.  But  this  upper  ex- 
tremity m  passes  in  a  straight  course  through  the  hole  to  n  the  lower 
part  of  the  pupil,  or  you  would  say  of  the  crystalline  sphere,  and  from 
there  it  directs  its  course  to  the  centre  of  this  sphere,  then  rises  to  the 
upper  part  of  the  opposite  side  and  from  there  as  has  been  said  it  runs 
to  the  common  sense.  d  2  v. 

Why  the  mirror  in  its  images  of  objects  changes  the  right  side  to  the 
left  and  the  left  to  the  right: 

The  image  of  every  object  is  changed  in  the  mirror  so  that  its  right 
side  is  opposite  to  the  left  of  the  object  reflected  and  similarly  the  left 
to  the  right.  This  is  of  necessity  the  case  because  every  natural  action  is 
performed  by  nature  in  the  shortest  manner  and  the  briefest  time  pos- 
sible. Let  a  b  be  a  face  which  sends  its  image  to  the  mirror  c  d,  this 
face  will  have  another  face  in  this  mirror  turned  towards  it,  so  that  it 
will  have  the  left  eye  c  opposite  to  the  right  a  and  similarly  the  right 
eye  d  will  be  opposite  to  the  left  eye  b. 

And  if  it  should  be  urged  by  the  opponent  that  the  right  eye  of  the 
image  was  opposite  to  the  right  of  the  object  we  might  project  the  lines 
from  the  right  eye  of  the  image  to  the  right  eye  of  the  object  and  simi- 
larly from  the  left  to  the  left,  these  lines  being  a  d  and  b  c  which  are 
seen  to  intersect;  and  it  is  proved  that  in  all  cases  of  lines  intersecting 
the  right  extremity  of  the  one  is  always  opposite  to  the  left  extremity 
of  the  other,  and  this  result  is  not  produced  by  the  shortest  line  because 
the  diagonal  of  a  square  is  always  longer  than  its  side,  and  here  a  d  is 
the  diagonal  of  the  square  a  b  c  d  of  which  a  c  is  one  of  its  sides;  and 
thus  is  concluded  what  was  necessary  in  order  to  prove  such  a  result. 

And  this  effect  in  the  mirror  would  be  as  though  someone  who  was 
looking  at  you,  someone  that  is  who  has  the  left  eye  opposite  to  your 
right,  were  as  by  a  miracle  transposing  left  and  right  as  is  the  case  with 
letters  used  in  stamping  and  wax  which  takes  the  impress  of  the  cor- 
nelian, d  4  r. 

OF  THE  HUMAN  EYE 

The  pupil  of  the  eye  changes  to  as  many  different  sizes  as  there  are 
differences  in  the  degrees  of  brightness  and  obscurity  of  the  objects 
which  present  themselves  before  it: 


OPTICS  221 

In  this  case  nature  has  provided  for  the  visual  faculty  when  it  has 
been  irritated  by  excessive  light  by  contracting  the  pupil  of  the  eye,  and 
by  enlarging  this  pupil  after  the  manner  of  the  mouth  of  a  purse  when 
it  has  had  to  endure  varying  degrees  of  darkness.  And  here  nature 
works  as  one  who  having  too  much  light  in  his  habitation  blocks  up 
the  window  half-way  or  more  or  less  according  to  the  necessity,  and 
who  when  the  night  comes  throws  open  the  whole  of  this  window  in 
order  to  see  better  within  this  habitation.  Nature  is  here  establishing  a 
continual  equilibrium,  perpetually  adjusting  and  equalising  by  making 
the  pupil  dilate  or  contract  in  proportion  to  the  aforesaid  obscurity  or 
brightness  which  continually  presents  itself  before  it.  You  will  see  the 
process  in  the  case  of  the  nocturnal  animals  such  as  cats,  screech-owls, 
long-eared  owls  and  suchlike  which  have  the  pupil  small  at  midday 
and  very  large  at  night.  And  it  is  the  same  with  all  land  animals  and 
those  of  the  air  and  of  the  water  but  more,  beyond  all  comparison, 
with  the  nocturnal  animals. 

And  if  you  wish  to  make  the  experiment  with  a  man  look  intently 
at  the  pupil  of  his  eye  while  you  hold  a  lighted  candle  at  a  little  dis- 
tance away  and  make  him  look  at  this  light  as  you  bring  it  nearer  to 
him  little  by  little,  and  you  will  then  see  that  the  nearer  the  light  ap- 
proaches to  it  the  more  the  pupil  will  contract. 

Whether  the  eye  sees  bright  and  dark  things  at  the  same  time: 
The  crystalline  humour  which  dwells  within  the  pupil  is  condensed 
on  meeting  with  shining  things  and  becomes  rarefied  on  meeting  with 
dark  things;  and  the  truth  of  this  is  shown  in  closing  the  eye,  for  then 
the  images  retained  which  were  of  bright  things  seem  dark  and  those 
of  dark  things  seem  bright;  and  this  happens  more  with  weak  eyes 
than  with  those  that  are  strong,  and  of  this  I  will  speak  more  fully  in 
its  place. 

There  follows  the  discourse  concerning  the  eye  of  the  nocturnal 
animals  which  see  better  by  night  than  by  day.  And  this  comes  about 
because  the  size  of  the  eyes  is  greater  than  the  whole  of  the  brain, 
especially  in  the  case  of  the  long-eared  and  short-eared  owls,  the  white 
owls,  the  little  owls  and  horned  owls  and  suchlike  creatures,  but  it  does 
not  occur  with  man  who  has  a  greater  brain  in  proportion  to  the  size 


222  OPTICS 

of  his  eyes  than  any  other  animal  that  lives  on  land,  and  can  see  but 
little  light  after  day-time.  d  5  v. 

There  follows  concerning  the  eye  of  the  nocturnal  animals  which 
see  more  by  night  than  by  day,  and  this  arises  in  great  part  from  the 
fact  that  as  was  said  before  there  is  a  much  greater  difference  between 
the  size  of  the  pupil  when  dilated  and  contracted  than  there  is  in  the 
case  of  the  animals  which  are  active  by  day,  for  if  the  pupil  of  the  man 
doubles  its  diameter  at  night,  that  is  to  say  it  is  increased  to  four  times 
what  it  is  by  day,  the  diameter  of  the  pupil  of  the  horned  owl  or  the 
long-eared  owl  is  increased  to  ten  times  what  it  is  by  day  which 
amounts  to  saying  that  the  pupil  is  a  hundred  times  as  large  as  it  is 
by  day. 

Furthermore  the  ventricle  situated  in  the  brain  of  man  called  the 
imprensiva  is  more  than  ten  times  the  whole  of  the  eye  of  man,  and  of 
this  the  pupil  in  which  the  sight  has  its  origin  is  less  than  a  thousandth 
part;  and  in  the  case  of  the  long-eared  owl  the  pupil  at  night  is  con- 
siderably larger  than  the  ventricle  of  the  imprensiva  situated  in  its 
brain.  From  this  it  follows  that  the  imprensiva  in  man  is  greater  in 
proportion  to  the  pupil,  it  being  in  fact  ten  thousand  times  as  great 
whereas  in  the  case  of  the  horned  owl  they  are  almost  equal. 

And  this  imprensiva  of  man  in  comparison  with  that  of  the  long- 
eared  owl  is  like  a  great  room  which  receives  the  light  through  a  small 
hole  as  compared  with  a  small  room  which  is  entirely  open.  For  within 
the  great  room  there  will  be  night  at  midday  and  in  the  small  one 
which  is  open  there  will  be  day  at  midnight  when  the  weather  is  not 
overcast.  And  herewith  may  be  shown  the  workings  of  the  most  pow- 
erful causes  by  means  of  the  anatomy  of  the  eyes  and  the  imprensiva 
of  these  two  animals,  namely  of  man  and  of  the  horned  [long-eared?] 
owl. 

That  object  will  seem  of  greater  radiance  and  size  which  is  seen  by  a 
larger  pupil.  One  may  make  an  experiment  of  this  with  our  eyes  by 
making  as  small  a  hole  as  possible  in  a  sheet  of  paper  and  then  bring- 
ing it  as  near  as  possible  to  the  eye,  and  if  then  you  look  at  a  star 
through  this  hole  you  are  only  making  use  of  a  small  part  of  the  pupil, 
which  sees  this  star  with  a  wide  space  of  sky  round  it  and  sees  it  so  small 
that  hardly  anything  can  be  less.  And  if  you  make  the  hole  near  to  the 
edge  of  the  said  paper  you  will  be  able  to  see  the  same  star  with  the 


OPTICS  223 

other  eye  at  the  same  time  and  it  will  appear  to  you  to  be  large,  and 
thus  in  the  said  time  you  will  see  the  one  star  twice  with  your  two  eyes 
and  once  it  will  be  small  and  the  other  time  large.  Further  you  will  be 
able  to  see  the  whole  body  of  the  sun  and  with  only  a  moderate 
amount  of  radiance,  for  the  more  its  size  is  diminished  so  in  proportion 
is  its  radiance  as  was  set  forth  above.  And  from  this  it  arises  that  the 
large  pupils  (luce?)  see  but  little  of  the  daylight  because  the  excess  of 
radiance  impedes  their  vision.  d  5  r. 

The  image  of  the  sun  is  unique  in  all  the  watery  sphere  which  sees 
and  is  seen  by  this  sun,  but  it  seems  divided  into  as  many  parts  as  are 
the  eyes  of  the  animals  which  from  different  positions  behold  the  sur- 
face of  the  water. 

This  that  is  set  forth  is  proved  because  however  far  the  eyes  of  the 
navigators  carried  by  ships  may  move  through  the  universe  they  behold 
at  the  same  time  the  image  of  the  sun  through  all  the  waters  of  their 
hemisphere  in  all  the  movements  made  in  all  the  aspects. 

If  the  eye  was  as  large  as  the  sphere  of  the  water  it  would  see  the 
image  of  the  sun  covering  a  great  part  of  the  ocean. 

This  is  shown  because  if  you  were  to  move  yourself  upon  a  bridge 
from  which  you  can  see  the  image  of  the  sun  in  the  waters  of  its  river, 
and  you  move  yourself  about  twenty-five  braccia,  you  will  see  the 
image  of  the  sun  move  just  as  far  in  the  surface  of  the  said  water.  And 
so  if  one  were  to  put  together  all  the  images  that  are  seen  during  this 
movement  you  would  have  a  single  image  which  would  be  of  the  shape 
of  a  fiery  beam.  Now  imagine  yourself  to  make  a  circle  of  which  this 
beam  is  the  diameter,  and  that  the  whole  of  this  circle  is  full  of  these 
images,  without  doubt  you  would  see  one  image  the  diameter  of  which 
would  be  twenty-five  braccia;  now  you  must  understand  that  if  a  pupil 
were  to  have  its  diameter  the  same  twenty-five  braccia  it  would  without 
moving  itself  see  in  the  same  water  an  image  of  the  sun  which  would 
revolve  in  seventy-eight  braccia  and  four  sevenths. 

If  through  the  long  distance  at  which  the  eye  was  from  the  watery 
sphere  the  watery  sphere  should  become  diminished  to  the  size  of  an 
ordinary  image  of  the  sun,  as  is  shown  in  perspective,  you  would  see 
the  sphere  of  this  water  which  is  seen  by  the  sun  was  a  single  image  of 
this  sun. 

This  is  proved  in  perspective  how  things  remote  from  the  eye  even 


224  OPTICS 

when  they  are  exceedingly  large  seem  very  small  in  bulk,  and  this  may 
be  seen  without  any  elaborate  demonstration  if  you  raise  your  eyes  to 
the  sky  when  it  is  bedecked  with  stars,  for  you  will  see  there  many  stars 
which  are  many  times  larger  than  the  earth  and  yet  appear  very  small 
on  account  of  their  great  distance,  and  the  light  which  you  perceive  in 
them  is  not  their  own  but  is  merely  an  image  of  the  sun  reflected  in 
them.  For  of  themselves  these  stars  have  no  light,  but  they  have  a  sur- 
face like  the  watery  sphere  suitable  for  receiving  and  giving  back  the 
light  of  the  sun  which  is  reflected  in  them.  d  6  r. 


OF  THE  HUMAN  EYE 

The  pupil  of  the  eye  has  a  power  of  vision  all  in  the  whole  and  all  in 
each  of  its  parts;  and  an  object  placed  in  front  of  the  eye  which  is  less 
than  its  pupil  does  not  occupy  the  place  in  the  eye  of  any  other  dis- 
tant object,  and  although  it  is  compact  it  serves  the  function  of  a  trans- 
parent object. 

Here  the  adversary  says  that  the  power  of  vision  is  reduced  to  a  point 
and  that  it  follows  from  this  that  every  object  placed  in  front  of  the  pupil 
which  is  greater  than  this  point  will  occupy  the  attention  [of  the  eye], 
I  say  in  reply  to  him  that  if  it  were  true  that  the  power  of  vision  was 
reduced  to  a  point,  the  convexity  of  the  eye  which  with  its  parts  is 
turned  towards  a  great  part  of  the  universe  which  is  opposite  to  it 
would  not  be  able  to  have  such  a  curve  unless  it  were  equidistant  from 
this  point  and  its  surface  were  cut  at  an  equal  distance  from  this  point, 
so  that  each  of  them  with  the  same  actual  proportions  correspond  in 
the  points  of  the  angles  to  the  proportions  of  the  images  of  the  bodies 
that  meet  at  this  point. 

To  such  a  one  it  is  necessary  to  appeal  to  experience  and  then  to 
show  this  experience  to  be  conclusive;  and  first  as  regards  experience 
if  you  place  in  front  of  the  pupil  the  thick  end  of  a  sewing  needle  of 
medium  width  as  near  as  possible  you  will  see  that  the  perception  of 
any  object  placed  behind  this  needle  at  however  great  a  distance  will 
not  be  interfered  with. 

What  I  say  is  entirely  borne  out  by  experience  and  necessity  con- 
firms it;  for  if  this  visual  faculty  be  reducible  to  a  point  every  object 
however  small  placed  in  front  of  it  would  occupy  the  attention  of  a 


OPTICS  225 

great  part  of  the  heaven,  for  if  a  great  part  of  the  heaven  transmits  the 
images  oi  its  stars  to  the  pupil  an  object  placed  near  to  it  and  equal  to 
the  half  of  its  diameter  would  cover  almost  the  half  of  the  sky.  This  is 
why  nature  in  order  that  nothing  may  be  lacking  for  the  eyes  of  the 
animals  has  caused  this  pupil  to  have  the  smallest  number  of  obstruc- 
tions and  less  than  may  seem  possible,  among  which  the  faculty  of 
vision  would  be  the  greatest  because  as  has  been  said  every  object  how- 
ever small  set  over  against  it  would  take  up  a  great  amount  of  space. 
Moreover,  experiment  proves  that  sheets  of  canvas  made  out  of  thick 
horse-hair  and  placed  in  front  of  the  eyes  do  not  cover  anything  behind 
them  and  conceal  it  the  less  in  proportion  as  they  are  nearer  to  the  eye, 
whereas  if  the  faculty  of  vision  were  focused  in  a  point  the  nearer  to  it 
were  the  horse-hairs,  the  larger  would  be  the  space  that  they  would 
occupy.  As  therefore  experience  demonstrates  the  contrary  it  is  true 
that  the  visual  faculty  is  infused  through  the  whole  pupil  and  makes 
use  of  every  part  of  it  and  looks  beyond  this  horsehair  encompassing  it 
and  penetrating  through  the  thickest  part  of  it,  and  of  necessity  form- 
ing pyramids  near  the  aforesaid  horse-hairs.  d  6  v. 

Every  concave  place  will  appear  darker  if  seen  from  the  outside  than 
from  within. 

And  this  comes  about  because  the  eye  that  is  outside  in  the  air  has 
the  pupil  much  diminished,  and  that  which  is  situated  in  a  dark  place 
has  the  pupil  enlarged  and  with  the  lesser  eyeball  the  power  is  dimin- 
ished, and  in  like  manner  this  power  increases  in  proportion  to  the  in- 
crease of  its  pupil,  and  when  the  pupil  is  of  feeble  power  every  small 
obscurity  will  appear  dark,  and  as  it  grows  in  power  every  great  ob- 
scurity will  appear  lit  up. 

Excess  of  light  injures  the  eye  and  in  order  to  protect  it  from  being 
injured  in  this  way  the  visual  faculty  takes  the  help  which  any  one  gets 
who  shuts  part  of  a  window  in  order  to  lessen  the  excessive  bright- 
ness which  the  sun  produces  in  his  dwelling.  d  7  r. 

Why  the  right  object  does  not  seem  the  left  to  the  eye: 

The  images  of  the  objects  in  the  eye  when  making  their  entry  into 

the  eye  deflect  their  rays  in  a  way  that  is  proved  in  perspective  when 

chese  images  pass  from  the  density  of  the  water  to  the  thinness  of  the 

air.  But  to  come  back  to  the  proposition  that  the  right  object  does  not 


226  OPTICS 

appear  the  left  in  the  eye,  we  see  clearly  by  experiment  that  the  images 
which  penetrate  into  the  vitreous  humour  by  the  pupil  of  the  eye  meet 
together  in  the  sphere  of  the  crystalline  humour,  as  to  which  two  con- 
siderations present  themselves,  namely  whether  the  visual  faculty  re- 
sides in  it  or  at  the  extremity  of  the  optic  nerve,  which  extremity 
catches  these  images  and  transmits  them  to  the  common  sense  as  do 
the  nerves  of  the  sense  of  smell.  And  if  this  faculty  resides  in  the  centre 
of  the  crystalline  humour  it  catches  the  images  with  its  surface,  and 
they  are  referred  there  from  the  surface  of  the  pupil,  where  the  objects 
are  mirrored  or  reflected  there  from  the  surface  of  the  uvea  which 
bounds  and  clothes  the  vitreous  humour  which  has  darkness  behind  its 
transparency,  just  as  behind  the  transparency  of  the  glass  we  find  the 
darkness  of  the  lead  in  order  that  objects  may  be  the  better  mirrored 
in  the  surface  of  this  glass.  But  if  the  visual  faculty  is  in  the  centre  of 
the  crystalline  sphere  all  the  objects  which  are  given  it  from  the  sur- 
face of  the  pupil  of  the  eye  will  appear  in  the  true  position  in  which 
they  are,  and  will  not  change  from  the  right  to  the  left  and  will  seem 
larger,  as  is  shown  in  perspective.  And  if  this  crystalline  sphere  takes 
these  images  reflected  from  the  concavity  of  the  uvea  it  will  take  them 
upright  although  the  uvea  is  a  concave  mirror,  and  it  will  take  them 
upright  because  the  centre  of  the  crystalline  sphere  is  concentric  with 
the  centre  of  the  sphere  of  the  uvea. 

It  is  true  that  the  images  which  pass  to  this  uvea  as  they  are  outside 
the  eye  pass  to  it  through  the  centre  of  the  crystalline  sphere,  and  hav- 
ing arrived  at  the  uvea  they  become  inverted  as  also  are  those  which 
pass  to  the  uvea  without  passing  through  this  humour.  We  may  sur- 
mise therefore,  admitting  this  visual  faculty  to  reside  at  the  extremity 
of  the  optic  nerve,  that  from  here  it  may  be  seen  in  the  crystalline 
sphere  that  all  the  objects  caught  by  it  are  upright,  for  it  takes  those 
that  were  inverted  in  the  uvea  and  inverts  them  once  again,  and  con- 
sequently this  crystalline  sphere  presents  the  images  upright  which 
were  given  to  it  inverted.  To  such  master  in  optics  one  would  perhaps 
say  that  the  spherical  surface  of  the  crystalline  sphere  united  to  the 
sphere  of  the  vitreous  humour  does  not  change  its  nature,  and  it  is  as 
though  the  whole  was  vitreous,  and  that  for  this  reason  the  vitreous 
sphere  does  not  fulfil  the  same  function  as  it  would  if  it  were  sur- 
rounded by  the  air.  The  reply  to  this  however  is  that  this  result  can- 


OPTICS  227 

not  occur  because  a  ball  of  crystal  placed  in  water  fulfils  the  same 
function  as  it  does  in  air.  d  7  v. 

The  images  of  the  objects  placed  before  the  eye  pass  to  the  vitreous 
sphere  by  the  gate  of  the  pupil,  and  they  intersect  within  this  pupil  in 
such  a  way  that  the  vitreous  sphere  is  struck  on  its  left  side  by  the  right 
ray  of  the  right  sphere,  and  it  does  the  same  on  the  opposite  side;  after- 
wards it  penetrates  this  vitreous  sphere,  and  the  rays  contract  and  find 
themselves  much  closer  together  when  they  are  on  the  opposite  side  of 
this  sphere  than  when  they  strike  it  in  the  beginning. 

And  this  process  of  contraction  proceeds  from  the  fact  that  the  rays 
of  the  images  approach  the  perpendicular  when  they  pass  from  the 
thin  to  the  dense,  and  that  the  albugineous  humour  is  here  much  thin- 
ner and  more  subtle  than  the  space  enclosed  by  the  surface  of  the 
vitreous  sphere.  Afterwards  (the  image)  ought  to  enlarge  as  it  returns 
into  this  albugineous  humour,  but  it  does  not  follow  this  rule  because  it 
is  constrained  to  obey  the  nature  of  the  vitreous  sphere  from  whence 
it  proceeds  rather  than  that  of  the  albugineous  humour  through  which 
it  passes. 

And  this  is  why  it  makes  a  pyramid  as  it  issues  forth  from  the 
vitreous  sphere  and  passes  through  the  albugineous  humour,  and  inter- 
sects its  sides  at  the  point  /;  and  passes  to  the  visual  faculty  g  at  the 
extremity  of  the  optic  nerve  g  s. 

Of  the  intersection  of  the  images  of  the  objects  received  by  the  eye 
within  the  albugineous  humour: 

Experience  which  shows  that  the  objects  transmit  their  images  or 
likenesses  intersected  within  the  eye  in  the  albugineous  humour  shows 
[what  happens]  when  the  images  of  the  illuminated  objects  penetrate 
through  some  small  round  hole  into  a  very  dark  habitation.  You  will 
then  receive  these  images  on  a  sheet  of  white  paper  placed  inside  this 
habitation  somewhat  near  to  this  small  hole,  and  you  will  see  all  the 
aforesaid  objects  on  this  paper  with  their  true  shapes  and  colours,  but 
they  will  be  less,  and  they  will  be  upside  down  because  of  the  said 
intersection. 

These  images  if  they  proceed  from  a  place  that  is  lit  by  the  sun  will 
actually  seem  painted  upon  this  paper,  which  should  be  very  thin  and 
seen  in  reverse;  and  the  said  hole  should  be  made  in  a  very  thin  sheet 


228  OPTICS 

of  iron.  Let  a  b  c  d  e  be  the  said  objects  lit  by  the  sun,  o  x  be  the 
facade  of  the  dark  habitation  in  which  is  the  said  hole  at  n  tn,  s  t  the 
said  paper  where  the  rays  of  the  images  of  these  objects  inverted  are 
cut,  for  as  their  rays  are  straight  a  which  is  right  becomes  left  at  \  and 
e  which  is  left  becomes  right  at  /,  and  so  it  is  within  the  pupil.

Why  the  point  of  the  style  when  placed  across  the  pupil  of  the  eye 
throws  a  great  shadow  upon  the  object: 

When  the  point  of  the  style  is  placed  crosswise  before  the  pupil  of 
the  eye,  the  diameter  of  its  thickness  being  considerably  less  than  the 
diameter  of  this  pupil,  it  will  occupy  more  or  less  space  against  other 
objects  in  proportion  as  it  is  nearer  or  more  remote  from  the  eye;  and 
this  occupation  of  space  will  obscure  but  will  not  prevent  the  passage 
of  the  images  of  the  aforesaid  objects.  d  9  r. 

Why  the  rays  of  the  luminous  bodies  increase  in  proportion  to  the 
space  that  is  interposed  between  them  and  the  eye: 

The  lengths  of  the  rays  created  by  the  luminous  bodies  increase  with 
the  increase  of  the  space  that  is  interposed  between  these  bodies  and 
the  eye.  It  is  necessary  here  first  to  define  what  are  the  rays  of  the  lu- 
minous bodies,  and  whether  they  have  their  origin  in  the  eye  which 
looks  at  these  bodies  or  in  fact  proceed  from  these  luminous  bodies, 
and  if  we  should  conclude  that  they  proceed  from  the  eye  it  is  neces. 
sary  to  define  why  and  in  what  manner. 

Why  the  luminous  bodies  show  their  contours  full  of  straight  lumi- 
nous rays: 

The  rays  which  reveal  the  contours  of  luminous  bodies  do  not  derive 
their  origin  from  these  bodies  but  from  their  images  which  imprint 
themselves  upon  the  thickness  of  the  lids  of  the  eyes  that  look  upon 
these  bodies.  This  we  learn  in  the  first  place  by  the  inductive  method 
which  teaches  us  that  the  eye  when  wide  open  does  not  show  us  such 
rays  round  luminous  bodies,  and  that  if  the  image  of  a  star  or  other 
light  should  pass  to  the  eye  through  the  smallest  perforation  made  in 
the  paper  placed  before  the  eye,  such  luminous  [images]  will  always 
be  without  rays.  But  the  real  proof  is  shown  by  the  ninth  of  Perspective 
where  it  is  stated: — the  angle  of  the  incidence  is  always  equal  to  the 


OPTICS  229 

angle  of  the  reflection, — therefore,  the  rays,  which  seem  as  though  they 
extend  from  the  luminous  body  to  make  contact  with  the  eye  that  be- 
holds it,  start  when  the  eye,  being  almost  closed  up,  looks  through  the 
narrow  crack  that  intervenes  between  the  eyelids,  at  that  luminous 
body  of  which  the  image  is  reflected  in  the  thick  parts  of  the  lids  which 
end  these  coverings,  and  after  making  this  impress  is  reflected  on  the 
pupil  of  the  eye;  which  pupil  receives  three  images  from  the  same  lu- 
minous body,  namely  two  in  the  thick  parts  of  the  lids  of  the  coverings 
of  the  eye  and  one  in  the  pupil,  and  through  these  three  images  being 
very  near  one  to  another,  they  seem  to  the  eye  to  be  continuous  and 
joined  to  the  image  of  the  pupil. 

And  the  proof  that  experience  offers  us  to  confirm  this  proposition  is 
shown  when  you  raise  or  lower  the  face  while  keeping  the  eye  firmly 
fixed  upon  the  luminous  body;  for  as  the  face  is  raised  the  eye  will 
lose  all  the  lower  rays  of  this  luminous  body.  This  comes  about  because 
the  image  of  this  luminous  body  does  not  proceed  to  imprint  itself  in 
the  thic\  part  of  the  lower  lid  of  this  eye1;  where  the  luminous  body 
does  not  see  it,  it  cannot  there  imprint  its  image,  and  where  the  falling 
ray  does  not  strike  it  does  not  produce  the  reflex  ray,  and  for  this  rea- 
son the  pupil  does  not  take  it.  And  so  it  will  happen  when  the  face  is 
lowered,  for  then  the  thick  part  of  the  upper  covering  of  the  eye  neither 
sees  nor  is  seen  by  that  luminous  body,  for  which  cause  the  image  as  has 
been  said  cannot  imprint  itself  there,  and  in  consequence  the  eye  can- 
not there  discern  what  is  not  there;  but  it  sees  this  image  in  the  lower 
covering,  and  this  lid  sees  and  is  seen  by  the  luminous  body,  and  thus 
we  have  proved  our  intent. 

The  adversary  says  that  the  ray  bends  because  it  goes  to  the  sense 
from  the  thin  to  the  dense.  d  9  v. 

The  images  of  the  objects  infused  in  the  opposite  air  are  all  in  all  this 
air  and  all  in  every  part  of  it.  This  is  proved: — 

Conception  of  the  objects.  All  that  air  sees  the  object  opposite  to  itself 
which  is  seen  by  the  same  object. 

This  is  proved  by  the  third  of  this  which  says  that  all  the  visions 
made  in  the  same  quality  of  air  are  rectilinear. 

Therefore  since  it  is  possible  to  draw  a  straight  line  from  the  eye  to 

1  The  words  in  italics  are  crossed  out  in  the  manuscript. 


23o  OPTICS 

each  part  of  the  air  seen  by  this  eye  this  vision  is  rectilinear.  And  this  is 
also  proved  by  what  Aristotle  says: — 'every  natural  action  is  made  in 
the  briefest  way  possible'.  The  vision  therefore  will  be  made  by  the 
shortest  line,  that  is  by  a  straight  line. 


OF  THE  IMAGES  OF  THE  OBJECTS  INFUSED  THROUGHOUT 

THE  AIR 

The  objects  have  their  images  infused  in  all  the  air  that  is  seen  by 
these  objects:  which  images  are  all  in  all  the  above-mentioned  air  and 
are  all  in  every  part  of  it. 

How  the  eye  does  not  know  the  boundary  of  any  body: 
The  eye  will  never  be  capable  of  [perceiving]  the  true  boundary  of 
the  figures  of  any  body  when  they  show  up  against  the  far  distance. 
This  may  be  proved:  let  a  b  be  the  pupil  of  the  eye  and  c  p  the  body 
placed  opposite  to  the  eye  of  which  we  have  noted  that  c  is  the  upper 
extremity,  and  let  n  m  be  the  background  against  which  this  extremity 
ought  to  be  perceived  by  the  eye.  I  maintain  that  it  is  not  possible  to 
ascertain  in  what  part  of  this  background  the  extremity  of  this  body 
terminates,  and  this  is  proved  by  the  help  of  the  third  [section]  of  this 
[treatise]  in  which  it  is  stated  that  the  faculty  of  vision  is  not  in  a 
point  as  the  painters  who  have  treated  of  perspective  would  have  us 
to  suppose,  but  is  all  in  the  whole  of  the  pupil  into  which  the  images 
of  the  objects  penetrate,  and  within  the  eye  in  a  larger  space  than  that 
occupied  by  this  pupil.  But  these  images  are  the  more  clearly  to  be 
perceived  in  proportion  as  they  are  nearer  to  the  centre  of  this  faculty 
[of  vision]  located  in  the  said  space  and  the  less  clearly  in  proportion 
as  they  are  farther  removed  from  this  centre. 

If  therefore  the  visual  faculty  a  b  takes  in  the  extremity  of  the  object 
c  the  centre  line  of  the  visual  faculty  r  sees  c  in  the  part  of  the  back- 
ground /,  and  the  upper  extremity  of  this  visual  faculty  that  is  s  sees  c 
in  the  background  h  and  the  lower  part  of  the  visual  faculty  sees  c  in 
the  background  d\  and  thus  it  goes  spreading  itself  through  the  whole 
background  d  h;  and  through  this  such  extremity  is  not  known  to  the 
eye  because  the  sense  of  the  visual  faculty  is  spread  through  all  this 
faculty  which  offers  to  the  judgment  a  vague  perception  of  this  ex-

this  centre  line  of  the  visual  faculty,  and  so  much  more  or  less  as  it  is 
more  remote  or  nearer  to  the  eye.  d  10  v. 

A  stone  thrown  through  the  air  leaves  in  the  eye  which  sees  it  the

OF  THE  NATURE  OF  SIGHT 

I  say  that  sight  is  exercised  by  all  animals  through  the  medium  of 
light;  and  if  against  this  any  one  should  instance  the  sight  of  nocturnal 
animals,  I  would  say  that  these  in  exactly  the  same  way  are  subject  to 
the  same  law  of  nature.  For,  as  one  may  readily  understand,  the  senses, 
when  they  receive  the  images  of  things,  do  not  send  forth  from  them- 
selves any  actual  power;  but  on  the  contrary  the  air  which  is  between 
the  object  and  its  sense,  serving  as  a  medium,  incorporates  within  itself 
the  images  of  things,  and  by  its  own  contact  with  the  sense  presents 
them  to  it,  if  the  objects  either  by  sound  or  smell  project  themselves  to 
the  eye  or  the  nose  by  virtue  of  their  incorporeal  powers.  Here  the  light 
is  not  necessary,  nor  is  it  made  use  of. 

The  forms  of  objects  do  not  enter  into  the  air  as  images  unless  they 
are  luminous;  this  being  so,  the  eye  cannot  receive  the  same  from  that 
air  which  does  not  contain  them,  but  only  touches  their  surface. 

If  you  wish  to  speak  of  the  many  animals  which  hunt  their  prey  by 
night,  I  answer  that  when  that  small  amount  of  light  sufficient  for 
them  to  see  their  way  fails  them,  they  avail  themselves  of  their  powers 
of  hearing  and  smell,  which  are  not  impeded  by  the  darkness,  and  in 
which  they  are  far  in  advance  of  man.  If  you  watch  a  cat  in  the  day- 
time leaping  among  a  lot  of  pieces  of  crockery  you  will  see  that  these 
will  remain  whole;  but  if  it  does  the  same  by  night  it  will  break  a  con- 
siderable number.  Night  birds  do  not  fly  unless  the  moon  is  shining 
either  full  or  in  part,  but  their  time  of  feeding  is  between  the  hour  of 
sunset  and  the  total  darkness  of  the  night. 

No  substance  can  be  comprehended  without  light  and  shade;  light 
and  shade  are  caused  by  light.  c.a.  90  r.  b

OF  THE  EYE 

Since  the  eye  is  the  window  of  the  soul,  the  latter  is  always  in  fear  of 
being  deprived  of  it,  to  such  an  extent  that  when  anything  moves  in 
front  of  it  which  causes  a  man  sudden  fear,  he  does  not  use  his  hands 
to  protect  his  heart,  which  supplies  life  to  the  head  where  dwells  the 
lord  of  the  senses,  nor  his  hearing,  nor  sense  of  smell  or  taste;  but  the 
affrighted  sense  immediately  not  contented  with  shutting  the  eyes  and 
pressing  their  lids  together  with  the  utmost  force,  causes  him  to  turn 
suddenly  in  the  opposite  direction;  and  not  as  yet  feeling  secure  he 
covers  them  with  the  one  hand  and  stretches  out  the  other  to  form  a 
screen  against  the  object  of  his  fear. 

Preamble  to  perspective — concerning  the  functions  of  the  eye: 
Consider  now,  O  Reader,  what  trust  can  we  place  in  the  ancients 
who  have  set  out  to  define  the  nature  of  the  soul  and  of  life, — things 
incapable  of  proof, — whilst  those  things  which  by  experience  may  al- 
ways be  clearly  known  and  proved  have  for  so  many  centuries  either 
remained  unknown  or  have  been  wrongly  interpreted. 

The  eye  which  thus  clearly  offers  proof  of  its  functions  has  even 
down  to  our  own  times  been  defined  by  countless  writers  in  one  way, 
but  I  find  by  experience  that  it  acts  in  another.  c.a.  119  v.  a 

All  the  images  of  the  things  set  over  against  the  eye  converge  in 
shining  lines  on  the  surface  of  the  eye;  and  these  intersect  on  the  sur- 
face of  the  eye  at  equal  angles. 

The  atmosphere  is  all  in  all  and  all  in  every  part  of  it  filled  with  the 
images  of  the  bodies  which  are  enclosed  within  it.  c.a.  120  r.  d 

I  find  by  experience  that  the  black  or  almost  black  fringe  of  colour 
(colore  crispo  ovver  rasposo)  which  appears  round  the  pupil  serves 
for  no  other  purpose  except  to  increase  or  diminish  the  size  of  this 
pupil;  to  increase  it  when  the  eye  is  looking  towards  a  dark  place; 
to  diminish  it  when  it  is  looking  at  the  light  or  at  a  luminous  thing. 

And  you  should  make  the  experiment  of  holding  a  light  near  to  the 
eye,  and  make  it  when  you  are  looking  into  the  darkness  and  then  turn 
the  eye  to  this  light,  and  you  will  be  convinced  by  this  experiment. 

c.a.  125  r.  a 


OPTICS  233 

If  the  object  in  front  of  the  eye  sends  its  image  to  it  the  eye  also 
Knds  its  image  to  the  object,  so  of  the  object  and  of  the  image  pro- 
ceeding  from  it  no  portion  is  lost  for  any  reason  either  in  the  eye  or  the 
object.  Therefore  we  can  sooner  believe  that  it  is  the  nature  and  power 
of  this  luminous  atmosphere  that  attracts  and  takes  into  itself  the 
images  of  the  objects  that  are  within  it  than  that  it  is  the  nature  of  the 
objects  which  transmits  their  images  through  the  atmosphere. 

If  the  object  in  front  of  the  eye  were  to  send  its  image  to  it  the  eye 
would  have  to  do  the  same  to  the  object,  whence  it  would  appear  that 
these  images  were  incorporeal  powers.  If  it  were  thus  it  would  be 
necessary  that  each  object  should  rapidly  become  less;  because  each 
body  appears  as  an  image  in  the  atmosphere  in  front  of  it,  that  is  the 
whole  body  in  the  whole  atmosphere  and  the  whole  in  the  part,  and  all 
the  bodies  in  the  whole  atmosphere  and  all  in  the  part,  referring  to 
that  portion  of  it  which  is  capable  of  receiving  into  itself  the  direct  and 
radiating  lines  of  the  images  transmitted  by  the  objects.  For  this  reason 
then  it  must  be  admitted  that  it  is  the  nature  of  this  atmosphere  which 
finds  itself  among  the  objects  to  draw  to  itself  like  a  magnet  the  images 
of  the  objects  among  which  it  is  situated. 

A  proof  how  all  the  objects  placed  in  one  position  are  all  in  the  whole 
of  it  and  all  in  each  part: 

I  maintain  that  if  the  front  of  a  building  or  some  piazza  or  field 
which  is  illuminated  by  the  sun  has  a  dwelling  over  against  it,  and  in 
that  part  of  the  front  which  does  not  face  the  sun  you  make  a  small 
round  hole,  all  the  objects  which  are  lit  by  the  sun  will  transmit  their 
images  through  this  hole,  and  will  be  visible  inside  the  dwelling  on 
the  opposite  wall  which  should  be  made  white.  And  they  will  be  there 
exactly,  but  inverted;  and  if  in  different  parts  of  the  same  wall  you 
make  similar  holes  you  will  produce  the  same  effect  in  each. 

Therefore  the  images  of  the  illuminated  objects  are  all  everywhere 
on  this  wall  and  all  in  each  of  its  smallest  parts.  The  reason  is  this:  we 
know  clearly  that  this  hole  ought  to  give  some  light  to  this  dwelling 
and  the  light  which  passes  through  it  is  caused  by  one  or  by  many 
luminous  bodies :  if  these  bodies  are  of  different  colours  and  shapes  the 
rays  which  make  their  images  will  be  of  different  colours  and  shapes 
and  so  also  will  be  the  representations  on  the  wall.  c.a.  135  v.  b

The  greater  the  spherical  body  the  less  is  the  proportion  of  itself  that

A  proof  of  the  manner  in  which  glasses  aid  the  sight: 
Let  a  b  be  the  glasses  and  c  d  the  eyes,  and  suppose  these  to  have 
grown  old.  Whereas  they  used  to  see  an  object  at  e  with  great  ease  by 
turning  their  position  very  considerably  from  the  line  of  the  optic 
nerves,  but  now  by  reason  of  age  the  power  of  bending  has  become 
weakened,  and  consequently  it  cannot  be  twisted  without  causing  great 
pain  to  the  eyes,  so  that  they  are  constrained  of  necessity  to  place  the 
object  farther  away,  that  is  from  e  to  /,  and  so  see  it  better  but  not  in 
detail.  But  through  the  interposition  of  the  spectacles  the  object  is 
clearly  discerned  at  the  distance  that  it  was  when  they  were  young,  that 
is  at  e,  and  this  comes  about  because  the  object  e  passes  to  the  eye 
through  various  mediums,  namely  thin  and  thick,  the  thin  being  the  air 
that  is  between  the  spectacles  and  the  object,  and  the  thick  being  the 
thickness  of  the  glass  of  the  spectacles,  the  line  of  direction  consequently 
bends  in  the  thickness  of  the  glass,  and  the  line  is  twisted,  so  that  see- 
ing the  object  at  e  it  sees  it  as  though  it  was  at  /,  with  the  advantage 
that  the  position  of  the  eye  with  regard  to  its  optic  nerves  is  not  strained 
and  it  sees  it  near  at  hand  and  discerns  it  better  at  e  than  at  /  and 
especially  the  minute  portions.  c.a.  244  r.  a 

In  just  such  proportion  as  the  eye  when  it  functions  is  nearer  than

I  say  that  the  power  of  vision  extends  by  means  of  the  visual  rays  as 
far  as  the  surface  of  bodies  which  are  not  transparent,  and  that  the 
power  possessed  by  these  bodies  extends  up  to  the  power  of  vision,  and 


OPTICS  235 

that  every  similar  body  fills  all  the  surrounding  air  with  its  image. 
Each  body  separately  and  all  together  do  the  same,  and  not  only  do 
they  fill  it  with  the  likeness  of  their  shape,  but  also  with  that  of  their 


Example 

You  see  with  the  sun  when  it  is  at  the  centre  of  our  hemisphere,  how 
there  are  images  of  its  form  in  all  the  parts  where  it  reveals  itself,  and 
you  see  how  in  all  these  same  places  there  are  also  the  images  of  its 
radiance,  and  to  these  must  also  be  added  the  image  of  the  power  of  its 
heat;  and  all  these  powers  proceed  from  the  same  source  by  means  of 
radiant  lines  which  issue  from  its  body  and  end  in  the  opaque  objects 
without  it  thereby  undergoing  any  diminution. 

The  north  star  remains  continually  with  the  images  of  its  power 
spread  out,  becoming  incorporated  not  only  in  thin  but  in  thick  bodies, 
in  those  transparent  and  those  opaque,  but  it  does  not  on  this  account 
suffer  any  loss  of  its  shape. 

Confutation 

Those  mathematicians,  then,  who  say  that  the  eye  has  no  spiritual 
power  which  extends  to  a  distance  from  itself,  since,  if  it  were  so,  it 
could  not  be  without  great  diminution  in  the  use  of  the  power  of 
vision,  and  that  though  the  eye  were  as  great  as  the  body  of  the  earth 
it  would  of  necessity  be  consumed  in  beholding  the  stars :  for  this  rea- 
son they  maintain  that  the  eye  takes  in  but  does  not  send  forth  any- 
thing from  itself. 

Example 

What  will  these  say  of  the  musk  which  always  keeps  a  great  quantity 
of  the  atmosphere  charged  with  its  odour,  and  which,  if  it  be  carried  a 
thousand  miles,  will  permeate  a  thousand  miles  with  that  thickness  of 
atmosphere  without  any  diminution  of  itself? 

Or  will  they  say  that  the  sound  which  the  bell  makes  on  its  contact 
with  the  clapper,  which  daily  of  itself  fills  the  whole  countryside  with 
its  sound,  must  of  necessity  consume  this  bell? 

Certainly,  it  seems  to  me,  there  are  such  men  as  these — and  that  is 
all  that  need  be  said  of  them.

If  you  take  a  light  and  place  it  in  a  lantern  tinted  green  or  other 
transparent  colours  you  will  see  by  experiment  that  all  the  objects 
which  are  illuminated  by  this  light  seem  to  take  their  colour  from  the 
lantern. 

You  may  have  also  seen  in  churches  how  the  light  which  comes 
through  stained-glass  windows  assumes  the  colour  of  the  glass  of  these 
windows.  If  this  does  not  convince  you,  watch  the  sun  at  its  setting 
when  it  shows  itself  red  through  the  vapour,  how  it  dyes  red  all  the 
clouds  which  take  their  light  from  the  sun. 


Opinions 

All  these  instances  are  given  in  order  to  prove  how  all  things  or 
certainly  many  things  transmit  the  appearance  of  their  powers  together 
with  the  image  of  their  form  without  any  injury  to  themselves;  and  this 
also  may  happen  with  the  power  of  the  eye. 


OPTICS  237 

Contrary  opinion 

Furthermore  if  anyone  wished  to  say  that  the  eye  was  not  adapted  to 
receive  like  the  ear  the  images  of  objects  without  transmitting  some 
potency  in  exchange  for  these,  this  may  be  proved  by  the  instance  of 
the  small  hole  made  in  a  window  which  gives  back  all  the  images  of 
the  bodies  which  are  opposite  to  it;  therefore  one  may  say  that  the  eye 
does  the  same. 

Refutation 

If  the  small  hole  cited  as  an  example  without  sending  forth  anything 
except  its  form  without  incorporeal  power  gives  back  to  the  house  the 
images  of  objects  in  their  colour  and  form  and  there  inverts  them,  the 
eye  would  have  to  do  the  same  so  that  everything  seen  would  appear 
there  inverted. 

Proof  to  the  contrary 

The  circle  of  the  light  which  is  in  the  middle  of  the  white  of  the  eye 
is  by  nature  suitable  to  apprehend  objects.  This  same  circle  has  in  it  a 
point  which  seems  black  and  this  is  a  nerve  bored  through  it  which 
goes  within  to  the  seat  of  the  powers  charged  with  the  power  of  receiv- 
ing impressions  and  forming  judgment,  and  this  penetrates  to  the 
common  sense.  Now  the  objects  which  are  over  against  the  eyes  act 
with  the  rays  of  their  images  after  the  manner  of  many  archers  who 
wish  to  shoot  through  the  bore  of  a  carbine,  for  the  one  among  them 
who  finds  himself  in  a  straight  line  with  the  direction  of  the  bore  of 
the  carbine  will  be  most  likely  to  touch  the  bottom  of  this  bore  with 
his  arrow;  so  the  objects  opposite  to  the  eye  will  be  more  transferred 
to  the  sense  when  they  are  more  in  the  line  of  the  transfixing  nerve. 

That  water  which  is  in  the  light  that  surrounds  the  black  centre  of 
the  eye  serves  the  same  purpose  as  the  hounds  in  the  chase,  for  these 
are  used  to  start  the  quarry  and  then  the  hunters  capture  it.  So  also 
with  this,  because  it  is  a  humour  that  derives  from  the  power  of  the 
imprensiva  and  sees  many  things  without  seizing  hold  of  them,  but 
suddenly  turns  thither  the  central  beam  which  proceeds  along  the  line 
to  the  sense,  and  this  seizes  on  the  images  and  confines  such  as  please 
it  within  the  prison  of  the  memory.  c.a.  270  r.  b 


238  OPTICS 

Why  objects  as  they  come  upon  the  small  surface  of  the  eye  appeal 
large  arises  from  the  fact  that  the  pupil  is  a  concave  mirror;  and 
one  sees  for  example  with  a  glass  ball  filled  with  water  that  anything 
placed  at  the  side  either  inside  or  outside  appears  larger. 

c.a.  309  r.  b 

Nothing  can  be  seen  that  does  not  transmit  its  image  through  the 
air. 

Therefore  nothing  that  is  spiritual  or  transparent  can  see  anything 
set  over  against  it,  for  this  requires  that  it  have  within  itself  a  thicl 
opaque  instrument  and  being  thus  it  is  not  termed  a  spirit. 

Prove  how  nothing  can  be  seen  except  through  a  small  flssun 
through  which  the  atmosphere  passes  filled  with  the  images  of  objects 
that  intersect  within  the  thick  and  opaque  sides  of  the  above-mentionec 
fissures.  And  for  this  reason  nothing  which  has  not  substance  ca] 
discern  either  the  shape  or  colour  of  any  object,  seeing  that  it  is  necej 
sary  that  there  should  be  a  thick  opaque  instrument  in  order  that 
through  the  fissure  in  it  the  images  of  the  objects  may  assume  theii 
colours  and  shapes.  c.a.  345  r.  b 

Seeing  that  the  images  of  the  objects  are  all  spread  throughout  al 
the  air  which  surrounds  them,  and  are  all  in  every  point  of  the  same 
it  must  be  that  the  images  of  our  hemisphere  enter  and  pass  togethei 
with  those  of  all  the  heavenly  bodies  through  the  natural  point  ii 
which  they  merge  and  become  united,  by  mutually  penetrating  an( 
intersecting  each  other,  whereby  the  image  of  the  moon  in  the  east  anc 
the  image  of  the  sun  in  the  west  at  this  natural  point  become  unitec 
and  blended  together  with  our  hemisphere.

Here  the  figures,  here  the  colours,  here  all  the  images  of  every  part

manifest  and  immediate,  as  are  the  images  which  have  passed  through

The  point  is  in  itself  an  indivisible  part,  separated  from  and  similar 
to  all,  and  possessing  the  capacity  of  all,  and  all  the  indivisible  parts  are 
similar  to  the  one  and  are  such  as  may  all  be  contained  in  that  one,  as 
is  shown  by  experience  in  the  points  of  the  angles  of  the  air-holes,  for 
when  the  solar  rays  have  passed  through  these  the  angles  become  the 
termination  and  point  of  the  primitive  and  derived  pyramid. 

This  derived  pyramid  although  of  less  force  is  none  the  less  capable 
of  going  a  long  way  enlarging  and  expanding  itself  with  the  concourse 
of  its  rays  much  more  than  the  primitive. 

And  this  same  phenomenon  may  be  seen  in  concave  mirrors,  for 
these  after  taking  the  solar  rays  according  to  their  capacity  lead  them 
in  pyramid  fashion  to  the  divisible  part  of  the  point,  and  although  it  is 
the  least  part  of  the  sun  or  rather  of  the  solar  rays  which  illumine  and 
warm  all  the  surface  of  the  mirror,  this  point  nevertheless  contains 
within  itself  the  whole  sum  and  power  whether  of  heat  or  radiance  of 
which  all  the  surface  of  the  mirror  is  capable.  The  derived  pyramid 
when  equal  in  bulk  is  similar  in  all  its  powers  to  the  primitive,  and 
when  this  equality  is  exceeded  it  becomes  so  much  weaker  in  propor- 
tion as  its  size  surpasses  the  bulk  of  the  primitive.  c.a.  347  r.  a

not  undergo  any  change.  That  is  that  if  you  look  at  this  light  at  a 
distance  of  one  or  two  braccia  from  the  aforesaid  hole  it  will  not 
undergo  any  change  whether  you  are  looking  at  it  through  this  hole

The  movement  of  an  object  near  to  a  stationary  object  often  causes

The  medium  that  is  between  the  eye  and  the  object  seen  transforms 
this  object  to  its  own  colour.  So  the  blueness  of  the  atmosphere  causes 
the  distant  mountains  to  seem  blue;  red  glass  causes  anything  that  the 
eye  sees  through  it  to  seem  red.  The  light  created  by  the  stars  round

PERSPECTIVE  AND  MOVEMENT 

Every  body  that  moves  rapidly  seems  to  colour  its  path  with  the 
impression  of  its  hue.  The  truth  of  this  proposition  is  seen  from  experi- 
ence; thus  when  the  lightning  moves  among  dark  clouds  the  speed  of 
its  sinuous  flight  makes  its  whole  course  resemble  a  luminous  snake. 
So  in  like  manner  if  you  wave  a  lighted  brand  its  whole  course  will 
seem  a  ring  of  flame.  This  is  because  the  organ  of  perception  acts  more 
rapidly  than  the  judgment.  a  26  v. 

Why  the  movement  of  water  although  slower  than  that  of  man 
always  seems  swifter: 

The  reason  of  this  is  that  if  you  look  at  the  movement  of  the  water 
your  eye  will  not  be  able  to  fix  on  anything,  but  its  action  is  as  that  of 
things  seen  in  your  shadow  when  you  are  walking;  for  if  the  eye  at- 
tempt to  distinguish  the  nature  of  the  shadow,  the  wisps  of  straw  or 
other  things  contained  in  it  appear  of  rapid  movement  and  it  seems 
that  these  are  much  more  swift  to  flee  from  the  said  shadow  than  the 
shadow  is  to  proceed.  a  58  v. 

If  the  eye  looks  at  the  light  of  a  candle  at  a  distance  of  four  hundred 
braccia,  this  light  will  appear  to  this  eye  which  looks  at  it  increased  a 
hundred  times  its  true  quantity;  but  if  you  place  a  stick  in  front  of  it 
somewhat  larger  than  this  light,  this  stick  which  would  appear  two 
braccia  wide  will  hide  it.  This  error  therefore  comes  from  the  eye  which 
takes  the  luminous  images  not  only  with  the  point  of  its  light  but  also 
with  the  whole  of  this  light,  and  of  this  I  will  define  the  reason  in 
another  place.  c  6  r. 

The  eye  will  retain  and  preserve  better  within  itself  the  images  of 
luminous  things  than  of  shaded  things. 

The  reason  is  that  the  eye  in  itself  is  completely  dark,  and  since  like 
amid  like  cannot  be  distinguished,  the  night  or  other  dark  things  can 
[not]  be  retained  or  recognised  by  the  eye.  The  light  is  entirely  con- 
trary, and  the  more  it  is  divided  the  more  it  tends  to  destroy  and

change  the  customary  darkness  of  the  eye  and  so  leaves  its  image 
imprinted.  c  7  v- 

A  rod  or  cord  in  rapid  oscillation  appears  to  be  double. 

This  occurs  when  a  knife  is  fastened,  and  the  top  of  it  is  forcibly 
pulled  to  one  side  and  released,  so  that  it  quivers  many  times.  The  same 
thing  happens  with  the  cord  of  a  lute  when  one  tests  it  to  see  if  it  is  a 
good  one.  The  double  movement  takes  place  because  when  the  move- 
ment extends  to  the  extremity  of  the  thing  moved  it  is  much  swifter 
at  this  extremity.  But  this  extremity  stops  and  turns  back  when  its 
desire  has  been  fulfilled,  and  as  the  pause  is  made  first  at  one  and  then 
at  the  other  extremity  of  the  movement,  the  eye  must  necessarily  take

why  a  false  cord  of  a  lute  makes,  as  it  quivers,  two  or  three  images  and

[The  effect  on  the  eye  of  sudden  light] 

The  eye  which  is  used  to  the  darkness  is  hurt  on  suddenly  beholding 
the  light  and  therefore  closes  quickly  being  unable  to  endure  the  light. 
This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  pupil  in  order  to  recognise  any  object 
in  the  darkness  to  which  it  has  grown  accustomed,  increases  in  size, 
employing  all  its  force  to  transmit  to  the  receptive  part  the  image  of 
things  in  shadow.  And  the  light,  suddenly  penetrating,  causes  too  large 
a  part  of  the  pupil  which  was  in  darkness  to  be  hurt  by  the  radiance 
which  bursts  in  upon  it,  this  being  the  exact  opposite  of  the  darkness 
to  which  the  eye  has  already  grown  accustomed  and  habituated,  and 
which  seeks  to  maintain  itself  there,  and  will  not  quit  its  hold  with- 
out inflicting  injury  upon  the  eye. 

One  might  also  say  that  the  pain  caused  to  the  eye  when  in  shadow 
by  the  sudden  light  arises  from  the  sudden  contraction  of  the  pupil, 
which  does  not  occur  except  as  the  result  of  the  sudden  contact  and 
friction  of  the  sensitive  parts  of  the  eye.  If  you  would  see  an  instance 
of  this,  observe  and  note  carefully  the  size  of  the  pupil  when  any  one 
is  looking  at  a  dark  place,  and  then  cause  a  candle  to  be  brought  be- 
fore it,  and  make  it  rapidly  approach  the  eye,  and  you  will  see  an 
instantaneous  contraction  of  the  pupil.  c  16  r.

First — The  pupil  of  the  eye  contracts  as  the  light  reflected  in  it 
increases. 

Second — The  pupil  of  the  eye  expands  as  the  brightness  of  day  or 
of  any  other  light  reflected  in  it  grows  less. 

Third — The  eye  sees  and  knows  objects  of  vision  with  greater  inten- 
sity when  the  pupil  is  more  dilated;  and  this  is  proved  in  the  case 
of  the  nocturnal  animals  such  as  cats  and  others,  and  birds  such  as 
the  owl  and  suchlike  in  which  the  pupil  undergoes  a  great  variation 
from  large  to  small  in  the  dark  and  in  the  light. 

Fourth — The  eye  when  placed  in  an  illuminated  atmosphere  can 
discern  the  darkness  within  the  windows  of  habitations  which  are 
themselves  in  light. 

Fifth — All  colours  when  placed  in  shadow  seem  to  be  equally  dark. 

Sixth — But  all  colours  placed  in  light  keep  their  essence  unchanged. 

e  17  v. 

If  the  object  interposed  between  the  background  and  the  eye  is  less 
than  the  pupil  of  the  eye  no  part  of  the  background  will  be  covered 
by  this  object.  f  28  v. 

The  rays  of  luminous  bodies  that  are  remote  from  the  eye  will  seem 
of  great  length,  because  no  object  which  sends  an  image  is  in  closer 
proximity  to  the  pupil  of  the  eye  than  the  object  imprinted  on  the  rim 
of  the  eye  which  touches  the  pupil  and  from  there  sends  the  image  to 
the  eye. 

The  rays  of  luminous  objects  will  seem  shorter  when  these  objects 
are  near  to  the  eye  than  when  they  are  far  away,  because,  if  the  lids  of 
the  eyes  are  half  closed  as  is  done  by  those  who  wish  to  see  rays  round 
the  light,  and  these  lids  occupy  little  space  below  and  above  this  light, 
and  the  rays  therefore  are  not  able  to  open  more  than  whatever  may 
be  this  space  seen  by  the  eye,  it  is  necessary  that  in  this  short  space  one 
sees  short  rays,  and  in  a  long  space  long  rays  as  is  shown  above 
[diagram],  f  29  r. 

How  the  rays  that  are  seen  around  a  luminous  body  in  contracting 
the  eyelids  are  produced  in  the  eyes  and  not  elsewhere: 


OPTICS  245 

Convex  mirrors  will  reflect  the  rays  that  they  receive  from  the  lumi- 
nous body  in  all  the  parts  that  see  the  mirror  where  the  luminous  body 
sees  it. 

The  luminous  body  sends  three  images  of  itself  to  the  eye,  of  which 
one  goes  straight  to  the  pupil;  the  other  two  strike  upon  the  convexity 
of  the  eyelids  and  from  there  leap  back  in  opposite  movements  to  the 
opposite  edges  of  the  eyes,  and  from  the  edges  they  leap  back  into  the 
eyeball  ('luce'),  and  join  themselves  below  and  above  to  the  first 
image,  with  the  brilliance  which  has  been  imprinted  on  the  eyelids  in 
the  form  of  rays;  and  the  luminous  body  does  this  when  the  eye  is 
drawn  together  as  when  one  takes  aim  at  a  target. 

This  is  proved: — let  the  eye  be  inclined  as  has  been  said  and  you  will 
see  two  groups  of  rays  around  the  luminous  separated  body,  of  which 
one  part  goes  upwards  and  the  other  downwards;  and  if  you  hold  your 
finger  up  against  the  light,  putting  it  crosswise  a  little  below  the  lumi- 
nous body,  and  raise  it  towards  the  light  with  a  slow  movement  until 
you  reach  the  origin  of  the  light  from  below,  and  then  observe  how 
instantly  this  luminous  body  will  lose  all  its  rays  above;  and  if  you 
make  a  contrary  movement  crosswise  with  your  finger,  commencing 
above  the  light,  and  with  slow  movement  lower  your  finger  until  it 
meets  the  summit  of  the  light,  you  will  then  see  that  all  the  rays  below 
are  lacking;  and  this  proves  our  proposition,  for  if  a  be  the  luminous 
body,  then  a  o  the  first  ray  from  its  centre  goes  straight  to  the  pupil 
of  the  eye,  that  below,  a  m,  strikes  upon  the  convexity  of  the  eyelids 
below  the  eyelashes,  and  makes  several  images,  and  these,  as  soon  as 
they  are  formed,  are  reflected  upon  the  lid  n,  which  forms  the  thick 
part  of  the  covering  of  the  eye;  and  from  there  it  leaps  back  into  the 
eyeball  ('luce'),  together  with  all  the  images  formed  in  the  hairs  of 
the  eyelids,  and  these  are  somewhat  long  and  are  separated  and  pro- 
ceed with  points  raised  spreading  themselves  out  towards  the  extremi- 
ties as  do  the  real  eyelashes. 

Now  to  bring  our  purpose  to  a  conclusion,  I  call  t  s  the  part  between 
the  commencement  of  the  light  and  your  eye;  you  will  cut  the  ray  a  m, 
consequently,  because  of  this  the  ray  will  not  make  its  impression  on 
the  convexities  or  curves  of  the  eyelids  below,  and  therefore  the  ray 
above  will  cease  at  n  and  consequently  in  the  eyeball  ('luce'),  for  if 
the  cause  of  the  images  m  be  lacking  the  effects  of  the  rays  m  n  will 


246  OPTICS 

be  lacking.  Here  then  is  the  explanation  of  why  when  the  ray  is  cover- 
ing the  light  below,  the  ray  above  is  lost  altogether. 

The  adversary  here  says  that  it  seems  to  him  that  this  image  proceeds 
from  the  luminous  body  and  passes  between  the  eyelids  and  imprints 
itself  on  the  thick  part  of  the  edges  of  the  eyelids,  and  that  from  there 
they  leap  to  the  pupil,  and  that  this  image  emits  rays  because  it  is 
divided  by  the  hairs  through  which  it  passes. 

To  this  the  reply  is  that  in  this  event  whatever  might  fill  the  image 
below  the  rays  above  would  not  fail.  f  30  r.  and  29  v. 

There  is  the  same  proportion  one  with  another  between  the  spaces 
that  there  are  between  the  images  of  the  stars  upon  the  surface  of  the 
eye  and  that  of  the  spaces  interposed  between  the  stars  of  the  heaven. 

Although  the  images  of  the  stars  may  be  all  in  all  the  surface  of  the 
eye  and  all  in  each  of  its  parts,  and  each  image  may  be  superimposed 
upon  each  of  the  other  images  as  it  appears  to  another  eye  which  re- 
gards it  after  the  manner  of  the  surface  of  a  mirror,  it  remains  none  the 
less  the  fact  that  from  the  inner  side  of  the  pupil  which  covers  for  it 
the  arrival  from  without  of  an  image  of  the  star,  this  image  will  not 
turn  to  imprint  itself  in  another  part  of  the  eye  but  will  remain  with- 
out impression  in  the  eye,  because  the  spot  to  which  it  directed  itself 
is  impeded  by  the  aforesaid  interposition.  f  31  v. 

The  images  of  opaque  bodies  do  not  superimpose  themselves  one 
upon  another  when  the  eye  that  scrutinises  them  is  without  move- 
ment. 

In  the  same  mirror  or  pupil  is  the  image  of  all  the  objects  placed 
before  it,  and  each  of  these  objects  is  all  in  the  whole  surface  of  the 
mirror  and  all  in  each  of  its  smallest  parts. 

There  is  an  example  of  this  in  the  movement  of  the  eye;  if  it  sees 
the  moon  with  all  the  stars  in  this  mirror,  and  marks  them  on  its  sur- 
face, and  then  the  eye  moves  a  little,  it  will  be  able  to  distinguish  them 
so  many  times  upon  this  mirror,  clearly  marked  one  above  the  other, 
and  this  it  will  be  able  to  do  an  infinite  number  of  times.  f  32  r. 

The  whole  pupil  of  the  eye  which  with  each  of  these  circles  from  the 
greater  to  the  less  goes  diminishing  an  infinite  number  of  times  can 


OPTICS  247 

see  the  whole  body  of  the  star;  but  it  will  see  it  as  much  smaller  as  it 
sees  it  with  a  less  expansion. 

Why  in  Looking  at  the  heaven  one  sees  many  stars  of  great  radiance, 
and  in  looking  at  them  through  a  very  minute  hole  made  in  a  sheet  of 
paper  placed  in  contact  with  the  eye  you  see  again  the  same  number 
ot  stars  but  they  will  be  much  diminished.  f  32  v. 

OF  THE  FACULTY  OF  SIGHT 

If  all  the  images  which  come  to  the  eye  met  in  an  angle,  by  the 
definition  of  the  angle  they  meet  in  a  mathematical  point  which  is 
proved  to  be  indivisible;  then  all  things  seen  in  the  universe  would 
seem  one  and  that  would  be  indivisible,  and  there  would  be  no  more 
space  from  one  star  to  another  which  would  be  reckoned  in  such  an 
angle. 

And  if  experience  shows  us  all  things  separated  with  spaces  pro- 
portioned and  definite,  this  power  which  imprints  the  images  of  objects 
is  also  itself  divisible  into  as  many  larger  and  smaller  parts  as  there  are 
images  of  the  things  seen.  We  conclude  therefore  that  the  sense  takes 
the  images  which  are  reflected  on  the  surface  of  the  eye,  and  then 
judges  them  within,  and  therefore  they  do  not  meet  in  a  point  nor  as 
a  consequence  in  an  angle. 

Every  surface  of  a  transparent  body  both  within  and  without  is 
formed  fitted  to  receive  the  images  of  its  objects. 

In  no  part  of  transparent  bodies  enclosed  by  their  surfaces  is  there 
lacking  the  power  to  receive  or  create  some  image,  but  each  is  well 
fitted  to  afford  a  passage  to  the  images  of  the  surface.  f  34  r. 

That  luminous  body  will  show  itself  of  less  size  at  the  same  distance 
which  loses  more  of  its  radiance. 

This  is  shown  by  an  iron  rod  heated  through  part  of  its  length  when 
in  a  dark  place;  although  it  is  of  uniform  thickness,  it  appears  to  be 
considerably  bigger  in  the  heated  part,  and  the  more  so  as  it  is  more 
heated.  The  reason  for  this  follows: — 

Every  luminous  body  makes  visible  rays  in  the  image  which  it  trans- 
mits to  the  eye;  and  the  rays  are  so  much  longer  as  it  is  of  greater 
brilliance;  and  so  conversely.  f  37  r. 


248  OPTICS 

Many  are  the  times  that  the  images  of  one  and  the  same  luminous 
body  will  be  two  or  three  times  at  the  same  time  in  the  same  eye. 

They  will  be  twice  there  when  the  eye  closes  somewhat  as  it  does 
when  it  looks  at  light  which  is  too  strong  and  when  the  head  is  some- 
what bending  as  in  the  figure  a,  in  this  case  it  makes  two  rays;  one 
strikes  against  the  humid  circumference  of  the  lower  eyelid  and  then 
leaps  back  to  the  pupil,  and  the  other  ray  goes  straight  to  this  pupil; 
it  will  recur  three  times  as  in  the  figure  b,  one  on  the  eyelid  above,  one 
on  that  below  and  one  in  the  centre  of  the  pupil.  And  the  aforesaid 
two  or  three  images  of  the  light  arriving  at  the  same  sense  appear  one 
single  image,  but  greater  than  corresponds  to  the  image  of  the  same 
body  which  transmits  to  the  two  eyes  two  images,  and  the  sense  takes 
them  for  one  single  image.  f  36   v.  and  37   r. 

As  regards  the  pupil  of  the  eyes  of  all  animals  both  those  of  the  land 
and  those  of  the  water,  nature  has  so  ordained  that  when  they  are 
affected  by  greater  or  less  brightness  the  pupil  that  is  the  black  portion 
of  the  eye  contracts  or  expands.  This  happens  because  as  the  excess  of 
brightness  causes  a  change  in  the  eye  the  eye  or  pupil  closes  up  after 
the  manner  of  a  purse,  consequently  the  great  brightness  becomes  small 
in  size  and  in  splendour  in  proportion  to  its  contraction  or  diminution. 
When  these  pupils  are  in  darkness  they  become  large  and  the  bright- 
ness is  diminished;  in  this  way  it  comes  about  that  they  increase  ac- 
cording to  the  increase  of  this  brightness,  and  so  the  quantity  of  the 
objects  seen  by  such  a  pupil  is  increased. 

And  this  supplies  a  reason  why  when  the  light  of  a  candle  is  removed 
farther  away  from  the  eye,  this  light  having  thereby  its  brightness 
diminished  the  pupil  increases  and  it  causes  the  figure  of  the  light  to 
increase.  f  39  v. 

The  image  of  the  sun  imprinted  on  the  surface  of  the  water  creates 
rays  which  shine  over  a  great  distance  both  within  and  outside  the 
water  as  though  it  was  a  real  light. 

Why  when  the  image  of  the  light  of  the  candle  diminishes  upon  the 
eyeball  when  this  candle  is  removed  to  a  great  distance  from  this  eye 
it  does  not  diminish  in  the  judgment  of  the  spectators  except  in  degree 
of  radiance.  f  40  r.

OPTICS  249 

The  eye  contracts  and  diminishes  the  pupil  to  such  an  extent  in 
looking  at  luminous  things  that  when  afterwards  looking  at  things  of 
less  radiance  they  appear  shaded. 

It  the  eye  which  has  been  in  a  shaded  place  should  then  see  objects 
of  only  a  moderate  degree  of  brightness  they  will  appear  extremely 
bright. 

And  the  reason  of  this  is  that  the  pupil  increases  so  much  while  in 
the  dark  places  that  it  afterwards  sees  objects  of  a  moderate  degree  of 
brightness  incorrectly.  f  50  r. 

In  every  spot  in  which  the  sun  sees  the  water  the  water  also  sees  the 
sun,  and  in  each  of  its  parts  it  can  present  the  sun's  image  to  the  eye. 

f  61  v. 

If  you  bring  your  eye  as  near  as  you  can  to  the  surface  of  the  sea 
you  will  see  the  image  of  the  sun  in  a  wave  of  the  water,  and  you  will 
be  able  to  measure  it  and  you  will  find  that  it  is  very  small. 

If  you  bring  your  eye  near  the  surface  of  the  water  of  the  sea  or  of  a 
pool  which  is  between  your  eye  and  the  sun  you  will  find  that  the 
image  of  the  sun  on  this  surface  shows  itself  very  small.  But  if  you 
retire  a  distance  of  several  miles  from  this  sea  you  will  perceive  a  pro- 
portionate increase  in  the  image  of  the  sun;  and  if  the  first  image 
preserves  the  true  shape  and  radiance  of  the  sun  as  do  mirrors,  the 
second  does  not  keep  either  the  shape  or  the  radiance  of  the  sun  but 
is  a  figure  with  broken  contour  lines  and  a  lesser  degree  of  radiance. 

The  figure  of  the  image  with  contour  lines  broken  and  confused  is 
formed  by  the  blending  of  many  images  of  the  sun  reflected  to  your  eye 
by  many  waves  of  the  sea,  and  the  lesser  degree  of  radiance  springs 
from  the  fact  that  the  shadowed  and  luminous  images  of  the  waves 
come  to  the  eye  all  mingled  together  and  consequently  their  light  is 
affected  by  their  shadows. 

This  however  cannot  happen  with  the  surface  of  a  single  wave  when 
you  have  approached  very  near  to  it  with  your  eye.  f  63  v. 

The  image  of  the  sun  in  the  convex  mirror  increases  as  it  recedes

Show  first  how  every  light  remote  from  the  eye  makes  rays  which 


250  OPTICS 

appear  to  increase  the  figure  of  this  luminous  body;  and  from  this  it 
follows  that  .  .  . 

The  eye  does  not  diminish  its  light  at  any  distance,  because  the 
image  of  the  light  which  imprints  itself  on  the  surface  of  the  eye 
illuminates  within  as  do  the  windows  of  paper,  which  diffuse  the  light 
taken  by  them  through  those  places  which  see  this  paper,  and  which  at 
first  could  not  see  the  cause  of  the  illumination  of  this  paper  when  the 
paper  was  not  there.  The  sun  also  on  being  reflected  in  the  mirrors 
causes  the  image  without  passing  within  to  be  reflected  outwardly  as 
though  it  were  a  real  light;  and  if  the  lead  were  not  behind  this  glass 
of  the  mirror,  the  image  of  the  sun  which  imprints  itself  on  the  surface 
of  the  glass  would  pass  within  and  cast  its  light  within  or  behind  this 
mirror.  And  thus  does  the  eye  which  receives  within  the  light  of  this 
image  and  spreads  it  considerably  in  the  visual  faculty.  f  94  v. 

[Distant  lights  and  reflection] 

Why  as  the  image  of  the  light  of  the  candle  diminishes  when  it  is 
removed  to  a  great  distance  from  the  eye  the  size  of  this  light  does  not 
diminish  but  it  lacks  only  the  power  and  brightness  of  its  radiance. 

A  light  that  is  less  in  quantity  is  less  also  in  illuminating  power,  but 
in  that  it  does  not  change  its  position  it  does  not  lose  its  first  quantity 
of  radiance  in  all  the  places  where  it  formerly  shone.  This  is  proved: 
the  light  of  the  sun  given  to  the  surface  of  the  water  is  reflected  back 
and  emits  rays  as  though  it  were  a  material  light  both  within  and 
without,  and  actually  illuminates  the  objects  set  over  against  it  and 
also  those  within.  f  95  r.

Why  when  men  are  somewhat  advanced  in  years  they  see  better  at

Sight  is  better  at  a  distance  than  near  at  hand  with  men  who  are 
somewhat  advanced  in  years  because  the  same  thing  transmits  a  smaller 
impression  of  itself  to  the  eye  when  it  is  remote  than  when  it  is  near.

Man  and  owl] 

All  things  seen  will  appear  larger  at  midnight  than  at  midday  and 
larger  in  the  morning  than  at  midday. 

This  takes  place  because  the  pupil  of  the  eye  is  considerably  smaller 
at  midday  than  at  any  other  time. 

To  just  such  extent  as  the  eye  or  pupil  of  the  owl  is  greater  in 
proportion  to  the  creature  than  is  that  of  man  it  sees  more  light  at  night 
than  man  does;  as  a  consequence  at  midday  it  sees  nothing  unless  its 
pupil  grows  smaller  and  in  the  same  way  at  night  it  sees  things  larger 
than  by  day.  h  86  [38]   r. 

The  larger  the  pupil  the  larger  will  be  the  appearance  of  the  objects 
it  sees. 

This  is  evident  when  we  look  at  luminous  and  especially  at  heavenly 
bodies.  When  the  eye  emerges  from  the  darkness  and  suddenly  looks  at 
these  bodies  they  will  appear  larger  at  first  and  will  then  diminish.  And 
if  you  look  at  these  bodies  through  a  small  hole  you  will  see  them 
smaller  because  a  smaller  part  of  the  pupil  is  functioning  in  this  act. 

h  88  [40]  r. 

When  the  eye  emerging  from  darkness  suddenly  sees  a  luminous 
body  it  will  appear  much  larger  at  the  first  glance  than  as  it  goes  on 
looking  at  it. 

A  luminous  body  will  seem  larger  and  more  luminous  when  seen 
with  both  eyes  than  when  seen  with  one. 

This  luminous  body  will  appear  of  less  size  when  it  is  seen  by  the 
eye  through  a  smaller  hole.

Example  of  the  enlargement  and  contraction  of  the  pupil  through 
the  movement  of  the  sun  or  other  luminous  body: 

The  darker  the  sky  the  greater  the  stars  will  seem,  and  if  you  light 
up  the  atmosphere  these  stars  will  show  themselves  less.  And  this 
change  proceeds  only  from  the  pupil  which  expands  and  contracts  ac- 
cording to  the  clearness  of  the  atmosphere  which  finds  itself  between 
the  eye  and  the  luminous  body.  Let  the  experiment  be  made  with  a 
candle  placed  above  the  head  while  you  are  looking  at  this  star;  after- 
wards proceed  to  lower  this  candle,  little  by  little,  until  it  is  near  the 
ray  that  comes  from  the  star  to  the  eye,  and  you  will  then  see  the  star 
diminish  so  much  that  you  will  almost  lose  sight  of  it.  119  v. 

The  pupil  of  the  eye  in  the  open  air  varies  its  size  with  every  degree 
of  the  sun's  movement.  And  as  it  varies  its  size  the  same  object  when 
seen  by  it  will  appear  of  different  sizes,  although  it  often  happens  that 
the  comparison  with  surrounding  things  does  not  allow  this  change  to 
be  discerned  when  you  look  at  a  particular  object.  1  20  r.

The  more  nearly  an  object  approaches  to  the  eye  the  more  it  shows

the  eye  it  shows  itself  less  in  shape.  1  49  [1]  v.

[The  structure  and  anatomy  of  the  eye] 

The  pupil  of  the  eye  is  situated  in  the  centre  in  the  eyeball  ('luce') 
which  is  of  the  shape  of  part  of  a  sphere  which  takes  the  pupil  at  the 
centre  of  its  base.  This  'luce'  forming  part  of  a  sphere  takes  all  the 
images  of  the  objects  and  transmits  them  by  the  pupil  within  to  the 
place  where  the  vision  is  formed. 

In  the  anatomy  of  the  eye,  in  order  to  be  able  to  see  the  inside  well 
without  spilling  its  watery  humour,  you  should  place  the  complete  eye 
in  white  of  egg  and  make  it  boil  and  become  solid,  cutting  the  egg  and 
the  eye  transversely  so  that  no  part  of  the  middle  portion  may  be 
poured  out.  k  119  [39]  r. 

[Optical  illusions.  A  brand  of  fire] 

There  is  as  much  to  move  the  eye  when  the  luminous  object  remains 
fixed  as  there  is  to  move  this  object  when  the  eye  remains  fixed. 

What  is  said  in  the  first  part  is  proved  by  the  past,  and  I  will  prove 
the  second  part  by  the  help  of  this  same  past. 

For  if  when  the  eye  is  fixed  you  draw  a  brand  of  fire  in  a  circle  or 
from  below  the  eye  upward  this  brand  will  seem  to  be  a  line  of  fire 
which  rises  upwards  from  below,  and  yet  this  brand  cannot  actually  be 
in  more  than  one  part  of  this  line  at  one  time. 

And  in  the  same  way  if  this  brand  remain  fixed  and  the  eye  move 
downward  from  above  it  will  appear  to  this  eye  that  the  brand  is  rising 
up  from  below  in  a  continuous  line.  k  119  [39]  v. 

[Optical  illusions.  Brands  of  fire.  Stars] 

If  the  eye  that  looks  at  the  star  turns  swiftly  in  an  opposite  direction, 
it  will  appear  to  it  that  this  star  forms  itself  into  a  curving  line  of  fire. 
[Diagram  ] 

Let  a  b  c  be  the  eyeball  ('luce')  of  the  eye  which  looks  at  the  star  d; 
I  maintain  that  if  the  eyeball  moves  the  part  a  rapidly  to  c  then  b  in 
coming  to  the  place  a  will  take  the  appearance  of  a  continuous  line  of 
the  colour  of  the  star.  And  this  occurs  because  the  eye  preserves  for  a 
certain  space  of  time  the  image  of  the  thing  that  shines,  and  because 
this  impression  of  the  radiance  of  the  star  is  more  enduring  in  the 
pupil  than  was  the  time  of  its  movement,  this  impression  continues  to- 
gether with  the  movement  in  all  the  positions  which  pass  opposite  to 
the  star.  k  120  [40]  r. 


254  OPTICS 

When  the  eye  changes  its  position  which  has  been  fixed  in  relation 
to  a  near  object  it  will  seem  to  it  that  distant  objects  are  very  rapid  and 
that  the  first  is  without  movement  and  that  the  star  moves  by  the  line 
of  the  eye. 
[Diagram] 

Let  us  say  that  the  eye  a  has  fixed  its  range  of  vision  upon  the  object 
c  and  that  while  having  its  vision  fixed  upon  c  it  itself  moves  actually 
from  a  to  b\  the  star  d  when  seen  by  the  lines  of  the  eye  other  than  the 
central  ones  will  appear  to  it  very  swift,  and  in  the  time  during  which 
the  eye  goes  from  a  to  b,  the  star  will  appear  to  it  to  have  moved  the 
whole  part  of  the  sky  d  e.  k  122  [42]  v. 

But  if  the  eye  which  changes  its  position  keeps  its  vision  fixed  upon 
the  star  it  will  seem  to  it  that  all  the  objects  seen  on  the  lines  that  are 
not  central  are  fleeting  and  vanish  away  in  movement  contrary  to  that 
of  the  eye. 
[Diagram] 

Let  us  say  that  the  eye  b  having  its  vision  fixed  upon  the  star  d  e 
itself  moves  actually  from  £  to  a;  it  will  then  appear  to  the  eye  that  as 
its  lines  which  are  not  central  have  exchanged  so  many  times  the 
images  of  the  object  c  it  will  be  moved  in  a  direction  contrary  to  that  of 
the  eye  from  n  to  c.  k  122  [42]  r. 

In  proportion  as  a  thing  that  descends  shall  descend  from  a  higher 
position  it  will  appear  at  the  beginning  of  its  movement  to  be  obliged 
to  descend  nearer  to  the  eye  that  sees  it  than  does  a  thing  that  descends 
from  a  low  position. 
[Diagram] 

This  which  has  been  said  springs  from  the  background  of  the  mova- 
ble thing,  which  is  the  sky  where  this  movable  thing  shows  up  promi- 
nently, and  the  lower  the  movable  thing  upon  this  background  the 
more  does  the  eye  see  it  on  a  more  distant  background;  as  if  the  eye 
p  sees  the  movable  thing  at  e  and  sees  it  occupy  the  part  of  the  sky  d 
which  seems  almost  above  it;  and  if  it  sees  the  movable  thing  below 
at  /;  this  eye  sees  it  occupy  the  part  of  the  sky  a,  and  in  proportion  as 
the  distance  is  from  a  to  d  so  to  the  eye  p  it  seems  that  it  has  it  more  at 
the  zenith  when  at  e  than  at  /z,  that  is  that  when  falling  from  d  it  seems 
to  it  that  it  ought  to  fall  nearer  than  when  falling  from  a.

OPTICS  255 

Ii  the  proportion  of  the  movement  of  two  movable  things  is  the  same 
as  that  of  their  distance  from  the  eye  in  the  same  direction  the  move- 
ments of  these  movable  things  will  always  appear  equal  although  they 
may  be  of  almost  infinite  diversity. 

If  half  the  diameter  of  the  base  of  a  pyramid  measures  three-quarters 
of  its  hypotenuse  nothing  can  remain  stable  upon  the  said  hypotenuse; 
but  if  this  should  be  longer  it  will  support  anything,     k.  123  [43]  v. 

Among  the  things  of  equal  movement  that  will  appear  swifter  which 
is  nearer,  and  the  thing  will  seem  slower  which  is  more  remote. 
[Diagram] 

Because  everything  that  moves  is  seen  on  the  field  where  it  ends,  and 
the  distant  thing  in  like  movement  to  that  of  the  near  thing  will  oc- 
cupy less  of  the  field  than  this  near  thing  in  the  same  time,  for  which 
cause  occupying  a  greater  space  of  field  it  appears  so  much  swifter  as 
the  field  that  it  has  covered  is  greater.  k  124  [44]  r. 

\ Spherical  bodies] 

If  the  spherical  body  is  equal  to  the  pupil  that  sees  it  even  though 
it  may  be  at  infinite  varieties  of  distances,  provided  that  it  can  be  de- 
fined and  that  the  eye  is  able  to  discern  it  it  will  never  be  seen  as  more 
or  less  than  half.  And  this  happens  because  its  diameter  with  its  ex- 
tremities always  terminates  within  equal  angles  between  parallel  visual 
lines. 

But  if  the  pupil  be  less  than  the  spherical  body  situated  in  front  of 
it  it  will  never  at  any  variety  of  distance  be  able  to  see  the  half;  and  it 
will  see  as  much  less  in  proportion  as  it  is  nearer  to  it,  and  as  much 
more  as  it  is  more  remote.  k  124  [44]  v. 

An  object  less  than  the  pupil  placed  before  the  eye  will  not  cover  up 
any  distant  object  for  this  pupil. 

No  spherical  body  less  than  the  pupil  will  ever  be  seen  by  a  single 
pupil  without  it  seeing  more  than  half  of  it  although  it  be  at  whatever 
distance  it  may  wish.  And  it  will  see  so  much  more  of  it  as  the  medium 
is  nearer  and  so  much  less  as  it  is  more  remote  from  the  eye  that 
sees  it.  k  125  [45]  r. 

[Movements] 

In  the  cases  of  the  movement  of  the  thing  between  the  eye  and  the 
perforation  of  the  paper  you  have  to  make  the  perforations  with  very 


256  OPTICS 

small  holes  and  to  pull  the  thing  which  moves  as  thin  as  a  wisp  of 
straw,  and  in  the  movement  to  touch  yourself  with  it  on  the  eyelashes, 
the  paper  in  front  to  be  a  quarter  of  a  braccio  distant  from  the  eye  and 
the  air  to  be  visible  through  the  openings.  Furthermore  if  you  approach 
nearer  to  the  paper  so  that  the  eyelashes  almost  touch,  and  move  the 
face  at  d  to  right  and  left,  with  a  short  movement,  you  will  see  that  the 
hairs  appear  to  be  moving  beyond  this  hole  in  a  contrary  direction  to 
the  movement  made  by  your  eye.  But  if  the  movement  of  the  object  is 
beyond  the  perforated  paper  the  eye  will  then  see  the  true  movement  of 
the  object.  k  125  [45]  v.  and  126  [46]  r. 

[Contrary  movements  seen  at  the  same  time] 

Again  it  is  possible  for  the  same  pupil  to  see  the  same  object  at  the 
same  time  make  two  opposite  movements  without  the  pupil  changing. 
[Diagram  ] 

That  which  is  set  forth  above  is  seen  by  the  pupil  when  it  sees 
through  a  small  hole  made  in  the  paper  by  the  point  of  a  needle,  and 
keeping  the  eye  close  to  it  and  interposing  between  the  eye  and  the 
hole  a  very  fine  straw,  which  as  you  move  it  from  right  to  left  your 
eye  will  see  in  its  true  movement  between  the  hole  and  it,  in  the  true 
position  in  which  this  straw  actually  finds  itself  moving;  and  beyond 
this  hole  it  will  see  it  moving  in  the  opposite  direction  to  its  true  move- 
ment; so  that  at  one  and  the  same  time  it  sees  the  true  and  the  false 
movements  separately  the  one  from  the  other.  k  127  [47]  r. 

[Visual  faculty] 

And  the  reason  of  this  is  that  as  every  vision  transmits  itself  by  a 
straight  line  if  the  medium  be  uniform,  the  part  a  of  the  pupil  sees  0 
beyond  the  hole  at  s,  and  it  would  be  impossible  to  see  it  through  this 
hole  at  q  through  a  b  q,  that  is  by  a  line  that  is  not  straight.  Suppose 
now  that  o  is  lowered  to  n;  p  will  see  o  at  r,  and  if  o  is  lowered  as  far 
as  m  then  o  will  appear  to  the  lower  part  of  the  eye  c  to  be  raised  to  the 
extremity  q. 

The  pupil  which  sees  beyond  the  hole  something  smaller  than  itself 
and  near  to  it,  will  see  with  the  right  part  of  the  pupil  the  left  part  of 
the  object,  and  with  the  left  part  it  will  see  the  right  part  of  this  object; 
and  with  the  centre  of  the  pupil  it  will  see  the  centre  of  the  surface  of 


OPTICS  257 

the  object,  given  that  it  is  visible  and  that  the  centre  of  the  pupil  has  in 
itself  visual  faculty.  k  126  [46]  v. 

PUPIL  SEEING  AN  OBJECT  TWICE 

It  is  possible  for  the  same  pupil  to  see  the  same  object  twice,  in  two 
places  at  the  same  time. 
[Diagram] 

The  lower  part  b  of  the  pupil  a  b  sees  the  object  c  cover  d,  and  the 
upper  part  a  of  the  same  pupil  sees  the  same  object  c  cover  the  wall  g  /, 
beyond  the  hole  e,  in  the  position  g. 

Therefore  the  object  c  is  seen  at  the  same  time  at  d  and  g,  and  it  is 
this  that  I  wished  to  demonstrate.  k  127  [47]  v. 

As  the  light  diminishes  so  the  pupil  of  the  eye  that  beholds  this  light 
expands.  Therefore  the. eye  which  looks  through  a  pea-shooter  has  a 
larger  pupil  than  the  other,  and  sees  the  object  larger  and  clearer  than 
the  other  eye  does.  You  may  make  a  proof  of  this  if  you  look  with  both 
eyes  at  a  white  line  against  a  black  background,  one  looking  at  it 
through  a  pea-shooter  and  the  other  through  the  luminous  air. 

l  13  v.  and  14  r. 

When  the  eye  in  the  luminous  air  is  looking  at  a  place  that  is  in 
shadow  this  space  will  seem  of  much  greater  darkness  than  it  is. 

This  happens  simply  because  the  eye  which  is  in  the  air  diminishes 
its  pupil  the  more  as  the  air  which  reflects  it  is  more  luminous;  and  as 
the  pupil  becomes  more  contracted  so  the  thing  seen  by  it  shows  itself 
less  luminous. 

But  when  the  eye  enters  into  any  shaded  spot  immediately  the  ob- 
scurity of  this  shaded  spot  will  appear  to  diminish. 

This  takes  place  because  in  proportion  as  the  pupil  enters  into  the 
more  shaded  air  so  its  outline  increases  and  this  increase  causes  the 
great  darkness  to  seem  to  diminish.  l  41  v.

Here  let  us  treat  of  actual  movements  because  as  regards  spiritual 
movements  there  has  been  some  treatment  by  others. 

Actual  movement  made  with  swift  impetus  will  never  conceal  from 
the  eye  the  object  which  is  behind  the  body  that  is  moving,  if  only  it 
be  near  to  the  eye  and  not  too  much  greater  than  this  eye.  As  would 
be  the  movement  of  certain  instruments  worked  by  women,  made  for 
convenience  of  gathering  their  threads  together,  which  are  called 
'winders'  ('arcolai')  among  the  Florentines  and  by  the  Lombards 
'turrets'  ('bicocche').  For  these  in  their  revolving  movement  are  so 
swift  that  through  being  perforated  they  do  not  obstruct  to  the  eye 
anything  behind  them.  Forster  11  101  r.

Necessity  has  provided  that  all  the  images  of  bodies  set  over  against 
the  eye  intersect  in  two  places,  of  which  the  one  intersection  is  formed 
within  in  the  pupil  the  other  within  in  the  crystalline  sphere;  and  if 
this  were  not  the  case  the  eye  would  not  be  able  to  see  so  great  a  num- 
ber of  things  as  it  does.  This  is  proved  because  all  the  lines  that  inter- 
sect form  this  intersection  at  a  point,  since  of  bodies  nothing  is  visible 
except  their  surfaces,  the  edges  of  which  are  lines  by  the  converse  of  the 
definition  of  the  surface,  and  every  smallest  part  of  the  line  is  equal  to 
a  point,  because  smallest  is  said  of  that  thing  than  which  nothing  else 
can  be  smaller,  and  this  definition  is  like  that  of  the  point.  It  is  possible 
therefore  for  the  whole  circumference  of  a  circle  to  transmit  its  image 
to  its  intersection  as  is  shown  in  the  fourth  [section]  of  this  [treatise] 
which  says : — all  the  smallest  parts  of  the  images  penetrate  one  another 
without  occupation  one  of  another.  These  demonstrations  are  as  an  ex- 
ample of  the  eye : — no  image  of  however  small  a  body  enters  within  the 
eye  without  being  turned  upside  down,  and  as  it  penetrates  the  crystal- 
line sphere  it  is  turned  again  upside  down,  and  so  the  image  within 
the  eye  becomes  upright  as  was  the  object  outside  the  eye.

OF  THE  CENTRAL  LINE  OF  THE  EYE 

There  is  only  one  line  of  the  images  that  penetrate  to  the  visual* 
faculty  that  has  no  intersection,  and  this  has  no  sensible  dimensions 
because  it  is  a  mathematical  line  and  has  its  origin  in  a  mathematical 
point  which  has  no  dimensions. 

Necessity  requires  according  to  my  opponent  that  the  central  line  of 
all  the  images  which  enter  through  the  fine  and  narrow  openings  into 


260  OPTICS 

a  dark  place  shall  be  turned  upside  down  together  with  all  the  images 
of  the  bodies  that  surround  it. 


OF  THE  INTERSECTION  OF  THE  IMAGES  IN  THE  PUPIL 

OF  THE  EYE 

The  intersections  of  the  images  at  the  entrance  of  the  pupil  do  not 
mingle  one  in  another  in  that  space  where  this  intersection  unites 
them;  and  this  is  evident  because  if  the  rays  of  the  sun  pass  through 
two  panes  of  glass  in  contact  one  with  another,  the  one  of  these  being 
blue  and  the  other  yellow,  the  ray  that  penetrates  them  does  not  as- 
sume the  hue  of  blue  or  yellow  but  of  a  most  beautiful  green.  And  the 
same  process  would  occur  with  the  eye  if  the  images  yellow  and  green 
in  colour  should  come  to  mingle  one  with  the  other  at  the  intersection 
which  they  make  within  themselves  at  the  entrance  of  the  pupil,  but  as 
this  does  not  happen  such  a  mingling  does  not  exist. 

OF  THE  NATURE  OF  THE  RAYS  FORMED  BY  THE  IMAGES 
OF  BODIES  AND  THEIR  INTERSECTION 

The  straight  line  of  the  rays  which  transmit  through  the  air  the  form 
and  colour  of  the  bodies  whence  they  proceed  does  not  itself  tinge  the 
air  nor  can  they  tinge  one  another  at  the  contact  of  their  intersection, 
but  they  only  colour  the  place  where  they  lose  their  existence,  because 
this  place  sees  and  is  seen  by  the  original  source  of  these  rays,  and  no 
other  object  that  surrounds  this  original  source  can  be  seen  from  the 
place  where  this  ray  is  cut  off  and  destroyed,  leaving  there  the  spoil  it 
has  carried  off.  This  is  proved  by  the  fourth,  on  the  colour  of  bodies, 
which  says  the  surface  of  every  opaque  body  shares  in  the  colour  of 
surrounding  objects;  so  we  conclude  that  the  place  which  by  means  of 
the  ray  that  carries  the  image  sees  and  is  seen  by  the  source  of  this 
'image  is  tinged  by  the  colour  of  this  object. 

How  innumerable  rays  from  innumerable  images  can  converge  in  a 
point: 

As  in  a  point  all  lines  pass  without  occupation  the  one  of  the  other 
through  their  being  without  body,  so  may  pass  all  the  images  of  the 
surfaces,  and  as  each  given  point  faces  every  object  opposite  to  it  and 


OPTICS  261 

every  object  faces  the  opposite  natural  point,  also  through  this  point 
may  pass  the  converging  rays  of  these  images  which  after  passing  it 
will  reform  and  increase  again  to  the  size  of  these  images.  But  their  im- 
pressions will  appear  reversed  as  is  shown  in  the  first  above,  where  it  is 
said  that  every  image  intersects  at  the  entrance  of  the  narrow  openings 
made  in  an  extremely  thin  substance. 

In  proportion  as  the  opening  is  smaller  than  the  shaded  body  by  so 
much  the  less  will  the  images  transmitted  through  this  opening  pene- 
trate one  into  another.  The  images  which  pass  through  the  openings 
in  a  dark  place  intersect  at  a  point  so  much  nearer  the  opening  as  this 
opening  is  of  less  width.  .  .  . 

It  is  impossible  that  the  images  of  bodies  should  be  seen  between  the 
bodies  and  the  openings  through  which  the  images  of  these  bodies 
penetrate;  and  this  is  evident  because  where  the  atmosphere  is  illumi- 
nated these  images  do  not  become  visible. 

When  images  are  duplicated  by  mutually  penetrating  one  another 
they  always  have  double  depth  of  tone.

THE  NOTE  OF  THE  ECHO 

The  note  of  the  echo  is  either  continuous  or  intermittent,  it  occurs 
singly  or  is  united,  is  of  brief  or  long  duration,  finite  or  endless  in 
sound,  immediate  or  far  away. 

It  is  continuous  when  the  surface  on  which  the  echo  is  produced  is 
uniformly  concave.  The  note  of  the  echo  is  intermittent  when  the 
place  which  produces  it  is  broken  and  interrupted.  It  is  single  when  it 
is  produced  in  one  place  only.  It  is  united  when  it  is  produced  in  sev- 
eral places.  It  is  either  brief  or  long-continuing,  as  when  it  goes 
winding  round  within  a  bell  which  has  been  struck,  or  in  a  cistern  or 
other  hollow  space,  or  in  clouds  wherein  the  note  recurs  at  fixed  dis- 
tances in  regular  intervals  of  time,  ever  uniformly  growing  fainter,  and 
is  like  the  wave  that  spreads  itself  out  in  a  circle  over  the  sea. 

The  sound  often  seems  to  proceed  from  the  direction  of  the  echo,  and 
not  from  the  place  where  the  real  sound  is;  and  similarly  it  happened 
at  Ghiera  d'Adda,  when  a  fire  which  broke  out  there  caused  in  the  air 
twelve  lurid  reflections  upon  twelve  clouds,  and  the  cause  was  not  per- 
ceived, c.a.  77  v.  b 

Whether  the  whole  circle  made  in  the  air  by  the  sound  of  a  man's

What  has  been  said  is  shown  in  the  case  of  light,  and  you  would  be 
able  to  say  whether  the  whole  of  the  light  illumines  the  whole  of  a 
building,  since  the  part  of  this  building  would  not  be  illumined  merely 
In  a  part  of  this  light. 

If  you  wish  to  dispute  the  point  and  say  that  this  light  illumines  the 
said  part  of  the  habitation  not  with  the  whole  but  with  its  part,  I  will 
give  you  the  instance  of  one  or  two  mirrors  set  in  different  positions  on 
this  spot,  each  part  of  this  mirror  will  have  within  itself  the  whole  of 
the  said  light;  this  shows  therefore  that  this  light  is  all  in  all  and  all 
in  every  part  of  this  habitation;  and  it  is  the  same  with  the  voice  in  its 
circle.  c.a.  199  v.  b

OF  THE  SOUND  WHICH  SEEMS  TO  REMAIN  IN  THE   BELL 
AFTER  THE  STROKE 

'That  sound  which  remains  or  seems  to  remain  in  the  bell  after  it  has 
received  the  stroke  is  not  in  the  bell  itself  but  in  the  ear  of  the  listener, 
and  the  ear  retains  within  itself  the  image  of  the  stroke  of  the  bell 
which  it  has  heard,  and  only  loses  it  by  slow  degrees,  like  that  which 
the  impression  of  the  sun  creates  in  the  eye,  which  only  by  slow  de- 
grees becomes  lost  and  is  no  longer  seen.' 

A  proof  to  the  contrary 

If  the  aforesaid  proposition  were  true,  you  would  not  be  able  to  cause 
the  sound  of  the  bell  to  cease  abruptly  by  touching  it  with  the  palm 
of  the  hand,  especially  at  the  beginning  of  its  strength,  for  surely  if  it 
were  touched  it  would  not  happen  that  as  you  touched  the  bell  with 
the  hand  the  ear  would  simultaneously  withhold  the  sound;  whereas 

xThe  reference  is  presumably  to  Pythagoras's  discovery  of  the  dependence  of  the 
musical  intervals  on  certain  arithmetical  ratios.

we  see  that  if  after  the  stroke  has  taken  place  the  hand  is  placed  upon 
the  thing  which  is  struck  the  sound  suddenly  ceases.        c.a.  332  v.  a

THE  NATURE  OF  THE  EFFECT  OF  THE  ROAR  OF  THE 

CANNON 

The  rumbling  of  the  cannon  is  caused  by  the  impetuous  fury  of  the 
flame  beaten  back  by  the  resisting  air,  and  that  quantity  of  the  powder 
causes  this  effect  because  it  finds  itself  ignited  within  the  body  of  the 
cannon;  and  not  perceiving  itself  in  a  place  that  has  capacity  for  it  to 
increase,  nature  guides  it  to  search  with  fury  a  place  suitable  for  its 
increase,  and  breaking  or  driving  before  it  the  weaker  obstacle  it  wins 
its  way  into  the  spacious  air;  and  this  not  being  capable  of  escaping 
with  the  speed  with  which  it  is  attacked,  because  the  fire  is  more 
volatile  than  the  air,  it  follows  that  as  the  air  is  not  equally  volatile  with 
the  fire  it  cannot  make  way  for  it  with  that  velocity  and  swiftness  with 
which  the  fire  assails  it,  and  therefore  it  happens  that  there  is  resistance, 
and  the  resistance  is  the  cause  of  a  great  roar  and  rumbling  of  the 
cannon. 

But  if  the  cannon  were  to  be  moved  against  the  oncoming  of  an  im- 
petuous wind  it  would  be  the  occasion  of  a  greater  roar  made  by  reason 
of  the  greater  resistance  of  the  air  against  the  flame,  and  so  it  would 
make  a  less  rumbling  when  moved  in  the  line  of  the  wind  because 
there  would  then  be  less  resistance. 

In  marshy  places  or  other  wide  tracts  of  air  the  cannon  will  make  a 
louder  report  close  at  hand,  and  at  a  lesser  distance  it  will  be  perceived 
that  up  on  the  mountains  or  in  other  places  where  the  air  is  rarefied,  if 


ACOUSTICS  265 

the  air  be  thick  or  thin  equally  and  without  direct  movement  of  winds, 
the  roar  will  be  equally  perceptible  round  about  its  cause,  and  it  would 
io  on  expanding  from  circle  to  circle  just  as  the  circles  of  water  do 
when  caused  by  a  stone  thrown  into  it;  and  in  that  place  where 
similar  instrumenti  are  being  used  the  adjacent  air  will  break  or  scatter 
all  the  things  of  weak  power  of  resistance.  All  the  large  vessels  with 
wide  mouths  will  become  broken,  the  windows  of  paper  and  such  like 
things;  the  neighbouring  roofs  will  all  be  shaken  on  their  supports; 
and  this  will  take  place  though  many  windows  and  doors  stand  open, 
and  walls  which  are  thin  and  without  buttresses  will  become  dan- 
gerous. 

This  happens  because  the  air  swells  and  presses  itself  out  and  wishes 
to  escape  in  all  directions  in  which  movement  is  possible.  Doors  win- 
dows trees  and  such  things  as  these  will  all  be  moved,  and  if  you  set 
an  arrow  lightly  fastened  with  a  small  stone  it  will  be  carried  about  a 
distance  of  six  miles  through  the  movement  of  the  air.  Tr.  44  a 

WHAT  THING  IS  SOUND  CAUSED  BY  THE  BLOW? 

The  time  in  which  the  blow  is  produced  is  the  shortest  thing  that  can 
be  done  by  man,  and  no  body  is  so  great  but  that  being  suspended  it 
makes  an  instant  movement  at  a  sudden  blow;  which  movement  beats 
back  in  the  air  and  the  air  sounds  as  it  touches  the  thing  moved. 

WHETHER  THE  SOUND  LIES  IN  THE  HAMMER  OR  IN 

THE  ANVIL 

I  say  that  because  the  anvil  is  not  suspended  it  cannot  resound.  The 
hammer  resounds  in  the  jump  that  it  makes  after  the  blow,  and  if  the 
anvil  were  to  re-echo  the  sound  made  on  it  by  every  small  hammer  as 
does  the  bell  with  every  different  thing  which  strikes  it  with  the  same 
depth  of  tone,  so  would  the  anvil  when  struck  by  each  different  ham- 
mer; and  as  therefore  you  hear  different  notes  with  hammers  of  dif- 
ferent sizes  it  follows  that  the  note  is  in  the  hammer  and  not  in  the 
anvil. 

Why  the  thing  which  is  not  suspended  does  not  sound  and  when 
suspended  every  slight  contact  takes  away  the  sound  from  it: 


266  ACOUSTICS 


The  bell  when  struck  makes  a  sudden  tremor  and  the  sudden  tremor 
causes  it  instantly  to  strike  the  circumscribing  air,  which  instantly 
resounds. 

On  being  impeded  by  any  slight  contact  it  does  not  make  the  tremor 
or  strike  and  so  the  air  does  not  resound. 

If  the  bird  suddenly  beats  the  air  ought  this  to  resound  or  no: 

I  maintain  it  does  not  because  as  the  air  penetrates  through  the  thing 

that  beats  it  it  does  not  receive  the  blow  and  consequently  it  cannot 

make  sound. 

OF  THE  BOMBARD  OR  ARROW 

Here  sounds  movement  of  air  more  powerful  than  the  resisting  air. 

Tr.  64  a 

CONCERNING  VIOLENCE 

I  say  that  every  body  moved  or  struck  keeps  in  itself  for  a  time  the 
nature  of  this  blow  or  movement,  and  keeps  it  so  much  more  or  less 
in  proportion  as  the  power  of  the  force  of  this  blow  or  movement  is 
greater  or  less. 

Example 

Observe  a  blow  given  on  a  bell  how  much  it  preserves  in  itself  the 
noise  of  the  percussion. 

Observe  a  stone  projected  from  a  bombard  how  much  it  preserves 
the  nature  of  the  movement. 

The  blow  given  on  a  thick  body  will  keep  its  sound  longer  than  on 
a  thin  body,  and  that  will  be  of  longest  duration  which  is  made  upon  a 
body  that  is  suspended  and  thin.  The  eye  keeps  within  itself  the 
images  of  luminous  bodies  for  a  certain  interval  of  time.     Tr.  73  a 

It  is  possible  to  recognise  by  the  ear  the  distance  of  a  clap  of  thunder, 
on  first  seeing  its  flash,  from  its  resemblance  to  the  note  of  the  echo. 

The  voice  is  all  in  all  and  all  in  the  part  of  the  wall  surface  where  it 
strikes.  And  that  part  which  is  formed  in  such  a  way  as  to  be  fitted  to 
send  back  the  percussion,  gives  back  the  voice  in  as  many  different 
small  portions  of  itself  as  there  are  different  positions  of  the  hearers.

The  ear  receives  the  images  of  sounds  by  straight  curved  and  broken 
lines  and  no  twists  can  break  its  function.  a    19   r. 

The  voice  after  it  has  struck  on  the  object  will  return  to  the  ear  by  a 
line  at  a  slant  equal  to  that  of  the  line  of  the  incidence;  that  is  the  line 
which  carries  the  voice  from  its  cause  to  the  place  where  this  voice  can 
reform  itself;  and  this  voice  acts  in  the  manner  of  a  thing  seen  in  a 
mirror  which  is  all  in  all  the  mirror  and  all  in  the  part  of  it.  Let  us  say 
therefore  that  the  mirror  is  a  b  and  the  thing  seen  is  c;  just  as  c  sees 
all  the  parts  of  the  mirror  so  all  the  parts  of  the  mirror  see  c;  there- 
fore c  is  all  in  all  the  mirror  because  it  is  in  all  its  parts;  and  it  is  all 
in  the  parts  because  it  sees  itself  in  as  many  different  parts  as  there  are 
different  positions  of  spectators  .  .  . 

Let  us  take  the  sun  as  an  example:  if  you  should  walk  along  the 
bank  of  a  river  and  watch  the  sun's  reflection  in  it,  for  so  long  a  time 
as  you  walk  along  the  bank  of  the  river  it  will  seem  that  the  sun  moves 
with  you,  and  this  because  the  sun  is  all  in  the  whole  and  all  in  the 
part.  a  19  v. 

OF  A  BLOW 

The  blow  given  in  the  bell  leaves  its  likeness  behind  it  impressed  as 
is  that  of  the  sun  in  the  eye  or  the  scent  in  the  air;  but  we  wish  to  dis- 
cern whether  the  likeness  of  the  blow  remains  in  the  bell  or  in  the  air, 
and  this  is  ascertained  by  placing  your  ear  to  the  surface  of  the  bell 
after  the  blow. 

The  blow  given  in  the  bell  will  cause  a  slight  sound  and  movement 
in  another  bell  similar  to  itself,  and  the  chord  of  a  lute  as  it  sounds 
produces  movement  and  response  in  another  similar  chord  of  like  tone 
in  another  lute,  and  this  you  will  perceive  by  placing  a  straw  upon  the 
chord  similar  to  that  which  has  sounded.  a  22  v. 


OF  THE  VOICE 

Whether  many  tiny  voices  joined  together  will  make  as  much  sound 
as  one  large  one.  I  maintain  they  will  not;  for  if  you  were  to  take  ten 
thousand  voices  of  flies  all  together  they  would  not  carry  as  far  as  the 
voice  of  a  man,  and  if  such  voice  of  a  man  were  split  up  into  ten 


268  ACOUSTICS 

thousand  parts  no  one  of  these  parts  would  be  equal  to  the  size  of  the 
voice  of  a  fly.  a  23  r. 

OF  SOUND 

Whether  a  sound  that  is  double  another  will  be  heard  twice  as  far. 
I  maintain  that  it  will  not  for  if  it  were  so  two  men  shouting  would  be 
heard  twice  as  far  as  one;  but  experience  does  not  confirm  this. 

a  43  r. 

If  you  cause  your  ship  to  stop,  and  place  the  head  of  a  long  tube  in 
the  water,  and  place  the  other  extremity  to  your  ear,  you  will  hear  ships 
at  a  great  distance  from  you. 

You  can  also  do  the  same  by  placing  the  head  of  the  tube  upon 
the  ground,  and  you  will  then  hear  anyone  passing  at  a  distance  from 
you.  b  6  r. 

[Of  the  echo] 

The  voice  after  having  proceeded  from  the  man  and  having  been 
beaten  back  by  the  wall  will  fly  upwards.  If  there  be  a  ledge  above  this 
wall  with  a  right  angle  the  surface  above  will  send  back  the  voice 
towards  its  cause. 

How  one  should  make  the  voice  of  the  echo  which  whatever  thing 
you  may  say  will  be  repeated  to  you  in  many  voices :

The  voice  which  issues  forth  from  the  horn  forms  itself  on  the  op- 
posite wall  and  from  there  leaps  back  to  the  second,  and  from  the 
second  [it  returns]  to  the  first,  as  a  ball  that  rebounds  between  two 
walls  which  diminishes  its  bounds;  and  so  the  voices  grow  less.

OF  THE  SOUND  MADE  BY  PERCUSSION 

Sound  cannot  be  heard  at  such  close  proximity  to  the  ear  that  the 
eye  does  not  first  see  the  contact  of  the  blow,  and  the  reason  is  this : — 
if  we  admit  that  the  time  of  the  blow  is  indivisible,  that  the  nature  of 
the  blow  does  not  produce  its  expansion  upon  the  body  which  has  been 
struck  without  time,  that  no  body  struck  can  resound  whilst  the  thing 


ACOUSTICS  269 

1h.1t  strikes  is  touching  it,  and  that  the  sound  cannot  travel  from  the 
body  struck  to  the  ear  without  time,  then  you  must  admit  that  the 
thing  which  strikes  is  separated  and  divided  from  the  thing  struck  be- 
fore this  thing  struck  can  of  itself  have  any  resonance;  and  not  having 
this  it  cannot  give  it  to  the  ear.  c  6  v. 

OF  REFLEX  MOVEMENTS 

I  wish  to  define  why  bodily  and  spiritual  movements  after  the  per- 
cussion made  by  them  upon  the  object  spring  back  within  equal  angles. 

OF  BODILY  MOVEMENTS 

I  say  that  the  note  of  the  echo  is  cast  back  to  the  ear  after  it  has 
struck,  just  as  the  images  of  objects  strike  the  mirror  and  are  thence 
reflected  to  the  eye.  And  in  the  same  way  as  these  images  fall  from  the 
object  to  the  mirror  and  from  the  mirror  to  the  eye  at  equal  angles,  so 
the  note  of  the  echo  will  strike  and  rebound  within  the  hollow  where 
it  has  first  struck,  at  equal  angles  to  the  ear.  c  16  r. 

OF  SOUNDS 

Why  the  swift  wind  which  passes  through  a  reed  makes  a  shrill 
sound : 

The  wind  passing  through  the  same  reed  will  make  a  sound  so  much 
deeper  or  shriller  in  proportion  as  it  is  slower  or  swifter.  And  this  is 
seen  in  the  changes  in  the  sounds  made  by  trumpets  or  horns  without 
holes  and  also  in  the  winds  that  howl  in  the  chinks  of  doors  or  win- 
dows. This  originates  in  the  air,  where  the  sound  having  issued  forth 
from  the  instrument  traverses  the  valley  and  proceeds  to  spread  itself 
in  a  greater  or  less  degree  according  as  the  air  is  driven  by  a  greater 
or  smaller  force.  This  may  be  proved.  e  4  v. 

Why  the  reflex  movement  of  the  stone  makes  more  noise  in  the  air 
than  its  incidental  movement,  the  reflex  movement  being  less  powerful 
than  the  incidental,  and  whether  this  reflex  movement  makes  a  greater 
or  less  sound  as  the  angle  of  its  incidence  is  more  or  less  obtuse.  But  as 
regards  the  first  question  the  reflex  movement  is  made  by  the  composite 


270  ACOUSTICS 

movement  of  this  projectile,  and  the  incidental  movement  is  made  by 
the  same  movement  of  the  same  projectile;  and  for  this  reason  the 
sound  is  in  the  reflex  movement  of  the  projectile  and  not  in  the  inci- 
dental movement.  As  regards  the  second  question  in  proportion  as  the 
angle  is  more  obtuse  the  projectile  is  more  disposed  to  revolve  than 
when  the  percussion  is  made  between  acute  angles.  e  28  v. 

[Acoustics] 

The  sound  caused  by  the  wind  or  by  a  blow  will  grow  fainter  when 
as  a  result  of  time  or  distance  it  is  further  removed  from  its  cause. 

The  stroke  given  to  the  bell  will  go  on  growing  less  as  more  time 
passes  and  it  is  the  same  whether  the  distance  is  far  or  near.

If  the  excessive  size  of  the  rivers  damages  and  destroys  the  sea  coasts, 
then  if  such  rivers  cannot  be  diverted  to  other  places  they  should  be 
parted  into  small  streams. 

Comparison 

If  a  bell  which  sounds  is  heard  at  six  miles  and  weighs  six  thousand 
pounds,  six  miles  being  eighteen  thousand  braccia  .  .  .  But  not  to  ex- 
tend myself  in  too  many  arguments  I  maintain  that  if  I  were  to  split 
it  up  into  tiny  bells  it  will  not  be  heard  at  an  eighth  of  a  mile  even 
though  all  the  metal  rings  in  the  bells  at  the  same  time. 

Similarly  if  a  rope  supports  a  hundred  thousand  ounces  and  you 
separate  it  into  a  hundred  thousand  strands,  each  strand  of  itself  will 
not  support  one  eighth  part  of  an  ounce.  And  so  it  follows  with  all  the 
separated  powers.  1  in  [63]  r. 


SOUND  OF  THE  ECHO

Why  will  the  deep-toned  vessel  with  contracted  mouth  have  a  much 
deeper  and  lower  sound  in  its  percussion  when  it  has  a  narrow  mouth

How  the  sound  of  the  voice  is  lost  by  reason  of  distance: 
[  With  (I ia gram] 

At  the  distance  a  b  the  two  voices  m  n  are  diminished  by  half;  con- 
sequently although  there  are  two  half  voices  they  are  not  as  powerful 
as  one  whole  voice  but  merely  as  a  half. 

And  if  an  infinite  number  of  halves  should  find  themselves  at  such 
distance  they  would  only  amount  to  a  half. 

And  at  the  same  distance  the  voice  /  which  is  double  n  and  m  hav- 
ing lost  the  fourth  part  of  its  power  remains  consequently  as  a  voice 
and  a  half,  and  surpasses  in  three  times  the  power,  so  that  at  three 
times  the  distance,  that  is  at  g,  f  will  be  as  powerful  as  m  n  are  at  the 
distance  a  b.  l  79  v.

(bombarda)  is  nothing  but  a  separation  of  compressed  air.       l  89  v.

The  wave  of  the  flame  created  by  the  setting  fire  to  the  powder  of

If  flies  made  with  their  mouths  the  sound  that  is  heard  when  they 
fly  then  since  it  is  very  long  and  sustained  they  would  need  a  great  pair 
of  bellows  for  lungs  in  order  to  drive  out  so  great  and  so  long  a  wind, 
and  then  there  would  be  a  long  silence  in  order  to  draw  into  them-

selves  an  equal  volume  of  air;  therefore  where  there  was  a  long  dura- 
tion of  sound  there  would  be  a  long  intermission.  b.m.  257  v. 

If  a  bell  were  to  be  heard  with  its  sound  two  miles,  and  then  it  were 
to  be  melted  down  and  cast  again  into  a  number  of  small  bells,  cer- 
tainly if  they  are  all  sounded  at  one  time  they  will  never  be  heard  at 
as  great  a  distance  as  when  they  were  all  in  one  bell.

If  you  make  two  bells  of  the  same  shape  and  the  one  double  the  size 
of  the  other  but  of  the  same  weight  the  larger  will  have  twice  the  depth 
of  tone.  Forster  in  5  r. 

[Of  the  buzzing  of  flies] 

That  the  sound  which  flies  make  proceeds  from  their  wings  you  will 
see  by  cutting  them  a  little,  or  better  still  by  smearing  them  a  little  with 
honey  in  such  a  way  as  not  entirely  to  prevent  them  from  flying,  and 
you  will  see  that  the  sound  made  by  the  movement  of  the  wings  will 
become  hoarse  and  the  note  will  change  from  high  to  deep  to  just  the 
same  degree  as  it  has  lost  the  free  use  of  its  wings.         Fogli  a  15  v.

If  you  know  the  distance  of  a  body  you  will  know  the  size  of  the

ask  yourself: — if  within  such  a  space  the  diameter  of  the  moon  in- 
creases for  me  so  much  above  the  first  section  what  will  it  do  in  the

exact  diameter  of  this  moon.

If  the  water  of  the  moon  had  its  centre  of  gravity  at  the  centre  of  the 
earth,  it  would  strip  the  moon  and  fall  upon  us  .  .  .  suspended  from 
the  centre  of  its  sphere. 

If  you  should  be  moving  towards  the  sun  along  that  line  of  water 
which  lies  between  this  sun  and  its  image,  you  will  be  sailing  along  a 
continuous  image  which  will  be  of  the  length  of  your  movement. 

Why  the  moon  when  surrounded  by  the  luminous  part  of  the  sun  in 
the  west  has  greater  radiance  in  the  centre  of  this  circle  than  when  there 
is  an  eclipse  of  the  sun.  This  comes  about  because  as  it  eclipses  the 
sun  it  casts  a  shadow  upon  our  ocean,  and  this  does  not  occur  when 
it  is  in  the  west,  for  then  the  sun  lights  up  this  ocean. 

Why  in  the  eclipse  of  the  sun  the  body  of  the  moon  when  it  is  op- 
posite to  us  shows  itself  in  the  middle  of  the  sun  with  part  of  its  ra- 
diance somewhat  like  that  of  molten  iron.  This  proceeds  from  the 

273 


274  ASTRONOMY 

moon  which  derives  its  radiance  from  the  stars,  and  not  from  the  earth, 
because  this  is  darkened.  .  .  .  c.a.  243  v.  a 

The  image  of  the  sun  is  all  in  all  the  water  which  sees  it,  and  all  ir 
every  minutest  part  of  it. 

This  is  proved  because  there  are  as  many  images  of  the  sun  as  there 
are  positions  of  the  eyes  which  see  the  water  between  themselves  and 
the  sun. 

Moreover  as  the  eye  moves  when  carried  along  the  line  of  the  ship 
it  sees  the  image  of  the  sun  moving  along  the  same  line  as  that  of  the 
movement  of  the  eye;  but  it  will  not  be  parallel  for  as  the  sun  moves 
to  the  west  the  line  of  the  images  moves  in  a  curve  towards  the  sun, 
in  such  a  way  as  to  seem  finally  to  unite  with  the  image  of  the  sun 
when  it  has  reached  the  horizon. 

If  the  ship's  movement  be  to  the  south  and  the  sun  is  in  the  middle 
of  the  heaven  the  line  of  the  image  of  the  sun  will  be  curved,  and  it 
will  always  go  on  extending  itself,  so  that  at  the  last  it  will  unite  with 
the  sun  on  the  horizon  and  the  image  will  seem  equal  in  size  to  this 
sun.  c.a.  243  v.  b 

How  bodies  send  forth  from  themselves  their  form  heat  and  potency: 
When  the  sun  during  an  eclipse  assumes  the  shape  of  a  crescent,  take 
a  thin  plate  of  iron  and  make  a  small  hole  in  it,  and  turn  the  face  of 
this  plate  towards  the  sun,  holding  a  sheet  of  paper  behind  it  at  a  dis- 
tance of  half  a  braccio,  and  you  will  see  the  image  of  the  sun  appear 
on  this  sheet  in  the  shape  of  a  crescent,  similar  in  form  and  colour  to 
its  cause. 

Quality  of  the  sun: 

The  sun  has  substance,  shape,  movement,  radiance,  heat  and  genera- 
tive power;  and  these  qualities  all  emanate  from  itself  without  its 
diminution.  c.a.  270  v.  b 

The  solar  rays  after  penetrating  the  little  holes  which  come  between 
the  various  rounded  particles  of  the  clouds  take  a  straight  and  con- 
tinuous course  to  the  ground  where  they  strike,  illuminating  with  their 
radiance  all  the  air  through  which  they  pass.  c.a.  297  v.  a 


ASTRONOMY  275 

It  the  moon  is  a  mirror  of  our  earth,  when  it  is  at  the  full  the  earth 
will  be  half  dark  and  half  illuminated,  or  perhaps  more  than  half  dark. 

And  of  dark  things  we  cannot  discern  the  shapes  of  the  objects  which 
are  within  their  boundaries. 

The  adversary  says  that  the  light  of  the  moon  illumines  the  portion 
of  the  earth  seen  by  it,  and  for  this  reason,  as  the  earth  is  surrounded 
by  water,  that  only  the  water  reflects  the  light  of  the  moon,  and  the 
earth  as  it  is  not  smooth  or  polished  in  its  surface  as  is  the  water,  does 
not  transmit  the  image  of  itself  to  this  water,  and  so  it  remains  dark, 
and  thus  our  water  shines  in  the  moon  with  the  darkness  of  the  islands 
which  it  surrounds.  c.a.  300  r.  b 

The  moon  has  every  month  a  winter  and  a  summer. 
And  it  has  greater  colds  and  greater  heats  and  its  equinoxes  are 
colder  than  ours.  c.a.  303  v.  b 

How  it  is  possible  for  the  quantity  of  the  images  of  the  sun  to  pass 
through  the  indivisible  point  of  the  primitive  into  the  derivative 
pyramid: 

The  sun  is  composed  of  a  very  great  number  of  indivisible  parts;  and 
although  this  sun  is  possessed  of  bodily  substance  its  powers  are  incor- 
poreal consisting  of  heat  and  radiance;  and  since  an  incorporeal  power 
has  no  substance  not  having  substance  it  does  not  occupy  space,  and 
not  occupying  space  it  does  not  close  the  aperture,  and  consequently  the 
passage  through  this  aperture  to  and  fro  is  permitted  to  each  spirit  at 
the  same  time. 

It  is  possible  that  the  solar  rays  reduced  through  a  pyramid  to  a  point 
by  the  concave  mirror  is  redoubled  in  warmth  and  radiance;  as  these 
rays  are  in  the  derived  pyramid  they  are  thrown  back  by  a  similar  mir- 
ror to  an  equal  distance  from  the  point.  c.a.  347  v.  a 

OF  THE  CIRCLES  OF  THE  MOON 

I  find  that  those  circles  which  at  night  seem  to  surround  the  moon, 
varying  in  circumference  and  in  their  degree  of  redness,  are  caused  by 
the  different  degrees  of  thickness  of  the  vapours  which  are  situated  at 
different  altitudes  between  the  moon  and  our  eyes.  And  the  circle  that 
is  larger  and  less  red  is  in  the  first  part  lower  than  the  said  vapours;  the 


276  ASTRONOMY 

second,  being  less,  is  higher  and  appears  redder,  because  it  is  seen 
through  two  sets  of  vapours;  and  so  the  higher  they  are  the  smaller  and 
the  redder  will  they  appear,  for  between  the  eye  and  them  there  will  be 
more  layers  of  vapours,  and  this  goes  to  prove  that  where  there  appears 
greater  redness,  there  is  a  greater  quantity  of  vapours.      c.a.  349  v.  e 


BURNING  MIRROR  [sketch]

ever is  contained  in  its  base  so  many  times  is  it  hotter  than  this  base. 

a  54  r. 

WHAT  THE  MOON  IS 

The  moon  is  not  luminous  in  itself,  but  it  is  well  fitted  to  take  the 
characteristics  of  light  after  the  manner  of  the  mirror  or  of  water  or 
any  other  shining  body;  and  it  grows  larger  in  the  east  and  in  the  west 
like  the  sun  and  the  other  planets,  and  the  reason  of  this  is  that  every 
luminous  body  grows  larger  as  it  becomes  more  remote. 

It  may  be  readily  understood  that  every  planet  and  star  is  farther 
away  from  us  when  in  the  west  than  when  it  is  overhead,  by  about 
three  thousand  Rvt  hundred  [miles]  according  to  the  proof  given  at 
the  side  [of  the  page];1  and  if  you  see  the  sun  and  moon  reflected  in 
water  which  is  near  at  hand  it  will  seem  to  be  the  same  size  in  the 
water  as  it  does  in  the  sky,  while  if  you  go  away  to  the  distance  of  a 
mile  it  will  seem  a  hundred  times  as  large.  And  if  you  see  it  reflected  in 
the  sea  at  the  moment  of  its  setting  the  image  of  the  sun  will  seem  to 
you  to  be  more  than  ten  miles  long,  because  it  will  cover  in  the  reflec- 
tion more  than  ten  miles  of  sea.  And  if  you  were  where  the  moon  is,  it 
would  appear  to  you  that  the  sun  was  reflected  over  as  much  of  the  sea 
as  it  illumines  in  its  daily  course,  and  the  land  would  appear  amid  this 
water  like  the  dark  spots  that  are  upon  the  moon,  which  when  looked 
at  from  the  earth  presents  to  mankind  the  same  appearance  that  our 
earth  would  present  to  men  dwelling  in  the  moon.

ASTRONOMY  277 

OF  THE  NATURE  OF  THE  MOON 

When  all  that  we  can  see  of  the  moon  is  illumined  it  gives  us  its 
maximum  of  light,  and  then  from  the  reflection  of  the  rays  of  the  sun 
which  strike  upon  it  and  rebound  towards  us  its  ocean  throws  off  less 
moisture  to  us,  and  the  less  light  it  gives  the  more  it  is  harmful.

EXPLANATION  OF  WHY  THE  SUN  SEEMS  LARGER  IN 

THE  WEST 

Certain  mathematicians  contend  that  the  sun  grows  larger  when  it  is 
setting,  because  the  eye  sees  it  continually  through  atmosphere  of 
greater  density,  alleging  that  objects  seen  through  mist  and  in  water 
seem  larger. 

To  this  I  reply  that  this  is  not  the  case,  for  the  things  seen  through 
ihe  mist  are  similar  in  colour  to  those  which  are  at  a  distance,  but  as 
they  do  not  undergo  the  same  process  of  diminution,  they  appear 
greater  in  size. 

In  the  same  way  nothing  seems  larger  in  smooth  water,  and  this  you 
may  prove  by  tracing  upon  a  board  which  is  placed  under  water. 

The  real  reason  why  the  sun  grows  larger  is  that  every  luminous 
body  appears  larger,  as  it  is  farther  away.  a  64  v. 

PRAISE  OF  THE  SUN 

If  you  look  at  the  stars  without  their  rays, — as  may  be  done  by  look- 
ing at  them  through  a  small  hole  made  with  the  extreme  point  of  a 
fine  needle  and  placed  so  as  almost  to  touch  the  eye, — you  will  perceive 
these  stars  to  be  so  small  that  nothing  appears  less;  and  in  truth  the 
great  distance  gives  them  a  natural  diminution,  although  there  are 
many  there  which  are  a  great  many  times  larger  than  the  star  which  is 
our  earth  together  with  the  water.  Think,  then,  what  this  star  of  ours 
would  seem  like  at  so  great  a  distance,  and  then  consider  how  many 
stars  might  be  set  longitudinally  and  latitudinally  amid  these  stars 
which  are  scattered  throughout  this  dark  expanse.  I  can  never  do  other 
than  blame  those  many  ancients  who  said  that  the  sun  was  no  larger 


278  ASTRONOMY 

than  it  appears, — among  these  being  Epicurus;  and  I  believe  that  such 
a  theory  is  borrowed  from  the  idea  of  a  light  set  in  our  atmosphere 
equidistant  from  the  centre  [of  the  earth];  whoever  sees  it  never  sees 
it  lessened  in  size  at  any  distance,  and  the  reasons  of  its  size  and 
potency  I  shall  reserve  for  the  Fourth  Book. 

But  I  marvel  greatly  that  Socrates  should  have  spoken  with  dis- 
paragement of  that  body,  and  that  he  should  have  said  that  it  resembled 
a  burning  stone,  and  it  is  certain  that  whoever  opposes  him  in  such  an 
error  can  scarcely  do  wrong.  I  could  wish  that  I  had  such  power  of 
language  as  should  avail  me  to  censure  those  who  would  fain  extol  the 
worship  of  men  above  that  of  the  sun,  for  I  do  not  perceive  in  the  whole 
universe  a  body  greater  and  more  powerful  than  this,  and  its  light 
illumines  all  the  celestial  bodies  which  are  distributed  throughout  the 
universe. 

All  vital  principle  descends  from  it,  since  the  heat  there  is  in  living 
creatures  proceeds  from  this  vital  principle;  and  there  is  no  other  heat 
or  light  in  the  universe  as  I  shall  show  in  the  Fourth  Book,  and  indeed 
those  who  have  wished  to  worship  men  as  gods,  such  as  Jupiter,  Saturn, 
Mars  and  the  like,  have  made  a  very  grave  error  seeing  that  even  if  a 
man  were  as  large  as  our  earth  he  would  seem  like  one  of  the  least  of 
the  stars,  which  appears  but  a  speck  in  the  universe;  and  seeing  also 
that  these  men  are  mortal  and  subject  to  decay  and  corruption  in 
their  tombs. 

The  Spera,  and  Marullo,  and  many  others  praise  the  Sun. 

f  5  r.  and  4  v. 

The  stars  are  visible  by  night  and  not  by  day  owing  to  our  being 
beneath  the  dense  atmosphere  which  is  full  of  an  infinite  number  of 
particles  of  moisture.  Each  of  these  is  lit  up  when  it  is  struck  by  the  rays 
of  the  sun  and  consequently  the  innumerable  radiant  particles  veil  these 
stars;  and  if  it  were  not  for  this  atmosphere  the  sky  would  always  show 
the  stars  against  the  darkness.  f  5  v- 

Epicurus  perhaps  perceived  that  the  shadows  of  columns  striking  the 
opposite  walls  were  equal  in  diameter  to  the  column  from  which  they 
proceeded.  As  therefore  the  mass  of  the  shadow  from  beginning  to  end 
was  a  parallelogram  he  thought  he  might  infer  that  the  sun  also  was 
opposite  to  this  parallelogram  and  as  a  consequence  would  not  be  larger 


ASTRONOMY  279 

than  this  column,  not  perceiving  that  such  a  diminution  of  the  shadow 
would  be  imperceptible  on  account  of  the  great  distance  of  the  sun. 

If  the  sun  were  smaller  than  the  earth,  the  stars  in  a  great  part  of  our 
hemisphere  would  be  without  light:  this  is  contrary  to  Epicurus  who 
savs  that  the  sun  is  only  as  large  as  it  appears.  f  6  r. 

Epicurus  says  that  the  sun  is  as  large  as  it  shows  itself;  as  therefore  it 
appears  to  be  a  foot  we  have  to  reckon  it  as  such. 

It  would  follow  that  when  the  moon  obscured  the  sun  the  sun  would 
not  surpass  it  in  size  as  it  does;  therefore  the  moon  being  smaller  than 
the  sun  the  moon  would  be  less  than  a  foot,  and  consequently  when 
our  earth  obscured  the  moon  it  would  be  less  by  a  finger's  breadth,  see- 
ing that  if  the  sun  be  a  foot  across  and  our  earth  casts  a  pyramidal 
shadow  towards  the  moon  it  is  inevitable  that  the  luminous  body  which 
is  the  cause  of  the  shaded  pyramid  must  be  greater  than  the  opaque 
body  which  casts  this  pyramid.  f  8  v. 

A  calculation  of  how  many  times  the  sun  will  go  into  its  course  in 
twenty  four  hours: 

Make  a  circle  and  set  it  to  face  south  after  the  manner  of  sundials; 
place  a  rod  in  the  middle  of  it  so  that  its  length  is  pointing  to  the  centre 
of  the  circle  and  note  the  shadow  made  by  the  sun  from  this  rod  upon 
the  circumference  of  the  circle,  and  let  us  say  that  the  breadth  of  the 
shadow  is  all  a  n  (diagram).  Now  measure  how  many  times  this 
shadow  will  go  into  this  circumference  of  the  circle,  and  this  will  be  the 
number  of  times  that  the  solar  body  will  go  into  its  course  in  twenty 
four  hours.  In  this  way  one  may  see  whether  Epicurus  was  right  in  say- 
ing that  the  sun  is  as  large  as  it  seems  to  be,  for  as  the  apparent  diame- 
ter of  the  sun  is  about  a  foot  and  as  the  sun  would  go  a  thousand  times 
into  its  course  in  twenty  four  hours,  the  length  of  its  course  would  be 
a  thousand  feet,  that  is  five  hundred  braccia,  which  is  the  sixth  of  a 
mile;  so  then  the  course  of  the  sun  between  day  and  night  would  be 
the  sixth  part  of  a  mile,  and  this  venerable  snail  the  sun  would  have 
travelled  twenty  five  braccia  an  hour.  nor.

First  explain  the  mechanism  of  the  eye,  then  show  how  the  scintilla- 
tion of  each  star  originates  in  the  eye,  and  why  the  scintillation  of  one 
star  is  greater  than  that  of  another.  And  how  the  rays  of  the  stars  origi- 
nate in  the  eye.  I  affirm  that  if  the  scintillation  of  the  stars  was  as  it 
appears,  in  the  stars,  this  scintillation  would  show  itself  as  widely  ex- 
tended as  the  body  of  the  star;  and  since  it  is  larger  than  the  earth  this 
movement  made  instantaneously  would  swiftly  be  found  to  cause  the 
star  to  seem  double  in  size.  See  afterwards  how  the  surface  of  the  air 
on  the  confines  of  the  fire,  and  the  surface  of  the  fire  at  its  boundary,  is 
that  in  which  the  solar  rays  penetrating  carry  the  resemblance  of  the 
heavenly  bodies,  large  in  their  rising  and  setting  and  small  when  they 
are  in  the  centre  of  the  sky.  f  25  v. 


AN  EXPERIMENT  IN  ORDER  TO  SHOW  HOW  RAYS 
PENETRATE  LIQUID  BODIES 

Make  two  vessels  each  of  parallel  sides,  the  one  four  fifths  of  the 
other  and  of  equal  height.  Then  Rx  one  within  the  other  as  you  see  in 
the  drawing,  and  cover  outside  with  colour  and  leave  an  opening  of  the 
size  of  a  lentil,  and  allow  a  ray  of  the  sun  to  enter  there  which  makes 
its  exit  through  another  dark  hole  or  by  the  window.  Then  observe 
whether  the  ray  that  passes  within  the  water  enclosed  between  the  two 
vessels  keeps  the  direction  that  it  has  outside  or  no;  and  from  this  de- 
duce your  rule. 

In  order  to  see  how  the  solar  rays  penetrate  this  curve  of  the  sphere 
of  the  air  have  two  balls  made  of  glass  one  twice  as  large  as  the  other, 
and  let  them  be  as  round  as  possible.  Then  cut  them  in  half,  place  one 
inside  the  other,  close  them  in  front  and  fill  them  with  water,  then  let 
the  solar  ray  pass  within  as  you  have  done  above,  and  observe  whether 
the  ray  is  bent  or  curved  and  from  this  deduce  your  rule.  And  in  this 
way  you  can  make  an  infinite  number  of  experiments. 

Observe  as  you  place  yourself  with  your  eye  in  the  centre  of  the  ball 
whether  the  light  of  a  candle  keeps  its  size  or  no.  f  33  v.

OF  THE  SUN 

Some  say  that  the  sun  is  not  hot  because  it  is  not  the  colour  of  fire 
hut  is  much  paler  and  clearer.  To  these  we  may  reply  that  when  liqui- 
fied bronze  is  at  its  maximum  of  heat  it  most  resembles  the  sun  in 
colour,  and  when  it  is  less  hot  it  has  more  of  the  colour  of  fire.

The  solar  rays  reflected  by  the  surface  of  the  undulating  water  cause 
the  image  of  the  sun  to  seem  continuous  over  all  that  water  which  is 
between  the  universe  and  the  sun.  f  38  v. 

Why  the  image  of  the  sun  is  all  in  all  the  sphere  of  the  water  which 
sees  the  sun  and  all  in  each  part  of  the  said  water: 

All  the  sky  which  sees  the  part  of  the  sphere  of  the  water  seen  by  the 
sun  sees  all  this  water  covered  by  the  image  of  the  sun,  and  each  part 
of  the  sky  sees  all. 

The  surface  of  the  water  without  waves  lights  equally  the  places 
struck  by  the  reflected  rays  of  the  image  of  the  sun  in  the  water. 

The  image  of  the  sun  is  unique  in  the  sphere  of  the  water  seen  by 
the  sun,  which  shows  itself  however  to  all  the  sky  that  finds  itself 
before  it,  and  every  point  of  this  sky  itself  sees  an  image,  and  that 
which  sees  one  in  one  position  is  seen  by  the  other  in  another  position, 
in  such  a  way  that  no  part  of  the  sky  sees  it  all. 

That  image  of  the  sun  will  cover  a  greater  space  in  the  surface  of  the 
water  which  is  seen  from  a  place  more  distant  from  it.  f  39  r. 

How  the  earth  is  not  in  the  centre  of  the  circle  of  the  sun,  nor  in  the 
centre  of  the  universe,  but  is  in  fact  in  the  centre  of  its  elements  which 
accompany  it  and  are  united  to  it.  And  if  one  were  to  be  upon  the 
moon,  then  to  the  extent  to  which  it  together  with  the  sun  is  above  us,1 
so  far  below  it  would  our  earth  appear  with  the  element  of  water,  per- 
forming the  same  office  as  the  moon  does  for  us.  f  41  v. 

All  your  discourse  points  to  the  conclusion  that  the  earth  is  a  star 
almost  like  the  moon,  and  thus  you  will  prove  the  majesty  of  our  uni- 
verse; and  thus  you  will  make  a  discourse  concerning  the  size  of  many 
of  the  stars  according  to  the  authorities.  f  56  r.

282  ASTRONOMY 

Whether  the  friction  of  the  heavens  makes  a  sound  or  no: 
Every  sound  is  caused  by  the  air  striking  a  dense  body,  and  if  it  i 
made  by  two  heavy  bodies  one  with  another  it  is  by  means  of  the  ai 
that  surrounds  them;  and  this  friction  wears  away  the  bodies  that  ar 
rubbed.  It  would  follow  therefore  that  the  heavens  in  their  friction  nc 
having  air  between  them  would  not  produce  sound.  Had  however  thi 
friction  really  existed,  in  the  many  centuries  that  these  heavens  hav 
revolved  they  would  have  been  consumed  by  their  own  immense  spee< 
of  every  day.  And  if  they  made  a  sound  it  would  not  be  able  to  spreac 
because  the  sound  of  the  percussion  made  underneath  the  water  is  bu 
little  heard  and  it  would  be  heard  even  less  or  not  at  all  in  the  case  c 
dense  bodies.  Further  in  the  case  of  smooth  bodies  the  friction  does  nc 
create  sound,  and  it  would  happen  in  a  similar  manner  that  ther 
would  be  no  sound  in  the  contact  or  friction  of  the  heavens.  And  i 
these  heavens  are  not  smooth  at  the  contact  of  their  friction  it  follow 
that  they  are  full  of  lumps  and  rough,  and  therefore  their  contact  is  nc 
continuous,  and  if  this  is  the  case  the  vacuum  is  produced,  which  it  ha 
been  concluded  does  not  exist  in  nature.  We  arrive  therefore  at  th 
conclusion  that  the  friction  would  have  rubbed  away  the  boundaries  c 
each  heaven,  and  in  proportion  as  its  movement  is  swifter  towards  th 
centre  than  towards  the  poles  it  would  be  more  consumed  in  the  centr 
than  at  the  poles;  and  then  there  would  not  be  friction  any  more,  am 
the  sound  would  cease,  and  the  dancers  would  stop,  except  that  th 
heavens  were  turning  one  to  the  east  and  the  other  to  the  north. 

f  56  v. 

Whether  stars  have  light  from  the  sun  or  in  themselves : 
It  is  said  that  they  have  light  in  themselves,  since  if  Venus  and  Mer 
cury  had  no  light  of  their  own,  when  they  come  between  our  eye  an< 
the  sun  they  would  darken  as  much  of  the  sun  as  they  cover  from  ou 
eyes.  This  however  is  false,  because  it  has  been  proved  how  a  dark  ob 
ject  placed  against  a  luminous  body  is  surrounded  and  entirely  covere< 
by  the  lateral  rays  of  the  remainder  of  this  luminous  body,  and  so  i 
remains  invisible.  As  is  shown  when  the  sun  is  seen  through  the  rami 
fication  of  leafless  trees  in  the  far  distance  these  branches  do  not  con 
ceal  any  part  of  the  sun  from  our  eyes.  The  same  thing  happens  witl 
the  above  mentioned  planets,  for  though  they  are  themselves  withou 


ASTRONOMY  283 

li^ht  they  do  not  as  has  been  said  cover  any  part  of  the  sun  from  our 
eyes. 

It  is  said  that  the  stars  at  night  appear  most  brilliant  in  proportion  as 
they  are  higher  up,  and  that  if  they  have  no  light  of  their  own  the 
shadow  cast  by  the  earth  when  it  comes  between  them  and  the  sun 
would  come  to  darken  them,  since  these  stars  neither  see  nor  are  seen 
by  the  solar  body. 

But  those  who  say  this  have  not  considered  that  the  pyramidal 
shadow  of  the  earth  does  not  reach  many  of  the  stars,  and  that  in  those 
which  it  does  reach  the  pyramid  is  so  diminished  that  it  covers  little  of 
the  body  of  the  star,  and  all  the  rest  is  illuminated  by  the  sun. 

F57r. 

Why  the  planets  appear  greater  in  the  east  than  above  us,  though  it 
ought  to  be  the  opposite  seeing  that  they  are  three  thousand  five  hun- 
dred miles  nearer  to  us  when  they  are  in  the  middle  of  the  sky  than 
when  they  are  on  the  horizon: 

All  the  degrees  of  the  elements  through  which  pass  the  images  of 
the  celestial  bodies  which  come  to  the  eye  are  curved,  and  the  angles  by 
which  the  central  line  of  these  images  penetrates  there  are  unequal, 
and  the  distance  is  greater  as  is  shown  by  the  excess  of  a  b  over  a  d; 
and  by  the  Ninth  of  the  Sixth  the  size  of  heavenly  bodies  on  the  hori- 
zon is  proved.  f  60  r. 

Explain  the  earth  with  its  longer  and  shorter  day  in  the  north  and 
in  the  south,  and  do  the  same  for  the  moon  and  define  them  accurately.

DARKNESS  OF  SUN  MOON  AND  EARTH 

The  moon  has  its  days  and  nights  as  has  the  earth:  the  night  in  the 
part  which  does  not  shine  and  the  day  in  that  which  does. 

Here  the  night  of  the  moon  sees  the  light  of  the  earth,  that  is  to  say 
of  its  water,  grow  dim — and  the  darkened  water  sees  the  darkness  of 
the  sun,  and  to  the  night  of  the  moon  there  is  lacking  the  reverberation 
of  the  solar  rays  which  are  reflected  there  from  this  earth. 

In  this  other  figure  it  is  shown  that  the  day  of  the  moon  is  darkened 
and  the  night  of  the  earth  remains  deprived  of  the  solar  rays  reflected 
trom  the  moon.

When  the  moon  is  in  the  east  and  the  sun  in  the  west,  all  the  day  that 
the  moon  enjoyed,  such  as  it  was  with  the  sun  in  the  west,  is  changed 
into  night. 

Such  day  as  has  the  moon  which  from  the  east  looks  at  the  sun  in 
the  west  will  all  be  night  when  this  moon  is  with  the  sun  in  the  west.

OF  THE  RAINBOW 

Whether  the  rainbow  is  produced  by  the  eye,  that  is  its  curve,  or  by 
the  sun  by  means  of  the  cloud: 

The  mirror  does  not  take  any  images  except  those  of  visible  bodies, 
and  the  images  are  not  produced  without  these  bodies;  therefore  if  this 
arch  is  seen  in  the  mirror,  and  the  images  converge  there  which  have 
their  origin  in  this  rainbow,  it  follows  that  this  arch  is  produced  by  the 
sun  and  by  the  cloud. 

The  rainbow  is  seen  in  the  fine  rains  by  those  eyes  which  have  the 
sun  behind  and  the  cloud  in  front,  and  a  perpetually  straight  imaginary 
line  which  starts  from  the  centre  of  the  sun  and  passes  through  the 
centre  of  the  eye  will  end  in  the  centre  of  the  arch. 

And  this  arch  will  never  be  seen  by  one  eye  in  the  same  position 
as  by  the  other  eye;  it  will  be  seen  in  as  many  positions  of  the  cloud 
where  it  is  formed  as  there  are  eyes  that  see  it. 

Therefore  this  arch  is  all  in  all  the  cloud  where  it  is  produced,  and 
all  in  each  of  the  positions  in  which  it  may  find  itself,  and  so  it  will 
appear  larger  or  smaller,  half,  whole,  double,  triple. 

If  two  spheres  of  metal  transmit  the  solar  rays  into  a  dark  place,  as 
the  water  is  turned  into  vapour  it  will  make  the  solar  spectrum  *  long 
in  shape. 

This  occurs  also  with  the  water  turned  into  vapour  when  the  solar 
ray  is  passing  into  a  dark  place  with  the  sun  behind  it,  and  also  with 
the  light  of  torches  or  of  the  moon.  f  67  v. 

How  the  earth  in  performing  the  function  of  the  moon  has  lost  a 
considerable  amount  of  the  ancient  light  in  our  hemisphere  by  the  low- 
ering of  the  waters,  as  is  proved  in  Book  Four  'Of  the  Earth  and  the 
Waters':

ASTRONOMY  285 

The  earth  is  heavy  in  its  sphere,  but  so  much  the  more  as  it  is  in  a 
lighter  element. 

Fire  is  light  in  its  sphere,  and  so  much  the  more  as  it  is  in  a  heavier 
element. 

No  simple  element  has  gravity  or  levity  in  its  own  sphere,  and  if  a 
bladder  filled  with  air  weighs  more  in  the  scales  than  an  empty  one, 
this  is  because  this  air  is  compressed;  and  fire  might  be  so  compressed 
that  it  would  be  heavier  than  the  air  or  equal  to  the  air,  and  perhaps 
heavier  than  the  water,  and  making  itself  equal  to  the  earth,    f  69  v. 

This  will  follow  the  treatise  on  light  and  shade: 

The  extremities  of  the  moon  will  be  more  illuminated  and  will  show 
themselves  more  luminous  because  nothing  will  appear  in  them  except 
the  summits  of  the  waves  of  its  waters;  and  the  shadowy  depths  of  the 
valleys  of  these  waves  will  not  change  the  images  of  those  luminous 
parts  which  from  the  summits  of  these  waves  come  to  the  eye.

THE  SPOTS  ON  THE  MOON 

Some  have  said  that  vapours  are  given  ofi  from  the  moon  after  the 
manner  of  clouds,  and  are  interposed  between  the  moon  and  our  eyes. 
If  this  were  the  case  these  spots  would  never  be  fixed  either  as  to  posi- 
tion or  shape;  and  when  the  moon  was  seen  from  different  points,  even 
although  these  spots  did  not  alter  their  position,  they  would  change 
their  shape,  as  does  a  thing  which  is  seen  on  different  sides,      f  84  r. 

OF  THE  SPOTS  ON  THE  MOON 

Others  have  said  that  the  moon  is  made  up  of  parts,  some  more,  some 
less  transparent,  as  though  one  part  were  after  the  manner  of  alabaster, 
and  another  like  crystal  or  glass.  It  would  then  follow  that  when  the 
rays  of  the  sun  struck  the  less  transparent  part  the  light  would  stay  on 

1  Every  heavy  substance  presses  downwards,  and  thus  cannot  be  upheld  perpetually; 
wherefore  the  whole  earth  has  been  made  spherical. 


286  ASTRONOMY 

the  surface,  and  consequently  the  denser  part  would  be  illuminated, 
and  the  transparent  part  would  reveal  the  shadows  of  its  obscure  depths. 
Thus  then  they  define  the  nature  of  the  moon,  and  this  view  has  found 
favour  with  many  philosophers,  and  especially  with  Aristotle;  but 
nevertheless  it  is  false,  since  in  the  different  phases  which  the  moon  and 
the  sun  frequently  present  to  our  eyes  we  should  be  seeing  these  spots 
vary,  and  at  one  time  they  would  appear  dark  and  at  another  light. 
They  would  be  dark  when  the  sun  is  in  the  west  and  the  moon  in  the 
centre  of  the  sky,  because  the  transparent  hollows  would  then  be  in 
shadow,  as  far  as  the  tops  of  their  edges,  since  the  sun  could  not  cast 
its  rays  into  the  mouths  of  these  same  hollows;  and  they  would  appear 
bright  at  full  moon,  when  the  moon  in  the  east  faces  the  sun  in  the 
west;  for  then  the  sun  would  illumine  even  the  lowest  depths  of  these 
transparent  parts,  and  in  consequence  as  no  shadow  was  created,  the 
moon  would  not  at  such  times  reveal  to  us  the  above-mentioned  spots, 
and  so  it  would  be,  sometimes  more  sometimes  less,  according  to  the 
change  in  the  position  of  the  sun  to  the  moon,  and  of  the  moon  to  our 
eyes,  as  I  have  said  above.  f  84  v. 

It  has  also  been  said  that  the  spots  on  the  moon  are  created  in  the 
moon  itself,  by  the  fact  of  it  being  of  varying  thinness  or  density.  If  this 
were  so,  then  in  the  eclipses  of  the  moon  the  solar  rays  could  pierce 
through  some  part  where  it  is  thin,  as  has  been  stated,  but  since  we  do 
not  see  this  result  the  aforesaid  theory  is  false. 

Others  say  that  the  surface  of  the  moon  is  smooth  and  polished,  and 
that,  like  a  mirror,  it  receives  within  itself  the  reflection  of  the  earth. 
This  theory  is  false,  since  the  earth,  when  not  covered  by  the  water, 
presents  different  shapes  from  different  points  of  view;  so  when  the 
moon  is  in  the  east  it  would  reflect  other  spots  than  when  it  is  overhead 
or  in  the  west,  whereas  the  spots  upon  the  moon,  as  seen  at  full  moon, 
never  change  during  the  course  which  it  makes  in  our  hemisphere.  A 
second  reason  is  that  an  object  reflected  in  a  convex  surface  fills  only  a 
small  part  of  the  mirror,  as  is  proved  in  perspective.  The  third  reason  is 
that  when  the  moon  is  full  it  only  faces  half  the  orb  of  the  illuminated 
earth,  in  which  the  ocean  and  the  other  waters  shine  brightly,  while  the 
land  forms  spots  amid  this  brightness;  and  consequently  the  half  of  our 
earth  would  be  seen  girded  round  about  by  the  radiance  of  the  sea, 


ASTRONOMY  287 

which  takes  its  light  from  the  sun,  and  in  the  moon  this  reflection 
would  be  the  least  part  of  that  moon.  The  fourth  reason  is  that  one 
radiant  body  cannot  be  reflected  in  another,  and  consequently  as  tin  sea 
derives  its  radiance  from  the  sun,  as  does  also  the  moon,  it  could  not 
show  the  reflected  image  of  the  earth,  unless  one  also  saw  reflected 
there  separately  the  orb  of  the  sun  and  of  each  of  the  stars  which  look 
down  upon  it.  f  85  r. 

SOLAR  RAYS 

The  solar  rays  pass  through  the  cold  region  of  the  air  and  do  not 
change  their  nature.  They  pass  through  glasses  filled  with  cold  water 
and  lose  nothing  of  their  nature  thereby;  and  whatever  may  be  the 
transparent  place  through  which  they  pass  it  is  as  though  they  passed 
through  so  much  air. 

And  if  you  maintain  that  the  cold  rays  of  the  sun  are  clothed  with 
the  heat  of  fire  as  they  traverse  its  element,  just  as  they  assume  the 
colour  of  the  glass  they  penetrate,  it  would  follow  that  in  penetrating 
the  cold  region  they  put  on  this  mantle  of  cold  after  they  have  already 
put  on  the  said  mantle  of  heat,  and  thus  the  cold  would  counteract  the 
heat,  and  therefore  the  solar  rays  would  come  to  us  deprived  of  heat, 
and  as  this  is  not  confirmed  by  experience  such  method  of  reasoning  as 
to  the  sun  being  cold  is  vain. 

But  if  you  were  to  say  that  the  cold  through  which  the  fiery  rays  of 
the  sun  pass  somewhat  modifies  the  excessive  heat  of  these  rays  it 
would  follow  from  this  that  one  would  feel  greater  heat  on  the  high 
peaks  of  the  Caucasus  the  mountain  of  Scythia  than  in  the  valleys, 
because  the  mountain  towers  above  the  middle  regions  of  the  air,  and 
no  clouds  are  found  there  nor  anything  that  grows. 

And  if  you  say  that  these  solar  rays  thrust  towards  us  the  element  of 
fire  from  whence  they  pass  by  local  movement,  this  cannot  be  admitted 
because  the  local  movement  of  such  [a  volume  of]  air  cannot  occur 
without  the  passing  of  a  period  of  time,  and  this  is  greater  in  propor- 
tion as  the  sun  is  more  on  the  horizon,  for  when  there  it  is  3,500  miles 
farther  away  from  us  than  when  it  is  in  the  centre  of  our  heaven.  If  it 
acted  thus  it  would  cool  the  part  of  our  horizon  opposite  to  it,  because 
it  would  carry  away  in  its  rays  such  part  of  the  element  of  fire  opposite 
to  it  as  it  penetrated. 


288  ASTRONOMY 

If  the  lesser  fire  is  attracted  to  and  deflected  by  the  greater  fire  as  one 
sees  happen  by  experience,  it  must  needs  be  that  the  sun  draws  the 
element  of  fire  to  itself  rather  than  that  it  banishes  it  from  itself  and 
drives  it  towards  us. 

And  the  heat  of  the  fire  does  not  descend  unless  it  follows  burning 
matter,  and  in  acting  thus  it  is  material  and  in  consequence  it  is  visible. 

f  86  r. 

How  if  the  moon  is  polished  and  spherical  the  image  of  the  sun  upon 
it  is  powerfully  luminous,  and  is  only  on  a  small  part  of  its  surface: 

You  will  see  the  proof  of  this  by  taking  a  ball  of  burnished  gold  and 
placing  it  in  the  darkness  and  setting  a  light  at  some  distance  from  it. 
Although  this  illuminates  about  half  the  ball,  the  eye  only  sees  it  re- 
flected on  a  small  part  of  its  surface,  and  all  the  rest  of  the  surface 
reflects  the  darkness  which  surrounds  it.  For  this  reason  it  is  only  there 
that  the  image  of  the  light  is  apparent,  and  all  the  rest  remains  invisi- 
ble because  the  eye  is  at  a  distance  from  the  ball.  The  same  thing 
would  happen  with  the  surface  of  the  moon  if  it  were  polished,  glitter- 
ing and  solid,  as  are  bodies  which  have  a  reflecting  surface.

EXPLANATION  OF  THE  MOON  WITH  THE  IMAGE 

OF  THE  SUN 

If  the  sun  /  reflected  in  the  surface  of  the  water  n  m  should  seem  to  be 
at  d  (that  is  to  say  seems  to  be  as  far  below  the  water  as  it  is  above),  and 
to  the  eye  b  appears  to  be  of  the  size  a,  and  this  image  doubles  itself 


ASTRONOMY  289 

as  the  eye  is  removed  from  b  to  c\  how  much  would  this  Image  grow  it 
the  eye  were  removed  Erom  c  to  the  moon? 

Work  with  the  rule  of  three  and  you  will  see  that  the  light  which 
there  is  in  the  moon  on  its  fifteenth  day  can  never  be  the  light  that  this 
moon  receives  from  it  being  spherical;  therefore  it  is  necessary  that  this 
moon  contains  water.  c  20  r. 


[Of  the  nature  of  the  suns  heat] 

OF  THE  PROOF  THAT  THE  SUN  IS  HOT  BY  NATURE 
AND  NOT  BY  POWER 

That  the  sun  is  hot  in  itself  by  nature  and  not  by  power  is  shown 
very  distinctly  by  the  radiance  of  the  solar  body  on  which  the  human 
eye  cannot  continue  to  look.  And  this  moreover  the  rays  reflected  by 
concave  mirrors  show  very  clearly,  for  when  their  percussion  is  of  such 
radiance  that  the  eye  cannot  endure  it,  this  percussion  will  have  a  radi- 
ance resembling  that  of  the  sun  in  its  own  position.  And  the  truth  of 
this  is  proved  by  the  fact  that  if  such  a  mirror  has  such  a  concave  sur- 
face as  is  required  in  order  to  produce  this  ray,  no  created  thing  will 
be  able  to  support  the  heat  of  such  percussion  of  ray  reflected  from 
any  mirror.  And  if  you  say  that  the  mirror  also  is  cold  and  yet  throws 
warm  rays,  I  say  in  reply  that  the  ray  comes  from  the  sun  and  will 
have  to  pass  through  the  mirror  in  order  to  resemble  its  cause  and  can 
pass  through  whatever  medium  it  wishes.  .  .  . 

The  ray  of  the  concave  mirror  having  passed  across  the  windows  of 
the  furnaces  where  are  cast  .  .  .  has  not  great  heat  nor  any  longer  has 
whiteness.  g  34  r. 

THE  SOLAR  RAYS 

Where  there  is  the  finer  and  more  rarefied  medium  the  solar  rays 
meet  with  a  less  resistance  and  where  there  is  the  less  resistance  it  is 
less  permeated  by  the  nature  of  the  agent.  Consequently  for  this  reason 
one  may  infer  that  where  the  air  is  more  rarefied  the  percussion  of  the 
said  solar  rays  transmits  less  radiance,  and  as  a  consequence  it  is  darker , 
and  so  also  conversely.  k  118   [38]   r. 


290  ASTRONOMY 

A  proof  how  the  nearer  you  are  to  the  source  of  the  sun's  rays  the 
greater  will  the  sun  appear  when  reflected  upon  the  sea: 

If  the  sun  produces  its  radiance  from  its  centre  fortified  by  power 
from  the  whole  body  it  must  needs  be  that  the  farther  its  rays  proceed 
from  it  the  more  they  go  on  separating.  This  being  so  when  you  have 
your  eye  near  water  that  reflects  the  sun,  you  see  a  very  small  part  of 
the  sun's  rays  carrying  upon  the  surface  of  the  water  the  form  of  the 
sun  reflected;  and  if  you  are  nearer  to  the  sun  as  would  be  the  case 
when  the  sun  is  at  the  meridian  and  the  sea  is  to  the  west,  you  will  see 
the  sun  reflected  in  the  sea  of  very  great  size,  because  as  you  are  nearer 
to  the  sun  your  eye  as  it  takes  the  rays  near  to  the  point  takes  in  more 
of  them  and  so  greater  radiance  ensues.  For  this  reason  it  might  be 
proved  that  the  moon  is  another  world  similar  to  ours,  and  that  the 
part  of  it  which  shines  is  a  sea  that  reflects  the  sun  and  the  part  which 
does  not  shine  is  earth.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  16  v. 

If  you  keep  the  details  of  the  spots  of  the  moon  under  observation 
you  will  often  find  great  differences  in  them,  and  I  have  myself  proved 
this  by  making  drawings  of  them.  And  this  comes  about  because  the 
clouds  rise  from  the  waters  of  the  moon  and  come  between  the  sun  and 
this  water,  and  with  their  shadows  cut  off  the  rays  of  the  sun  from  it, 
and  consequently  it  remains  dark  because  it  cannot  reflect  the  solar 
body.  b.m.  19  r. 

OF  THE  MOON 

As  wishing  to  treat  of  the  nature  of  the  moon  it  is  necessary  in  the 
first  place  that  I  should  describe  the  perspective  of  mirrors,  whether 
flat  concave  or  convex,  and  first  of  all  what  is  meant  by  a  luminous  ray 
and  how  it  is  refracted  by  various  kinds  of  media.  Then  whether  the 
reflected  ray  is  more  powerful  if  the  angle  of  incidence  be  acute  or  a 
right  angle  or  obtuse,  or  if  the  surface  be  convex  or  flat  or  concave, 
or  the  substance  opaque  or  transparent.  Furthermore  how  it  is  that  the 
solar  rays  which  strike  the  waves  of  the  sea  show  themselves  of  the 
same  width  in  the  angle  close  to  the  eye  as  in  the  farthest  crest  of  the 
waves  on  the  horizon,  notwithstanding  which  the  solar  radiance  re- 
flected by  the  waves  of  the  sea  is  of  the  shape  of  a  pyramid,  and  as  a 


ASTRONOMY  291 

consequence  at  every  stage  of  distance  acquires  an  access  of  breadth, 
although  to  our  sight  it  may  appear  parallel. 

Nothing  extremely  light  is  opaque. 

Nothing  that  is  lighter  remains  below  what  is  less  light. 

Whether  the  moon  has  its  station  in  the  midst  of  its  elements  or  no. 

If  it  has  not  a  particular  station  as  has  the  earth  in  its  elements  why 
it  does  not  fall  to  the  centre  of  our  elements. 

And  if  the  moon  is  not  in  the  midst  of  its  elements  and  does  not 
descend  it  is  therefore  lighter  than  the  other  element. 

And  if  the  moon  is  lighter  than  the  other  element  why  it  is  solid  and 
not  transparent. 

Of  things  of  different  size  which  when  placed  at  different  distances 
show  themselves  equal,  there  will  be  the  same  proportion  between 
their  distances  as  there  is  between  their  sizes.  b.m.  94  r. 

OF  THE  MOON 

The  moon  has  no  light  of  itself  but  so  much  of  it  as  the  sun  sees,  it 
illuminates.  Of  this  illuminated  part  we  see  as  much  as  faces  us.  And 
its  night  receives  as  much  brightness  as  our  waters  lend  it  as  they  reflect 
upon  it  the  image  of  the  sun,  which  is  mirrored  in  all  those  waters 
that  face  the  sun  and  the  moon. 

The  crust  or  surface  of  the  water  of  which  the  sea  of  the  moon  and 
the  sea  of  our  earth  are  composed  is  always  wrinkled  whether  little  or 
much  or  more  or  less;  and  this  ruggedness  is  the  cause  of  the  expansion 
of  the  innumerable  images  of  the  sun  which  are  reflected  in  the  hills 
and  valleys  and  sides  and  crests  of  the  innumerable  furrows,  that  is  in 
as  many  different  spots  in  each  furrow  as  there  are  different  positions 
of  the  eyes  that  see  them.  This  could  not  happen  if  the  sphere  of  water 
which  in  great  part  covers  the  moon  were  of  uniform  roundness,  be- 
cause then  there  would  be  an  image  of  the  sun  for  every  eye,  and  its 
reflection  would  be  distinct  and  the  radiance  of  it  would  always  be 
spherical  in  shape,  as  is  clearly  shown  in  the  gilded  balls  placed  on  the 
summits  of  lofty  buildings.  But  if  these  gilded  balls  were  furrowed  or 
made  up  of  many  small  globules  like  mulberries,  which  are  a  black 
fruit  composed  of  minute  round  balls,  then  each  of  the  parts  of  this 
rounded  mass  visible  to  the  sun  and  to  the  eye  will  reveal  to  the  eye 


292  ASTRONOMY 

the  radiance  produced  by  the  reflection  of  the  sun.  And  thus  in  the 
same  body  there  will  be  seen  many  minute  suns  and  very  often  on 
account  of  their  great  distance  they  will  blend  one  with  another  and 
seem  continuous. 

The  lustre  of  the  new  moon  is  brighter  and  more  powerful  than 
when  it  is  full;  and  this  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  angle  of  its  incidence 
is  much  more  obtuse  in  the  new  moon  than  in  the  full  moon,  where 
the  angles  are  extremely  acute,  and  the  waves  of  the  moon  reflect  the 
sun  both  on  their  hollows  and  on  their  crests,  and  the  sides  remain 
dark.  But  at  the  sides  of  the  moon  the  troughs  of  the  waves  do  not  see 
the  sun,  for  it  only  sees  the  crests  of  these  waves,  and  in  consequence 
the  reflections  are  less  frequent  and  more  mingled  with  the  shadows  of 
the  valleys.  And  this  intermixture  of  shaded  and  luminous  images  all 
blending  together  comes  to  the  eye  with  only  a  moderate  amount  of 
radiance,  and  at  its  edges  it  will  be  even  darker,  because  the  curve  of 
the  side  of  these  waves  will  be  insufficient  to  reflect  the  rays  which  it 
receives  to  the  eye. 

For  which  reason  the  new  moon  by  its  nature  reflects  the  solar  rays 
more  towards  the  eye  through  these  last  waves  than  through  any  other 
place,  as  is  shown  by  the  figure  of  the  moon  striking  with  the  rays  a  on 
the  wave  b  and  reflected  in  b  d  where  the  eye  d  is  situated.  And  this 
cannot  happen  at  full  moon,  where  the  solar  ray  standing  in  the  west, 
strikes  the  last  rays  of  the  moon  in  the  east  from  n  to  m,  and  does  not 
reflect  towards  the  eye  in  the  west;  but  leaps  back  to  the  east,  slightly 
bending  the  direction  of  this  solar  ray;  and  so  the  angle  of  the  incidence 
is  very  great. 

The  countless  images  which  are  reflected  by  the  innumerable  waves 
of  the  sea  from  the  solar  rays  that  strike  upon  these  waves,  cause  a 
continuous  and  far  reaching  splendour  upon  the  surface  of  the  sea. 

The  moon  is  an  opaque  and  solid  body,  and  if  on  the  contrary  it 
were  transparent  it  would  not  receive  the  light  of  the  sun.  b.m.  94  v. 

You  have  to  prove  how  the  earth  performs  all  those  same  functions 
towards  the  moon  which  the  moon  does  towards  the  earth.

because  the  moon  x  does  not  receive  the  light  of  the  sun  on  its  surface

mingling  of  the  shadows  which  arc  above  the  waves  that  shed  the  radi-

To  observe  the  nature  of  the  planets  have  an  opening  made  in  the

so  that  this  base  only  reflects  one  at  a  time.  b.m.  279  v. 

The  circles  of  the  celestial  spheres  together  with  the  elements  equally 
drive  and  thrust  away  from  themselves  everything  that  has  weight, 
whence  for  this  reason  it  must  be  confessed  that  it  is  necessary  for  the 
centres  of  these  spheres  to  meet  and  become  stationary. 

Whence  through  this  it  is  necessary  to  confess  that  the  things  falling 
towards  the  centre  are  rather  thrust  from  above  than  drawn  by  this 
centre  downwards;  because  if  it  were  possible  that  this  earth  should 
be  withdrawn  in  part  in  such  a  manner  that  the  space  occupied  by  the 
position  of  the  earth  were  filled  with  air,  you  would  see  a  stone  thrown 
off  from  our  world  into  this  air  become  stationary  in  the  centre  of  the 
two  elements  and  of  the  spheres.  Forster  111  6  v. 

The  centre  of  the  world  cannot  be  the  centre  of  the  universal  circles 
made  by  the  course  of  the  glittering  stars,  because  in  a  like  position  it 
cannot  be  taken  for  granted  that  the  universal  parts  of  the  earth,  the 
encompasser  and  enveloper  of  this  centre,  are  not  of  equal  weight  when 
removed  at  an  equal  distance  from  this  centre. 

Naturally  every  heavy  thing  is  thrust  towards  the  centre  because  the 
centre  is  farthest  removed  from  these  expelling  and  rotatory  forces. 

I  conclude:  the  centre  of  the  weight  of  the  earth  with  the  water  is 
the  centre  of  the  spheres  and  not  the  centre  of  the  mass  of  this  world. 

Forster  m   7  r. 

These  heavy  parts  which  were  thrust  down  from  there  above,  have

If  you  wish  to  prove  that  the  moon  appears  larger  than  it  is  when  it

the  earth  and  convex  towards  the  fire.     Windsor:  Drawings  12326  v.

Reply  to  Maestro  Andrea  da  Imola  who  said  that  the  solar  rays 
reflected  by  the  surface  of  the  convex  mirror  intermingled  and  became 
lost  at  a  short  distance,  and  that  for  this  reason  it  is  altogether  denied 
that  the  luminous  side  of  the  moon  is  of  the  nature  of  a  mirror,  and 
that  in  consequence  this  light  is  not  produced  by  the  innumerable  muL 
titude  of  the  waves  of  that  sea,  which  I  have  demonstrated  to  be  that 
part  of  the  moon  which  is  illuminated  by  the  solar  rays.        Leic.  1  v. 

OF  THE  MOON 

No  solid  body  is  lighter  than  air. 

As  we  have  proved  that  the  part  of  the  moon  which  shines  consists 
of  water  and  it  serves  the  body  of  the  sun  as  a  mirror  which  reflects  the 
radiance  it  receives  from  it;  and  that  if  this  water  were  without  waves 
it  would  show  itself  as  small  but  of  a  radiance  almost  equal  to  that  of 
the  sun,  it  is  necessary  now  to  show  whether  the  moon  is  a  heavy  or 
light  body.  Thus  if  it  were  a  heavy  body — considering  that  in  progres- 
sion upwards  from  the  earth  at  every  stage  of  altitude  there  is  an 
accession  of  lightness,  inasmuch  as  water  is  lighter  than  earth,  air  than 


ASTRONOMY  295 

water  and  fire  than  air  and  so  continuing  in  succession — it  would  set  m 
that  if  the  moon  had  density,  as  it  has,  it  would  have  weight,  and  that 
having  weight  the  space  in  which  it  finds  itself  would  not  be  able  to 
support  it,  and  as  a  consequence  it  would  have  to  descend  towards  the 
centre  of  the  universe  and  to  join  itself  to  the  earth;  or  if  not  the  moon 
itself  its  waters  at  any  rate  would  fall  away  and  become  lost  to  it  and 
would  fall  towards  the  centre  leaving  the  moon  stripped  of  them  and 
devoid  of  radiance.  The  fact  however  that  these  events  do  not  occur 
as  might  with  reason  have  been  anticipated  is  a  clear  sign  that  the 
moon  is  clothed  with  her  own  elements,  namely  water  air  and  fire  and 
so  sustains  itself  by  itself  in  that  part  of  space  as  does  our  earth  with 
its  elements  in  this  other  part  of  space;  and  that  the  heavy  bodies  per- 
form the  same  function  in  its  elements  which  the  other  heavy  bodies 
do  in  ours. 
[Diagratn]  sun,  moon,  earth. 

When  the  eye  in  the  east  sees  the  moon  in  the  west  near  the  setting 
sun  it  sees  it  with  its  shaded  part  surrounded  by  the  luminous  part;  of 
which  light  the  lateral  and  upper  portions  are  derived  from  the  sun 
and  the  lower  portion  from  the  western  ocean,  which  still  receives  the 
solar  rays  and  reflects  them  in  the  lower  seas  of  the  moon,  and  more- 
over it  imparts  as  much  radiance  to  the  whole  of  the  shaded  part  of 
the  moon  as  the  moon  gives  to  the  earth  at  midnight,  and  for  this 
reason  it  does  not  become  absolutely  dark.  And  from  this  some  have 
believed  that  the  moon  has  in  part  a  light  of  its  own  in  addition  to  that 
which  is  given  it  by  the  sun,  and  that  this  light  is  due  to  the  cause 
already  mentioned,  namely  that  our  seas  are  illumined  by  the  sun. 
[Diagram]  moon,  solar  body,  earth. 

Further  it  might  be  said  that  the  circle  of  radiance  which  the  moon 
shows  when  it  is  in  the  west  together  with  the  sun  is  derived  entirely 
from  the  sun,  when  its  position  with  regard  to  the  sun  and  the  eye  is 
as  is  shown  above. 

Some  might  say  that  the  air  which  is  an  element  of  the  moon  as  it 
catches  the  light  of  the  sun  as  does  our  atmosphere  was  that  which 
completes  the  luminous  circle  on  the  body  of  the  moon. 

Some  have  believed  that  the  moon  has  some  light  of  its  own,  but  this 
opinion  is  false,  for  they  have  based  it  upon  that  glimmer  which  is 
visible  in  the  middle  between  the  horns  of  the  new  moon,  which  ap- 


296  ASTRONOMY 

pears  dark  where  it  borders  on  the  bright  part,  and  where  it  borders 
on  the  darkness  of  the  background  seems  so  bright  that  many  have 
assumed  it  to  be  a  ring  of  new  radiance  which  completes  the  circle 
where  the  radiance  of  the  tips  of  the  horns  illuminated  by  the  sun 
ceases. 

And  this  difference  in  the  background  arises  from  the  fact  that  the 
part  of  it  which  borders  on  the  illuminated  portion  of  the  moon,  by 
comparison  with  that  brightness  shows  itself  darker  than  it  is,  and  in 
the  part  above  where  appears  a  portion  of  a  luminous  circle  of  uniform 
breadth  it  comes  about  that  there  the  moon  being  brighter  than  the 
medium  or  background  upon  which  it  finds  itself,  in  comparison  with 
this  darkness  shows  itself  on  that  extremity  brighter  than  it  is,  this 
brightness  at  such  a  time  being  derived  from  our  ocean  and  the  other 
inland  seas,  for  they  are  at  that  time  illumined  by  the  sun  which  is 
then  on  the  point  of  setting,  in  such  a  way  that  the  sea  then  performs 
the  same  office  for  the  dark  side  of  the  moon  as  the  moon  when  at  the 
full  does  for  us  when  the  sun  is  set,  and  there  is  the  same  proportion 
between  that  small  quantity  of  light  on  the  dark  side  of  the  moon  and 
the  brightness  of  the  illuminated  part,  as  there  is  between  .  .  . 

If  you  want  to  see  how  much  brighter  the  shaded  part  of  the  moon  is 
than  its  background,  cover  from  your  eye  with  your  hand  or  with  some 
other  object  farther  away  the  luminous  part  of  the  moon,  so  that  .  .  . 

Leic.  2  r. 

I  say  that  as  the  moon  has  no  light  of  its  own,  but  is  luminous,  it 
must  needs  be  that  this  light  is  caused  by  some  other  body:  this  being 
so  it  is  of  the  nature  of  a  spherical  mirror;  and  if  it  is  spherical  it  takes 
the  light  pyramid-wise;  and  of  this  pyramid  the  sun  is  the  base,  and  its 
angle  ends  in  the  centre  of  the  body  of  the  moon,  and  it  is  cut  by  the 
surface  of  this  body,  and  only  takes  as  much  as  corresponds  to  the 
section  of  this  pyramid  on  its  surface.  And  to  the  human  eye  this  moon 
would  only  seem  the  size  of  this  section  of  the  pyramid.  Whence  there 
would  follow  from  the  light  of  the  moon  the  contrary  effect  to  that 
which  experience  shows  us;  for  this  is  that  as  the  moon  turns  it  has  its 
whole  orb  luminous  as  is  shown  us  by  this;  for  this  clearly  shows  us 
that  this  lunar  body  has  more  than  half  its  orb  illuminated.  But  this 
would  not  happen  if  it  were  a  polished  body  like  the  mirrors;  conse- 
quently for  this  reason  we  are  constrained  to  admit,  by  my  fifth  [rule], 


ASTRONOMY  297 

that  the  surface  of  the  moon  is  furrowed;  and  this  muchness  only 
exists  in  liquid  bodies  when  they  are  stirred  by  the  wind,  as  we  have 
seen  with  the  sea  how  the  sun  is  reflected  by  tiny  waves  near  to  the 
eve,  and  stage  bv  stage  over  a  distance  of  more  than  forty  miles  these 
illuminated  waves  grow  larger.  Wherefore  we  conclude  that  the  lumi- 
nous part  of  the  moon  is  water,  which  if  it  were  not  in  movement 
would  not  be  luminous  to  the  same  degree;  but  by  the  movement  of 
this  water  which  has  been  stirred  up  by  the  winds  it  becomes  filled 
with  waves;  and  every  wave  takes  the  light  from  the  sun;  and  the 
great  multitude  of  waves  beyond  number  reflect  the  solar  body  an 
infinite  number  of  times;  and  the  sun  thus  reflected  will  be  as  bright 
as  the  sun,  for  as  is  seen  when  the  water  does  not  move  it  gives  back 
the  sun  to  the  eye  in  the  pristine  splendour  that  it  has  by  nature. 

But  the  shadows  also  are  beyond  number  as  well  as  the  waves,  and 
these  are  interspersed  between  the  waves;  and  their  shapes  blend  with 
the  shapes  of  the  images  of  the  sun,  which  are  upon  the  waves;  and 
each  shadow  shape  becomes  blended  with  a  luminous  shape  and  so 
they  come  to  obscure  the  luminous  rays  and  make  them  weak,  as  is 
clearly  shown  us  by  the  light  of  the  moon.  And  when  the  sea  of  the 
moon  is  stirred  to  tempest  by  the  winds  the  waves  are  larger  and  the 
lights  less  frequent  and  the  enlarged  shadows  intermingle  more  with 
the  sparse  images  of  the  sun  upon  the  waves,  and  for  this  reason  the 
moon  becomes  less  luminous.  But  when  the  moon  is  in  its  circle  and 
has  a  position  at  about  the  centre  of  our  hemisphere,  each  wave  shows 
the  reflection  of  the  sun  both  in  the  centre  of  the  valleys  interposed 
between  the  waves  and  in  the  summits  of  these  waves;  and  for  this 
reason  the  moon  shows  itself  more  luminous  than  ever,  through  hav- 
ing the  number  of  the  parts  in  light  doubled. 

It  shows  itself  also  strongly  luminous  a  short  time  after  its  turn, 
because  the  sun  which  stands  beyond  the  moon,  striking  the  waves 
upon  their  summits,  when  these  summits  are  near  together  and  seem 
almost  to  clash  one  against  another  when  the  eye  is  on  this  side,  causes 
the  shadows  which  come  between  the  waves  not  to  transmit  to  the  eye 
their  images  mingled  with  the  luminous  images;  and  for  this  reason  the 
light  of  the  moon  is  more  powerful. 

And  what  is  proved  of  one  luminous  body  holds  true  of  all  the  rest.

Of  the  moon:  all  the  objections  of  the  adversary,  to  say  that  in  the 
moon  there  is  no  water. 

Objection:  Every  body  thicker  than  the  air  is  heavier  than  this  air 
and  cannot  be  supported  upon  it  without  other  cause;  and  the  more  it 
rises  the  less  it  is  resisted  by  its  medium:  therefore,  if  there  were  water 
in  the  moon,  it  would  despoil  the  moon  of  itself,  and  would  come  to 
cover  our  earth,  because  in  this  moon  the  water  would  be  above  its  air. 
Here  the  answer  is  that  if  there  is  water  in  the  moon  there  is  also  earth 
there  upon  which  this  water  supports  itself,  and  consequently  the  other 
elements:  and  water  is  supported  up  there  among  the  three  other  ele- 
ments, as  down  here  our  water  is  among  its  accompanying  elements; 
if  however  as  the  adversary  holds  the  water  had  to  fall  from  the  moon, 
it  would  rather  be  that  the  moon  would  have  to  fall  as  being  a  body 
heavier  than  the  water;  therefore  not  falling  it  is  a  clear  proof  that  the 
water  up  there  and  the  earth  are  supported  with  their  other  elements 
just  as  the  heavy  and  light  elements  down  here  are  supported  in  space 
that  is  lighter  than  themselves. 

The  adversary  says  that  the  light  of  the  moon,  if  not  the  whole  of 
it,  is  the  same  in  itself;  and  that  it  shows  itself  more  or  less  illuminated, 
according  as  the  eye  sees  more  or  less  of  its  shaded  part,  that  is,  if  it  is 
more  in  the  east  than  the  west.

'All  seeds  have  the  umbilical  cord,  which  breads 

when  the  seed  is  ripe.  And  in  lih^e  mariner  they 

have  matrix  and  secundina,  as  is  seen  in  herbs 

and  all  the  seeds  which  grow  in  pods! 

When  a  tree  has  had  part  of  its  bark  stripped  off,  nature  in  order  tc 
provide  for  it  supplies  to  the  stripped  portion  a  far  greater  quantity  of 
nutritive  moisture  than  to  any  other  part;  so  that  because  of  the  first 
scarcity  which  has  been  referred  to  the  bark  there  grows  much  more 
thickly  than  in  any  other  place.  And  this  moisture  has  such  power  of 
movement  that  after  having  reached  the  spot  where  its  help  is  needed, 
it  raises  itself  partly  up  like  a  ball  rebounding,  and  makes  various 
buddings  and  sproutings,  somewhat  after  the  manner  of  water  when 
it  boils. 

Many  trees  planted  in  such  a  way  as  to  touch,  by  the  second  year 
will  have  learnt  how  to  dispense  with  the  bark  which  grows  between 
them  and  become  grafted  together;  and  by  this  method  you  will  make 
the  walls  of  the  gardens  continuous,  and  in  four  years  you  will  even 
have  very  wide  boards. 

When  many  grains  or  seeds  are  sown  so  that  they  touch  and  are  then 
covered  by  a  board  filled  with  holes  the  size  of  the  seeds  and  left  to 
grow  underneath  it,  the  seeds  as  they  germinate  will  become  fixed 
together  and  will  form  a  beautiful  clump.  And  if  you  mix  seeds  of 
different  kinds  together  this  clump  will  seem  like  jasper.

[Of  barring  trees] 

If  you  take  away  a  ring  of  bark  from  the  tree  d  it  will  wither  from 
the  ring  upwards  and  all  below  will  remain  alive. 

If  you  make  the  said  ring  incompletely  and  then  graft  the  plant  near 
the  foot  deftly,  the  part  that  has  been  deftly  treated  will  be  preserved 
and  the  rest  will  be  spoilt.  b  17  v. 


OF  THE  RAMIFICATION  OF  PLANTS 

The  plants  which  spread  out  very  much  have  the  angles  of  the  divi- 
sions which  separate  their  ramifications  more  obtuse  in  proportion  as 
their  point  of  origin  is  lower  down,  that  is  nearer  to  the  thicker  and 
older  part  of  the  tree;  whereas  in  the  newer  part  of  the  tree  the  angles 
of  its  ramifications  are  more  acute.  e  6  v. 

The  trunks  of  the  trees  have  a  bulbous  surface  which  is  caused  by 
their  roots  which  carry  nourishment  to  the  tree;  and  these  excrescences 
have  their  surface  of  bark  containing  few  fissures,  and  their  intervals 
are  hollows  where  the  bark  has  become  dried  because  the  nourishment 
comes  to  it  less  abundantly.  g  1  r. 

The  shadows  on  transparent  leaves  seen  from  beneath  are  the  same 
as  those  on  the  right  side  of  the  leaf,  for  the  shadow  is  visible  in  trans- 
parence on  the  under  side  as  well  as  the  part  in  light;  but  the  lustre  can 
never  be  seen  in  transparence.  g  3  v.

BOTANY  301 

OF  BRANCH  STRUCTURE 

The  beginning  of  the  branch  will  always  have  the  central  line  of  its 
thickness  taking  its  direction  by  the  central  line  of  the  plant,    g  14  r. 


OF  THE  BIRTH  OF  LEAVES  UPON  THEIR  BRANCHES 

The  thickness  of  a  branch  is  never  diminished  in  the  space  there  is 
between  one  leaf  and  another  except  by  as  much  as  the  thickness  of  the 
eye  that  is  above  the  leaf,  and  this  thickness  is  lacking  in  the  branch 
up  to  the  next  leaf. 

Nature  has  arranged  the  leaves  of  the  latest  branches  of  many  plants 
so  that  the  sixth  is  always  above  the  first,  and  so  it  follows  in  succession 
if  the  rule  is  not  impeded. 

This  serves  two  uses  for  the  plants,  the  first  being  that  as  the  branch 
or  fruit  springs  in  the  following  year  from  the  bud  or  eye  which  is  above 
it  in  contact  with  the  attachment  of  the  leaf,  the  water  which  wets  this 
branch  is  able  to  descend  to  nourish  the  eye  by  the  fact  that  the  drops 
are  caught  in  the  axil  where  the  leaf  springs;  and  the  second  use  is 
that  when  these  branches  grow  in  the  succeeding  year  one  will  not 
cover  the  other,  because  the  five  branches  come  forth  turned  in  five 
different  directions  and  the  sixth  comes  forth  above  the  first  but  at  a 
sufficient  distance.  g  16  v. 

[Of  branch  structure] 

Between  one  ramification  and  the  other  if  there  are  no  other  par- 
ticular branches  the  tree  will  be  of  uniform  thickness.  And  this  takes 
place  because  the  whole  sum  of  the  humour  that  feeds  the  beginning 
of  this  branch  continues  to  feed  it  until  it  produces  the  next  branch. 
And  this  nourishment  or  equal  cause  produces  equal  effect,      g  17  r. 

Trees  which  divide  near  to  the  ground  seldom  put  forth  branches  in 
the  space  that  intervenes  between  them;  and  if  however  there  should  be 
one  it  will  have  but  a  short  life  and  will  not  make  much  growth  on 
account  of  the  shadow  that  the  one  gives  to  the  other. 

There  are  many  bends  in  the  branches  where  there  are  none  of  the 
six  lesser  branches  that  usually  surround  them;  for  these  failed  in  their

youth,  and  death  passed  over  their  stumps  and  spread  to  the  more  vital 
parts. 

The  principal  branches  of  the  trees  which  rise  the  most  are  always 
nearer  the  centre  of  the  plant  than  any  of  its  brothers  or  sons. 

G  24   V. 

The  small  branches  of  the  same  year  grow  in  all  the  parts  of  the 
tree  only  in  those  places  where  there  were  its  old  ramifications,  pro- 
duced in  the  order  of  the  birth  of  their  leaves,  that  is  to  say  each  is 
produced  the  one  above  the  other. 

The  occasional  dents  in  the  big  branches  of  trees  are  not  in  the  same 
order  as  that  of  the  inception  of  the  leaves  which  are  near  to  them. 

Because  its  lesser  branches  never  traverse  such  dents  in  their  infancy 
the  chief  branch  as  it  carries  more  sap  keeps  its  course  straight  for  a 
long  space.  c  25  r. 

DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  ELM 

This  ramification  of  the  elm  has  the  largest  branch  in  front,  and  its 
smallest  are  the  first  and  the  penultimate  when  the  chief  branch  is 
straight. 

From  the  starting  point  of  one  leaf  to  the  other  is  the  half  of  the 
greatest  length  of  the  leaf;  a  little  less  because  the  leaves  form  an  inter- 
val which  is  about  a  third  the  width  of  the  leaf. 

The  elm  has  the  tips  of  its  leaves  nearer  the  extremity  of  the  branch 
than  its  starting  point,  and  in  width  they  vary  but  little  when  looked 
at  from  the  same  side.  g  27  r. 

The  leaf  always  turns  its  upper  side  towards  the  sky  so  that  it  may 
be  better  able  to  receive  over  its  whole  surface  the  dew  which  drops 
down  with  the  slow  movement  of  the  atmosphere;  and  these  leaves  are 
arranged  on  the  plants  in  such  a  way  that  one  covers  another  as  little 
as  possible,  but  they  lie  alternately  one  above  the  other  as  is  seen  with 
the  ivy  which  covers  the  walls.  And  this  alternation  serves  two  ends; 
that  is  in  order  to  leave  spaces  so  that  the  air  and  the  sun  may  penetrate 
between  them, — and  the  second  purpose  of  it  is  that  the  drops  which 
fall  from  the  first  leaf  may  fall  on  to  the  fourth,  or  on  to  the  sixth  in 
the  case  of  other  trees.  g  27  v. 


BOTANY  303 

[Structure  of  the  walnut  tree] 

The  leaves  of  the  walnut  tree  are  distributed  over  the  whole  branch 
of  that  year,  and  they  are  so  much  farther  away  the  one  from  the  other, 
and  in  greater  number,  as  the  branch  from  which  the  shoot  springs  is 
younger.  And  they  are  so  much  nearer  at  their  beginning  and  less  in 
number,  as  the  shoot  that  bears  them  springs  from  an  older  branch. 

Its  fruits  grow  at  the  extremity  of  its  shoot,  and  its  largest  branches 
are  on  the  under  side  of  the  bough  from  which  they  spring.  And  this 
happens  because  the  weight  of  its  sap  inclines  it  more  to  descend  than 
to  rise;  and  for  this  reason  the  branches  that  start  above  them  and  go 
toward  the  sky  are  small  and  thin.  When  the  shoot  looks  towards  the 
sky  its  leaves  spread  out  from  its  extremity  with  equal  distribution  of 
their  tips,  and  if  the  shoot  looks  towards  the  horizon  the  leaves  remain 
spread  out;  this  springs  from  the  fact  that  the  leaves  invariably  turn 
their  underneath  side  towards  the  ground. 

The  branches  are  proportionately  smaller  as  they  start  nearer  to  the 
birth  of  the  bough  which  produces  them.  g  28  r. 

[The  elder] 

Observe  on  the  lower  branch  of  the  elder  which  has  its  leaves  in 
twos  placing  them  crosswise  one  above  the  other,  if  the  stem  goes 
straight  up  towards  the  sky  this  order  never  fails,  and  its  larger  leaves 
occur  on  the  thicker  part  of  the  stem  and  the  smaller  on  the  thinner 
part  that  is  towards  the  top.  But  to  come  back  to  the  branch  below,  I 
maintain  that  the  leaves  which  are  placed  crosswise  to  those  on  the 
upper  branch,  being  constrained  by  the  law  which  causes  the  leaves  to 
turn  part  of  their  surface  towards  the  sky  in  order  to  catch  the  dew  at 
night,  must  necessarily  twist  round  when  so  placed  and  be  no  longer 
crosswise.  g  29  r. 


OF  THE  RAMIFICATIONS  OF  TREES  WITH  THEIR  LEAVES 

Of  the  ramifications  of  trees  some  such  as  the  elm  are  wide  and  thin 
after  the  fashion  of  a  hand  open  foreshortened,  and  these  are  visible  in 
their  whole  mass.  Below  they  are  seen  in  their  upper  side,  and  those 
that  are  highest  are  seen  from  beneath;  those  of  the  centre  show  them- 
selves part  below  and  part  above,  and  the  part  above  is  at  the  end  of  the 


3o4  BOTANY 

ramification;  and  this  part  that  is  in  the  centre  is  more  foreshortened 
than  any  other  of  those  which  are  turned  with  their  points  towards 
you.  Of  these  parts  that  are  in  the  centre  of  the  height  of  the  tree  the 
longest  will  be  towards  the  extremities  of  these  trees;  and  these  make 
ramifications  like  the  leaves  of  the  common  willow  which  grows  upon 
the  banks  of  rivers. 

Other  ramifications  are  round,  such  as  those  of  the  trees  that  put 
forth  their  shoots  and  leaves  so  that  the  sixth  is  above  the  first.  Others 
are  thin  and  diaphanous  as  the  willow  and  such  like  trees.        g  30  v. 


OF  THE  BEGINNING  OF  THE  BRANCHES  IN  TREES 

The  beginning  of  the  ramifications  of  trees  upon  their  principal 
branches  is  the  same  as  the  beginning  of  the  leaves  upon  the  shoots  of 
the  same  year  as  the  leaves.  And  these  leaves  have  three  ways  of  pro- 
ceeding one  higher  than  the  other;  the  first  and  most  usual  is  that  the 
sixth  on  the  upper  side  always  is  born  above  the  sixth  on  the  under 
side;  the  second  is  that  the  two  thirds  above  are  over  the  two  thirds 
below;  and  the  third  way  is  that  the  third  above  is  over  the  third  below. 


WHY  FREQUENTLY  THE  VEINS  OF  WOOD  ARE 
NOT  STRAIGHT 

When  the  branches  which  follow  the  second  year  above  that  of  the 
previous  year  are  not  of  equal  thickness  above  the  preceding  branches 
but  are  one-sided,  the  strength  of  the  branch  below  is  bent  to  nourish 
that  which  is  higher  although  it  is  somewhat  on  one  side. 

But  if  such  ramifications  are  equal  in  their  growth,  the  veins  of  their 
branch  will  be  straight,  and  at  an  equal  distance  at  every  stage  of  the 
height  of  the  plant. 

Do  you  therefore  O  painter  who  are  not  acquainted  with  these  laws, 
if  you  would  escape  the  censure  of  those  who  have  studied  them,  be 
zealous  to  represent  everything  according  to  nature  and  not  to  dis- 
parage such  study,  as  do  those  who  work  only  for  gain.  g  33  r. 

Every  branch  and  every  fruit  comes  above  the  insertion  of  its  leaf, 
which  serves  it  as  a  mother  by  bringing  it  the  water  of  the  rains  and  the 


BOTANY  505 

moisture  of  the  dew  th.it  tails  there  at  night  from  above,  and  often 

takes  from  them  the  exeessive  heat  of  the  sun's  rays.  a  J3  v. 

There  is  no  protuberance  on  a  branch  except  where  there  has  been 
some  branch  which  has  failed. 

The  lower  shoots  of  the  branches  of  trees  increase  more  than  the 
upper  shoots,  and  this  simply  arises  from  the  fact  that  the  sap  which 
feeds  them  having  gravity  moves  downwards  more  readily  than  up- 
wards. And  also  because  those  which  grow  downwards  separate  them- 
selves from  the  shade  which  there  is  in  the  centre  of  the  tree. 

The  older  the  branches  the  greater  the  difference  will  be  between 
their  upper  and  lower  shoots  and  between  those  of  the  same  year  or 
period.  c  34  v. 

OF  THE  CICATRICES  OF  TREES 

The  cicatrices  of  trees  grow  in  thickness  more  than  the  sap  that 
flows  through  them  and  nourishes  them  requires.  c  35  r. 

The  lower  branches  after  they  have  formed  the  angle  of  their  separa- 
tion from  their  trunk  always  bend  down,  so  as  not  to  press  against 
the  other  branches  which  follow  above  them  on  the  same  trunk  and  to 
be  better  able  to  take  the  air  which  nourishes  them.  c  35  v. 

The  elm  always  puts  greater  length  into  the  latest  branches  of  the 
year's  growth  than  it  does  into  those  of  the  same  year  which  are  lower. 
Nature  does  this  because  the  higher  branches  are  those  which  are  to 
increase  the  size  of  the  tree;  while  those  below  tend  to  dry  up  because 
they  remain  in  the  shadow,  and  their  growth  would  be  a  check  to  the 
entry  of  the  solar  rays  and  the  air  among  the  chief  branches  of  the  tree. 

The  chief  of  the  lower  branches  bend  down  more  than  the  upper 
ones  both  in  order  to  be  more  slanting  than  the  upper  ones  and  also 
because  they  are  larger  and  older;  and  in  order  to  seek  the  air  and 
escape  from  the  shade.  g  36  r. 

[Branch  structure  and  the  sun] 

Universally  almost  all  the  upright  parts  of  trees  are  found  to  bend 
somewhat  turning  their  convex  part  towards  the  south.  And  the 
branches  are  longer  thicker  and  more  numerous  towards  the  south 


306  BOTANY 

than  towards  the  north.  This  arises  from  the  fact  that  the  sun  draws 
the  sap  towards  that  part  of  the  surface  of  the  tree  which  is  near- 
est to  it.  This  is  evident  in  the  trees  which  are  frequently  pollarded, 
for  they  renew  their  growth  every  three  years.  And  one  notices  this 
unless  the  sun  is  screened  off  by  other  trees.  g  36  v. 

All  the  flowers  which  see  the  sun  mature  their  seed,  and  not  the

The  cherry  is  of  the  same  nature  as  the  fir  in  that  its  ramification  is 
made  in  steps  round  its  stem;  and  its  branches  grow  in  fours  fives  or

'When  nature  is  on  the  point  of  creating  stones  it 
produces  a  kjnd  of  sticky  paste,  which,  as  it  dries, 
forms  itself  into  a  solid  mass  together  with  what- 
ever it  has  enclosed  there,  which,  however,  it  does 
not  change  into  stone  but  preserves  within  it- 
self in  the  form  in  which  it  has  found  them!

The  streams  of  rivers  move  different  kinds  of  matter  which  are  of 
varying  degrees  of  gravity,  and  they  are  moved  farther  from  their 
position  in  proportion  as  they  are  lighter,  and  will  remain  nearer  to 
the  bottom  in  proportion  as  they  are  heavier,  and  will  be  carried  a 
greater  distance  when  driven  by  water  of  greater  power. 

But  when  this  power  ceases  to  be  capable  of  subduing  the  resistance 
of  the  gravel  this  gravel  becomes  firm  and  checks  the  direct  movement 
of  the  water  which  led  it  to  this  place.  Then  the  water,  as  it  strikes  on 
the  gravel  which  has  been  increased  in  this  manner,  leaps  back  cross- 
wise and  strikes  upon  other  spots  to  which  it  was  unaccustomed,  and 
takes  away  other  deposits  of  soil  down  to  their  foundations.  And  so  the 
places  where  first  the  said  river  used  to  pass  are  deserted  and  become 
silted  up  anew  by  a  fresh  deposit  from  the  turbid  waters,  and  these  in 
due  course  become  choked  up  in  these  same  places.  c.a.  77  v.  b

which  have  been  worn  away  by  the  continuous  currents  <>!  the  rivers 
rushing  precipitously  at  their  Eeel  with  their  swift  waters,  have  closed 

up  the  mouths  of  the  great  valleys  situated  in  the  high  places. 

These  are  the  causes  why  the  surface  of  the  water  is  raised  by  the 
creation  of  lakes,  and  why  new  streams  and  rivers  are  formed  in  high 
places.  C-A-  84  r-  a 

The  ebb  and  flow  of  the  sea  is  continually  moving  the  earth  with  all 
its  elements  away  from  the  centre  of  the  elements.  This  is  proved  by 
the  first  [chapter]  of  this  [treatise],  which  states  that  the  centre  of  the 
world  takes  count  of  that  which  is  higher  than  it  because  no  hollow 
lies  deeper  than  it.  The  centre  of  the  world  is  in  itself  immovable,  but 
the  place  in  which  it  is  found  is  in  continual  movement  towards  differ- 
ent aspects.  The  centre  of  the  world  changes  its  position  continually, 
and  of  these  changes  some  have  a  slower  movement  than  the  others,  for 
some  changes  occur  every  six  hours  and  some  take  many  thousand 
years. 

But  that  of  six  hours  proceeds  from  the  ebb  and  flow  of  the  sea,  the 
other  comes  from  the  wearing  away  of  the  mountains  through  the 
movements  of  the  water  produced  by  the  rains  and  the  continual 
course  of  the  rivers.  The  site  changes  in  its  relation  to  the  centre  of  the 
world  and  not  the  centre  to  the  site,  because  this  centre  is  immovable 
and  its  site  is  continually  moving  in  a  rectilinear  movement,  and  such 
movement  will  never  be  curvilinear.  c.a.  102  r.  b 

The  rains  wear  away  more  of  the  roots  of  the  mountains  than  they 
do  the  summits  for  two  reasons;  and  the  first  is  that  the  percussion  of 
the  rain  in  falling  from  the  same  height  is  more  powerful  on  the  bases 
of  the  mountains  than  on  their  summits  by  my  seventh  [rule],  which 
says  that  a  heavy  thing  becomes  so  much  swifter  as  it  descends  farther 
in  the  air,  and  as  it  becomes  swifter  so  it  becomes  heavier.  As  therefore 
there  is  more  space  between  the  roots  of  the  mountains  and  the  cloud 
than  between  these  clouds  and  the  summit  of  the  mountain,  the  rain, 
as  has  been  said,  is  heavier  and  more  powerful  upon  these  roots  of  the 
mountains  than  on  the  summit  of  the  same  mountain,  and  so  stage  by 
stage  its  power  to  wear  away  is  less  as  it  has  a  less  fall. 

The  second  reason  is  that  the  greater  mass  of  water  is  that  which 
descends  from  the  centre  of  the  mountain  to  its  roots  rather  than  from 


3io  GEOLOGY 

the  summit  of  this  mountain  to  the  said  centre;  and  so  we  have  dis- 
charged our  purpose. 

Valleys  grow  wider  with  the  progress  of  time:  their  depth  under- 
goes but  little  increase;  because  the  rains  bring  as  much  soil  to  the 
valley  almost  as  the  river  washes  away,  and  in  some  pares  more  in 
others  less. 

Very  great  rivers  flow  underground. 

The  rivers  make  greater  deposits  of  soil  when  near  to  populated 
districts  than  they  do  where  there  are  no  inhabitants.  Because  in  such 
places  the  mountains  and  hills  are  being  worked  upon,  and  the  rains 
wash  away  the  soil  that  has  been  turned  up  more  easily  than  the  hard 
ground  which  is  covered  with  weeds. 

The  heights  of  mountains  are  more  eternal  and  more  enduring  when 
they  are  covered  with  snow  during  the  whole  winter.       c.a.  160  v.  a 

In  between  water  and  stone  in  equal  quantities  are  an  almost  infinite 
number  of  different  grades  of  weight,  that  is  there  are  as  many  varie- 
ties of  the  weights  as  there  are  of  the  thicknesses;  so  there  will  be  pure 
water,  then  water  with  a  very  small  quantity  of  earth  in  it,  and  then 
this  is  increased  little  by  little  until  it  forms  mud,  and  then  this  mud 
becomes  more  solid,  and  at  last  it  becomes  solid  earth,  and  then  goes  on 
to  become  like  the  hardest  stone  and  is  even  transformed  into  the 
metals. 

And  this  I  say  because  I  have  to  take  away  like  things  in  order  to 
press  the  water  out  of  its  vessels. 

Of  the  rising  of  the  water  to  the  mountains,  which  acts  like  water

animals  so  water  does  in  the  world,  which  is  a  living  body.

strata  be  created? 

The  mud  or  sand  from  which  the  water  drains  off  when  they  are  left 


GEOLOGY  311 

uncovered  after  the  floods  of  the  rivers  supplies  an  answer   to  this 
question. 

The  water  which  drained  away  from  the  land  which  the  sea  left,  at 
the  time  when  this  earth  raised  itself  up  some  distance  above  the  sea, 
still  remaining  almost  flat,  commenced  to  make  various  channels 
through  the  lower  parts  of  this  plain,  and  beginning  thus  to  hollow  it 
out  they  would  make  a  bed  for  the  other  waters  round  about;  and  in 
this  way  throughout  the  whole  of  their  course  they  gained  breadth  and 
depth,  their  waters  constantly  increasing  until  all  this  water  was 
drained  away  and  these  hollows  became  then  the  beds  of  torrents  which 
take  the  floods  of  the  rains.  And  so  they  will  go  on  wearing  away  the 
sides  of  these  rivers  until  the  intervening  banks  become  precipitous 
crags;  and  after  the  water  has  thus  been  drained  away  these  hills  com- 
mence to  dry  and  to  form  stone  in  layers  more  or  less  thick  according 
to  the  depth  of  the  mud  which  the  rivers  deposited  in  the  sea  in  their 
floods.  f  n  v. 

Of  creatures  which  have  their  bones  on  the  outside,  like  cockles, 
snails,  oysters,  scallops,  'bouoli'  and  the  like,  which  are  of  innumer- 
able kinds: 

When  the  floods  of  the  rivers  which  were  turbid  with  fine  mud 
deposited  this  upon  the  creatures  which  dwelt  beneath  the  waters  near 
the  ocean  borders,  these  creatures  became  embedded  in  this  mud,  and 
finding  themselves  entirely  covered  under  a  great  weight  of  mud  they 
were  forced  to  perish  for  lack  of  a  supply  of  the  creatures  on  which 
they  were  accustomed  to  feed. 

In  course  of  time  the  level  of  the  sea  became  lower,  and  as  the  salt 
water  flowed  away  this  mud  became  changed  into  stone;  and  such  of 
these  shells  as  had  lost  their  inhabitants  became  filled  up  in  their  stead 
with  mud;  and  consequently  during  the  process  of  change  of  all  the 
surrounding  mud  into  stone,  this  mud  also  which  was  within  the 
frames  of  the  half-opened  shells,  since  by  the  opening  of  the  shell  it 
was  joined  to  the  rest  of  the  mud,  became  also  itself  changed  into 
stone;  and  therefore  all  the  frames  of  these  shells  were  left  between 
two  petrified  substances,  namely  that  which  surrounded  them  and  that 
which  they  enclosed. 

These  are  still  to  be  found  in  many  places,  and  almost  all  the  petri-

fied  shellfish  in  the  rocks  of  the  mountains  still  have  their  natural 
frame  round  them,  and  especially  those  which  were  of  a  sufficient  age 
to  be  preserved  by  reason  of  their  hardness,  while  the  younger  ones 
which  were  already  in  great  part  changed  into  chalk  were  penetrated 
by  the  viscous  and  petrifying  moisture.  f  79  r. 

OF  THE  BONES  OF  FISHES  FOUND  IN  THOSE  THAT 
HAVE  BEEN  PETRIFIED 

All  the  creatures  that  have  their  bones  within  their  skin,  on  being 
covered  over  by  the  mud  from  the  inundations  of  rivers  which  have 
left  their  accustomed  beds,  are  at  once  enclosed  in  a  mould  by  this  mud. 
And  so  in  course  of  time  as  the  channels  of  the  rivers  become  lower 
these  creatures  being  embedded  and  shut  in  within  the  mud,  and  the 
flesh  and  organs  being  worn  away  and  only  the  bones  remaining,  and 
even  these  having  lost  their  natural  order  of  arrangement,  they  have 
fallen  down  into  the  base  of  the  mould  which  has  been  formed  by  their 
impress;  and  as  the  mud  becomes  lifted  above  the  level  of  the  stream, 
the  mud  runs  away  so  that  it  dries  and  becomes  first  a  sticky  paste  and 
then  changes  into  stone,  enclosing  whatsoever  it  finds  within  itself  and 
itself  filling  up  every  cavity;  and  finding  the  hollow  part  of  the  mould 
formed  by  these  creatures  it  percolates  gradually  through  the  tiny 
crevices  in  the  earth  through  which  the  air  that  is  within  escapes  away 
— that  is  laterally,  for  it  cannot  escape  upwards  since  there  the  crevices 
are  filled  up  by  the  moisture  descending  into  the  cavity,  nor  can  it 
escape  downwards  because  the  moisture  which  has  already  fallen  has 
closed  up  the  crevices.  There  remain  the  openings  at  the  side,  whence 
this  air,  condensed  and  pressed  down  upon  by  the  moisture  which 
descends,  escapes  with  the  same  slow  rate  of  progress  as  that  of  the 
moisture  which  descends  there;  and  this  paste  as  it  dries  becomes 
stone,  which  is  devoid  of  weight,  and  preserves  the  exact  shapes  of  the 
creatures  which  have  there  made  the  mould,  and  encloses  their  bones 
within  it.  f  79  v. 

SHELLS  AND  THE  REASON  OF  THEIR  SHAPE 

The  creature  that  resides  within  the  shell  constructs  its  dwelling  with 
joints  and  seams  and  roofing  and  the  other  various  parts,  just  as  man 


C.KOLOGY  J13 

does  in  the  house  in  which  he  dwells;  and  this  creature  expands  1  he- 
house  and  root  gradually  in  proportion  as  its  body  increases  and  as  it 
is  attached  to  the  sides  of  these  shells. 

Consequently  the  brightness  and  smoothness  which  these  shells  pos- 
sess on  the  inner  side  is  somewhat  dulled  at  the  point  where  they  arc- 
attached  to  the  creature  that  dwells  there,  and  the  hollow  of  it  is 
roughened,  ready  to  receive  the  knitting  together  of  the  muscles  by 
means  of  which  the  creature  draws  itself  in  when  it  wishes  to  shut  itself 
up  within  its  house. 

When  nature  is  on  the  point  of  creating  stones  it  produces  a  kind  of 
sticky  paste,  which  as  it  dries,  forms  itself  into  a  solid  mass  together 
with  whatever  it  has  enclosed  there,  which,  however,  it  does  not  change 
into  stone  but  preserves  within  itself  in  the  form  in  which  it  has  found 
them.  This  is  why  leaves  are  found  whole  within  the  rocks  which  are 
formed  at  the  bases  of  the  mountains,  together  with  a  mixture  of  dif- 
ferent kinds  of  things,  just  as  they  have  been  left  there  by  the  floods 
from  the  rivers  which  have  occurred  in  the  autumn  seasons;  and  there 
the  mud  caused  by  the  successive  inundations  has  covered  them  over, 
and  then  this  mud  grows  into  one  mass  together  with  the  aforesaid 
paste,  and  becomes  changed  into  successive  layers  of  stone  which  cor- 
respond with  the  layers  of  the  mud.  f.  80  r. 

OF  SHELLS  IN  MOUNTAINS 

And  if  you  wish  to  say  that  the  shells  are  produced  by  nature  in 
these  mountains  by  means  of  the  influence  of  the  stars,  in  what  way 
will  you  show  that  this  influence  produces  in  the  very  same  place  shells 
of  various  sizes  and  varying  in  age,  and  of  different  kinds? 

SHINGLE 

And  how  will  you  explain  to  me  the  fact  of  the  shingle  being  all 
stuck  together  and  lying  in  layers  at  different  altitudes  upon  the  high 
mountains?  For  there  there  is  to  be  found  shingle  from  divers  parts 
carried  from  various  countries  to  the  same  spot  by  the  rivers  in  their 
course;  and  this  shingle  is  nothing  but  pieces  of  stone  which  have  lost 
their  sharp  edges  from  having  been  rolled  over  and  over  for  a  long

time,  and  from  the  various  blows  and  falls  which  they  have  met  with 
during  the  passage  of  the  waters  which  have  brought  them  to  this  spot. 

LEAVES 

And  how  will  you  account  for  the  very  great  number  of  different 
kinds  of  leaves  embedded  in  the  high  rocks  of  these  mountains,  and  for 
the  aliga,  the  seaweed,  which  is  found  lying  intermingled  with  the 
shells  and  the  sand  ? 

And  in  the  same  way  you  will  see  all  kinds  of  petrified  things  to- 
gether with  ocean  crabs,  broken  in  pieces  and  separated  and  mixed  with 
their  shells.  f  80  v.

The  wave  travels  beneath  the  surface1  of  the  sea,  and  leaves  behind 
itself  all  the  foam  which  is  produced  in  front  of  it. 

The  space  of  the  surface  of  the  water  that  intervenes  between  the 
waves  as  they  come  to  the  shore  is  polished  and  smooth;  and  this  comes 
about  because  the  greatest  wave  is  swifter  than  the  lesser  waves  of 
which  it  is  made  up  [in  the  universal  surface  of  the  sea;  and  this 
greatest  wave  draws  back  the  surface  of  the  sea,  and  the  first  foam  of 
the  wave  descends  as  it  opens  at  the  spot  where  the  remainder  is 
fleeing  away. 

And  the  figure  of  the  foam  which  then  remains  behind  in  the  wave

mountains,  the  bones  of  the  earth,  with  their  wide  bases,  penetrated 
and  towered  up  amid  the  air,  covered  over  and  clad  with  much  high- 
lying  soil.  Subsequently  the  incessant  rains  have  caused  the  rivers  to 
increase  and  by  repeated  washing  have  stripped  bare  part  of  the  lofty 
summits  of  these  mountains,  leaving  the  site  of  the  earth,  so  that  the 
rock  finds  itself  exposed  to  the  air,  and  the  earth  has  departed  from 
these  places.  And  the  earth  from  off  the  slopes  and  the  lofty  summits 
of  the  mountains  has  already  descended  to  their  bases,  and  has  raised 
the  floors  of  the  seas  which  encircle  these  bases,  and  caused  the  plain

DOUBT 

Here  a  doubt  arises,  and  that  is  as  to  whether  the  Flood  which  came 
in  the  time  of  Noah  was  universal  or  not,  and  this  would  seem  not  to 
have  been  the  case  for  the  reasons  which  will  now  be  given.  We  have  it 
in  the  Bible  that  the  said  Flood  was  caused  by  forty  days  and  forty 
nights  of  continuous  and  universal  rain,  and  that  this  rain  rose  ten 
cubits  above  the  highest  mountain  in  the  world.  But  consequently  if  it 
had  been  the  case  that  the  rain  was  universal  it  would  have  formed  in 
itself  a  covering  around  our  globe  which  is  spherical  in  shape;  and  a 
sphere  has  every  part  of  its  circumference  equally  distant  from  its 
centre,  and  therefore  on  the  sphere  of  water  finding  itself  in  the  afore- 
said condition,  it  becomes  impossible  for  the  water  on  its  surface  to 
move,  since  water  does  not  move  of  its  own  accord  unless  to  descend. 
How  then  did  the  waters  of  so  great  a  Flood  depart  if  it  is  proved  that 
they  had  no  power  of  motion?  If  it  departed,  how  did  it  move,  unless 
it  went  upwards?  At  this  point  natural  causes  fail  us,  and  therefore  in 
order  to  resolve  such  a  doubt  we  must  needs  either  call  in  a  miracle  to 
our  aid  or  else  say  that  all  this  water  was  evaporated  by  the  heat  of

Three  is  the  number  of  the  winds  which  bend  the  rivers  to  the  west 
as  they  discharge  themselves  into  the  Mediterranean  Sea  on  the  shores 
that  face  south.  This  is  proved  as  follows:  the  sand  that  is  driven  by 
the  winds  into  the  water  is  no  longer  subject  to  the  winds,  through 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  317 

being  weighed  down  by  the  water  which  covers  it  over  and  forms  a 
screen  tor  it  against  these  winds. 

Therefore  the  river  /;  m  which  ilows  into  the  sea  will  half  way  in  its 
course  make  a  beginning  of  a  movement  to  the  west,  when  it  feels  the 
breath  of  the  winds  known  as  Greco,  Levante  and  Scirocco,  which  at 
various  times  set  the  dry  sand  of  the  shore  spinning,  and  hurl  it  into 
the  sea,  where  it  becomes  submerged  and  settles  upon  the  bed  of  the 
sea.  But  the  north  wind  called  Greco  throws  it  to  the  south-west,  and 
the  Scirocco  throws  it  to  the  north-west.  But  the  southern  waves  strik- 
ing on  the  shore  throw  this  sand  back  towards  the  river,  and  the  river 
strikes  it  back  towards  the  sea;  and  when  the  waves  struck  back  from 
the  shore  come  to  an  encounter  with  the  waves  advancing  to  the  shore 
the  movement  of  these  waves  then  ceases  because  the  power  of  their 
movement  is  lacking.  Therefore  the  sand  having  made  the  water  turbid 
descends  to  the  bottom,  and  it  is  this  same  sand  which  forms  itself  into 
a  bank  and  bends  in  a  westerly  direction  the  aforesaid  river.  Why  does 
it  not  bend  the  course  of  the  river  to  the  east  as  well  as  to  the  west? 
Because  the  sea  has  been  proved  to  run  to  the  west  and  not  to  the  east. 

Let  us  therefore  make  a  bridge  as  wide  and  low  as  the  shore  out  of 
large  planks.  c.a.  167  v.  a 

The  water  wears  away  the  mountains  and  fills  up  the  valleys,  and  if 
it  had  the  power  it  would  reduce  the  earth  to  a  perfect  sphere.

INSTANCES  AND  DEDUCTIONS  AS  TO  THE 
EARTH'S  INCREASE 

Take  a  vase,  fill  it  full  of  pure  earth,  and  set  it  up  on  a  roof.  You  will 
see  how  immediately  the  green  herbs  will  begin  to  shoot  up,  and  how 
these,  when  fully  grown,  will  cast  their  various  seeds;  and  after  the 
children  have  thus  fallen  at  the  feet  of  their  parents,  you  will  see  the 
herbs  having  cast  their  seeds,  becoming  withered  and  falling  back  again 
to  the  earth,  and  writhin  a  short  time  becoming  changed  into  the  earth's 
substance  and  giving  it  increase;  after  this  you  will  see  the  seeds  spring- 
ing up  and  passing  through  the  same  course,  and  so  you  wall  always  see 
the  successive  generations  after  completing  their  natural  course,  by  their 
death  and  corruption  giving  increase  to  the  earth.  And  if  you  let  ten 


318  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

years  elapse  and  then  measure  the  increase  in  the  soil,  you  will  be  able 
to  discover  how  much  the  earth  in  general  has  increased,  and  then  by 
multiplying  you  will  see  how  great  has  been  the  increase  of  the  earth  in 
the  world  during  a  thousand  years.  Some  may  say  that  this  instance  of 
the  vase  which  I  have  mentioned  does  not  justify  the  deduction  based 
upon  it,  because  one  sees  in  the  case  of  these  vases  that  for  the  prize  of 
the  flowers  that  are  looked  for  a  part  of  the  soil  is  frequently  taken 
away,  and  its  place  is  filled  up  with  new  rich  soil;  and  I  reply  to  them 
that  as  the  soil  which  is  added  there  is  a  blend  of  rich  fat  substances 
and  broken  bits  of  all  sorts  of  things  it  cannot  be  said  to  be  pure  earth, 
and  this  mass  of  substances  decaying  and  so  losing  in  part  their  shape 
becomes  changed  into  a  rich  ooze,  which  feeds  the  roots  of  the  plants 
above  them;  and  this  is  the  reason  why  it  may  appear  to  you  that  the 
earth  is  lessened;  but  if  you  allow  the  plants  that  grow  in  it  to  die,  and 
their  seeds  to  spring  up,  then  in  time  you  will  behold  its  increase. 

For  do  you  not  perceive  how,  among  the  high  mountains,  the  walls 
of  ancient  and  ruined  cities  are  being  covered  over  and  concealed  by 
the  earth's  increase? 

Nay,  have  you  not  seen  how  on  the  rocky  summits  of  the  mountains 
the  live  stone  itself  has  in  course  of  time  swallowed  up  by  its  growth 
some  column  which  it  supported,  and  stripping  it  bare  as  with  shears 
and  grasping  it  tightly,  has  left  the  impress  of  its  fluted  form  in  the 
living  rock?  c.a.  265  r.  a 

When  mountains  fall  headlong  over  hollow  places  they  shut  in  the 
air  within  their  caverns,  and  this  air,  in  order  to  escape,  breaks  through 
the  earth,  and  so  produces  earthquakes. 

My  opponent  says  this  cannot  be  the  case,  for  either  the  whole 
mountain  which  covers  the  cavern  falls  or  else  only  the  inner  part  of  it; 
and  if  the  whole  falls,  then  the  compressed  air  escapes  through  the 
opening  of  the  cave  which  is  uncovered,  while  if  only  the  inner  part 
falls  then  the  compressed  air  escapes  into  the  vacuum  which  is  left  by 
the  falling  earth.  c.a.  289  v.  b 

Similarly  the  movements  of  the  waters  running  through  all  the  pas- 
sages of  the  sterile  earth  are  its  life-giving  force.  And  just  as  the  mois- 
ture spread  through  the  vine  rises  up  and  pours  through  the  severed 
members,  (the  utmost  heights  of  the  mountains  through  the  severed 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  319 

veins),  so  it  is  with  the  water  which  rises  to  a  height  and  pours  through 
the  chasms  in  the  topmost  heights  of  the  mountains. 

In  the  same  way  the  waters  from  the  base  rise  to  a  height,  pouring 
through  the  chasms  in  the  topmost  heights  of  the  highest  mountains. 

And  as  the  moisture  which  pours  through  the  severed  vine  desires 
only  the  centre  of  the  earth  and  moves  towards  it,  so  the  waters  pour- 
ing from  the  heights  of  the  mountains  move  of  their  own  free  will 
towards  this  centre. 

And  as  the  water  from  the  severed  vine  falling  down  upon  its  roots 
and  penetrating  into  these  raises  itself  up  to  a  height  and  pours  itself 
out  again  at  the  very  place  where  the  cutting  was,  so  the  water  falling 
from  the  summits  of  the  mountains  and  penetrating  through  the  pas- 
sages of  the  earth  returns  upwards.  c.a.  309  v.  a 

The  surface  of  the  Red  Sea  is  on  a  level  with  the  Ocean. 

This  made  the  Mediterranean  light  both  in  the  bed  which  is  lowered 
and  in  the  surface  where  formerly  was  the  water. 

Lacking  the  weight  of  the  waters  of  the  Mediterranean  which  had 
been  diminished  the  earth  rose  and  changed  in  itself  its  centre  of 
gravity. 

The  waters  of  the  sea  which  descend  into  the  Ocean  from  the  Medi- 
terranean Sea  have  through  the  force  of  their  impact  on  the  bottom 
hollowed  out  this  bed  considerably  beneath  the  surface  of  this  Ocean; 
and  in  their  fall  this  hollowing  out  has  withdrawn  itself  to  the  point  at 
which  it  arrives  at  the  end  of  the  channel  of  Gades,  and  there  it  is 
visible  to-day. 

A  mountain  may  have  fallen  and  blocked  the  mouth  of  the  Red  Sea 
and  prevented  the  outlet  to  the  Mediterranean,  and  thus  swirling  in  a 
flood  this  sea  will  have  as  its  outlet  the  passage  between  the  mountains 
of  Gades,  for  in  the  same  way  we  have  seen  in  our  time  a  mountain 
fall  seven  miles  and  block  up  a  valley  and  make  a  lake;  and  thus  the 
greater  number  of  the  lakes  were  made  by  mountains,  as  the  lake  of 
Garda,  of  Como  and  Lugano  and  Lake  Maggiore.  .  .  . 

All  the  plains  which  lie  between  the  seas  and  the  mountains  were 
once  covered  by  the  salt  waters. 

Every  valley  has  been  made  by  its  river,  and  the  proportion  between 
valleys  is  the  same  as  that  between  rivers. 


320  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

The  greatest  river  in  the  world  is  the  Mediterranean  which  is  a  river 
that  moves  from  the  source  of  the  Nile  to  the  Western  Ocean. 

c.a.  328  v.  b 

The  water  given  to  the  Mediterranean  by  rain  and  rivers  is  restored 
to  the  Ocean  through  the  straits  of  Gades  [Gibraltar],  with  so  much 
less  water  in  proportion  as  the  springs  are  beneficent  to  it  and  the  sea 
evaporates  it. 

And  this  excess  is  the  cause  of  the  ebb  and  flow,  because  in  the  flow 
the  Mediterranean  is  swollen  up  by  the  Ocean  and  this  turns  back  and 
ebbs  away  through  the  Mediterranean  which  discharges  it.

Just  as  the  snow  as  it  falls  in  flakes  upon  various  rounded  objects 
covers  them  with  itself  but  with  as  many  varying  degrees  of  thickness 
as  there  are  variations  in  the  curves  of  this  roundness,  so  the  earth, 
borne  by  the  floods  of  the  rivers  after  the  mass  of  the  waters,  descends 
upon  the  various  rounded  objects  which  are  at  the  bottom  of  the  waters 
and  covers  these  with  itself  in  the  manner  shown  above,    c.a.  383  v. 

OF  THE  CENTRE  OF  THE  OCEAN 

The  centre  of  the  sphere  of  water  is  the  true  centre  of  the  orb  of  our 
world  which  is  compounded  of  land  and  water  in  the  shape  of  a  sphere. 
But  if  you  wish  to  find  the  centre  of  the  element  of  the  earth  this  is 
situated  at  a  point  equidistant  from  the  surface  of  the  ocean  and  not 
equidistant  from  the  surface  of  the  earth.  For  it  is  easy  to  understand 
that  this  globe  of  the  earth  has  no  perfect  roundness  whatever  except  in 
those  parts  in  which  are  the  sea  or  lakes  or  other  surfaces  of  still  water; 
and  every  part  of  the  land  which  rises  above  the  water  is  farther 
removed  from  the  centre.  a  58  v. 

OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  AIR  AND  WATER 

This  air  which  bounds  and  continually  moves  upon  this  terrestrial 
machine  is  mixed  with  moisture  similar  to  that  with  which  the  earth  is 
compounded,  and  the  excess  of  this  moisture  falls  back  continually 
upon  the  earth  once  in  twenty-four  hours  and  then  springs  back  raised 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  321 

■j  little  by  the  heat  of  the  sun  and  sustained  by  it  so  long  as  it  remains 
in  our  hemisphere.  Then  being  left  abandoned  by  it  at  its  departure 
and  still  having  weight  it  falls  back  on  the  earth. 

In  summer  this  moisture  is  called  dew  and  in  winter  as  the  cold 
condenses  it  and  freezes  it  it  is  called  hoar  frost.  c  6  r. 


OF  HOW  THE  SEA  CHANGES  THE  WEIGHT  OF 
THE  EARTH 

The  shells  of  oysters  and  other  similar  creatures  which  are  born  in 
the  mud  of  the  sea  testify  to  us  of  the  change  in  the  earth  round  the 
centre  of  our  elements.  This  is  proved  as  follows: — the  mighty  rivers 
always  flow  turbid  because  of  the  earth  stirred  up  in  them  through  the 
friction  of  their  waters  upon  their  bed  and  against  the  banks;  and  this 
process  of  destruction  uncovers  the  tops  of  the  ridges  formed  by  the 
layers  of  these  shells,  which  are  embedded  in  the  mud  of  the  sea  where 
they  were  born  when  the  salt  waters  covered  them.  And  these  same 
ridges  were  from  time  to  time  covered  over  by  varying  thicknesses  of 
mud  which  had  been  brought  down  to  the  sea  by  the  rivers  in  floods 
of  varying  magnitude;  and  in  this  way  these  shells  remained  walled  up 
and  dead  beneath  this  mud,  which  became  raised  to  such  a  height  that 
the  bed  of  the  sea  emerged  into  the  air. 

And  now  these  beds  are  of  so  great  a  height  that  they  have  become 
hills  or  lofty  mountains,  and  the  rivers  which  wear  away  the  sides  of 
these  mountains  lay  bare  the  strata  of  the  shells,  and  so  the  light  surface 
of  the  earth  is  continually  raised,  and  the  antipodes  draw  nearer  to  the 
centre  of  the  earth,  and  the  ancient  beds  of  the  sea  become  chains  of 
mountains.  e  4  v. 

The  destruction  of  marshes  will  be  brought  about  when  turbid  rivers 
flow  into  them. 

This  is  proved  by  the  fact  that  where  the  river  flows  swiftly  it  washes 
away  the  soil,  and  where  it  delays  there  it  leaves  its  deposit,  and  both 
for  this  reason  and  because  water  never  travels  so  slowly  in  rivers  as  it 
does  in  the  marshes  of  the  valleys  the  movement  of  the  waters  there  is 
imperceptible.  But  in  these  marshes  the  river  has  to  enter  through  a 
long  narrow  winding  channel,  and  it  has  to  flow  out  over  a  large  area 


322  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

of  but  little  depth;  and  this  is  necessary  because  the  water  flowing  in 
the  river  is  thicker  and  more  laden  with  earth  in  the  lower  than  in  the 
upper  part;  and  the  sluggish  water  of  the  marshes  also  is  the  same, 
but  the  variation  between  the  lightness  and  heaviness  of  the  upper  and 
lower  waters  of  the  marshes  far  exceeds  that  in  the  currents  of  the 
rivers,  in  which  the  lightness  of  the  upper  part  differs  but  little  from 
the  heaviness  of  the  part  below. 

So  the  conclusion  is  that  the  marsh  will  be  destroyed  because  it  is 
receiving  turbid  water  below,  while  above,  on  the  opposite  side  of  the 
same  marsh,  only  clear  water  is  flowing  out;  and  consequently  the  bed 
of  the  marsh  will  of  necessity  be  raised  by  means  of  the  soil  which  is 
being  continually  discharged  into  it.  e  5  r. 

How  by  running  waters  one  should  conduct  the  soil  of  the  mountains 
into  marshy  valleys  and  so  render  them  fertile  and  purify  the  sur- 
rounding air: 

The  ramifications  of  the  canals  which  are  led  from  the  high  hills 
according  to  their  natural  course  are  those  which  in  their  changes  carry 
the  soil  from  these  hills  to  the  low  marshes,  filling  them  up  with  earth 
and  rendering  them  fertile. 

Let  a  be  the  main  stream  which  enters  the  marshes  at  b  f  s;  let  the 
canal  start  from  the  height  of  the  hills  a  c  n,  from  which  suppose  vari- 
ous branches  to  have  fallen,  changing  it  where  it  is  all  united  into 
different  places,  and  thus  their  fury  tears  away  the  soil  and  after  they 
have  run  their  course  they  deposit  it  in  the  low  swamps;  and  thus  you 
will  be  able  to  change  so  much  the  fall  of  the  whole  canal,  abounding 
as  it  does  in  water,  that  you  will  have  levelled  the  soil  left  uncovered 
from  these  marshes.  f  14  r. 

Why  pools  are  formed  near  the  sea,  and  why  their  great  floods  are 
poured  into  the  sea  through  so  narrow  a  channel,  upon  the  sides  of 
which  between  the  pool  and  the  sea  so  great  a  bank  is  formed: 

The  storms  of  the  sea  cast  up  on  to  the  shore  a  great  quantity  of  sand, 
and  this  is  heaped  up  all  along  the  shore  both  at  the  mouth  of  the  pool 
and  elsewhere;  and  as  the  storm  ceases  the  mouth  of  the  pool  remains 
closed  by  the  aforesaid  matter  thrown  up  by  the  sea.  And  as  the  water 
that  the  pool  receives  from  the  neighbouring  rivers  cannot  find  any 
other  exit  it  proceeds  to  rise  and  acquire  weight  and  power;  and  there- 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  323 

fore  it  either  bursts  through  the  bank  interposed  between  it  and  the  sea 
or  flows  over  it  and  with  its  outpouring  wears  away  as  much  of  the 
bank  as  it  touches,  pursuing  its  course  until  it  has  cleared  out  of  its 
path  all  the  matter  that  impeded  its  necessary  dispersion. 

Moreover  it  only  consumes  what  is  necessary;  at  first  it  is  very  large 
because  the  water  that  flows  towards  where  the  mouth  should  be  is 
clear,  and  at  the  end  the  course  of  the  water  becomes  contracted,  be- 
cause it  has  become  thicker  as  it  acquires  depth;  and  this  is  the  reason 
why  such  outlet  from  the  pools  to  the  sea  is  always  narrow,      f  40  v. 


OF  THE  WAVES 

Sometimes  the  waves  are  swifter  than  the  wind,  and  sometimes  the 
wind  is  much  swifter  than  the  wave;  the  ships  prove  this  upon  the  sea. 
The  waves  can  be  swifter  than  the  wind  through  having  been  com- 
menced by  the  great  winds,  the  wind  then  having  ceased  and  the  wave 
having  still  preserved  a  great  impetus.  f  48  v. 

One  asks  whether  a  river  which  passes  through  a  lake  changes  the 
uniform  distance  at  which  the  surface  of  this  lake  was  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth  before  this  river  passed  through  the  said  lake. 

This  is  an  interesting  question;  and  one  shows  that  this  surface  dis- 
turbs the  uniformity  of  its  distance  from  the  centre  of  the  earth  in 
order  to  give  a  passage  to  the  said  river,  by  the  fourth  [rule],  which 
shows  that  water  does  not  move  unless  to  descend.  And  here  it  is  neces- 
sary to  understand  whether  the  exit  of  the  river  has  a  width  equal  to 
that  of  the  entrance  and  if  this  is  so  it  is  necessary  that  the  water  be  of 
uniform  course,  by  the  seventh  [rule],  which  shows  that  the  movement 
of  every  river  in  an  equal  time  gives  to  every  part  of  its  length  an  equal 
weight  of  water.  Now  if  the  river  emitted  water  which  required  a  drop 
of  a  braccio  in  a  mile,  the  width  of  the  exit  being  as  has  been  said  equal 
to  the  width  of  the  entrance,  it  would  be  necessary  that  all  the  river 
which  passes  through  the  lake  should  also  have  a  drop  of  one  braccio 
per  mile,  and  consequently  the  water  of  this  lake  would  have  its  surface 
at  a  varying  distance  from  the  centre  of  the  earth.  But  the  water  will 
have  this  course.  .  .  . 

That  part  of  the  water  of  the  lake  will  be  of  slowest  movement  which 


324  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

finds  itself  farthest  removed  from  the  shortest  line  from  the  entrance  to 
the  exit  of  the  river  which  passes  through  this  lake. 

Here  it  follows  that  the  Sea  of  Azov  which  borders  upon  the  Don  is 
the  highest  part  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea;  and  it  is  three  thousand  five 
hundred  miles  distant  from  the  straits  of  Gibraltar,  as  is  shown  by  the 
navigators'  chart;  and  it  has  a  descent  of  three  thousand  five  hundred 
braccia,  that  is  a  mile  and  a  sixth,  this  sea  consequently  being  higher 
than  any  mountain  that  there  is  in  the  west.  f  68  r.  and  v. 

OF  THE  WIND 

Since  the  eddies  of  the  winds  are  below  and  above  as  well  as  cross- 
wise the  countryfolk  cannot  tell  what  wind  it  is  that  is  blowing,  that  is 
those  who  dwell  under  the  hills  by  the  sea  shores  do  not  know  if  the 
wind  is  from  an  eddy  or  if  it  is  the  straight  wind. 

The  wind  that  strikes  upon  the  sea  coasts  or  borders  or  sides  of  the 
mountains  raises  itself  up  to  the  summit  where  it  presses  itself  against 
the  course  of  the  other  straight  wind,  and  then  it  spreads  itself  out 
moistening  the  opposite.  ...  i  130  [82]  v. 

Why  the  thunder  lasts  for  a  longer  time  than  that  which  causes  it;

WINDS  AND  THUNDERBOLTS 

The  winds  which  rise  from  the  cloud  continue  in  movement;  in  such 
a  way  that  the  more  they  move  the  farther  they  rise  in  the  lighter  air 
because  they  are  less  impeded  there.  And  if  they  meet  each  other  they 
leap  back,  and  it  is  in  these  encounters  that  thunderbolts  are  produced. 

If  the  wind  originates  at  a  low  altitude,  what  is  it  that  drives  it  more 
to  the  east  than  to  the  west ?  k   113   [33]   r. 

[Watery  sphere  and  centre  of  world] 

The  surface  of  the  watery  sphere  is  always  more  remote  from  the 
centre  of  the  world: 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  325 

This  comes  about  by  reason  of  the  soil  brought  by  the  inundations 

of  turbid  rivers.  These  deposit  the  soil  which  causes  their  turbidity  on 
the  shores  of  the  ocean  and  so  narrow  the  sea  beach;  beside  this  they 
raise  their  bed  and  so  of  necessity  the  surface  of  this  element  comes  to 
be  raised. 

The  centre  of  the  world  continually  changes  its  position  in  the  body 
of  the  earth  fleeing  towards  our  hemisphere. 

This  is  shown  by  the  above-mentioned  soil  which  is  continually  car- 
ried away  from  the  declivities  or  sides  of  the  mountains  and  borne  to 
the  seas;  the  more  it  is  carried  away  from  there  the  more  it  becomes 
lightened  and  as  a  consequence  the  more  it  becomes  heavy  where  this 
soil  is  deposited  by  the  ocean  waves,  wherefore  it  is  necessary  that  such 
centre  changes  its  position.  l  13  v. 

[Surface  of  the  earth  and  centre  of  gravity] 

That  part  of  the  surface  of  any  heavy  body  will  become  more  distant 
from  the  centre  of  its  gravity  which  becomes  of  greater  lightness.

slopes  of  the  mountains  and  bear  them  to  the  sea,  is  the  place  from 
which  such  gravity  is  removed;  it  will  make  itself  lighter  and  in  conse- 
quence will  make  itself  more  remote  from  the  centre  of  the  gravity  of 
the  earth,  that  is  from  the  centre  of  the  universe  which  is  always  con- 
centric with  the  centre  of  the  gravity  of  the  earth.  l   17  r. 

[Changes  in  mountains  and  valleys] 

The  summits  of  the  mountains  in  course  of  time  rise  continually. 

The  opposite  sides  of  the  mountains  always  approach  one  another. 

The  depths  of  the  valleys  which  are  above  the  watery  sphere  in 
course  of  time  constantly  draw  near  to  the  centre  of  the  world. 

During  the  same  period  of  time  the  valleys  sink  much  more  than 
the  mountains  rise. 

The  bases  of  the  mountains  are  always  drawing  closer  together. 

As  the  valley  grows  deeper  so  its  sides  become  worn  away  in  a  shorter 
space  of  time.  l  76  r.

[Water  upon  sand] 

Why  as  smooth  sand  is  formed  of  grains  uneven  in  shape  and  size 
the  water  which  flows  above  them  drives  these  grains  with  varying 
degrees  of  movement  ?  Just  as  the  bodies  that  vary  in  weight  and  shape 
make  different  movements  in  the  still  air  so  do  the  air  and  the  water  as 
they  move  among  still  bodies.  And  this  is  why  the  sand  loses  its  smooth- 
ness by  the  movement  of  the  water  that  passes  over  it.  And  the  moved 
water  performs  the  same  function  upon  the  sand  as  the  moved  air  does 
upon  the  water.  And  if  you  prove  that  the  bed  of  the  flat  sand  makes 
its  waves  and  becomes  uneven  through  the  unevenness  of  its  granules, 
and  that  such  unevenness  could  not  exist  on  the  surface  of  the  water 
which  is  a  smitten  and  uniform  body,  I  will  maintain  that  the  air  is  full 
of  parts  which  have  a  movement  that  is  not  uniform  and  therefore  the 
parts  moved  by  the  contact  of  the  air  move  without  uniformity. 

m  41  r. 

The  cause  which  makes  water  move  in  the  springs  contrary  to  the 
natural  course  of  its  gravity  works  in  the  same  way  in  all  the  humours 
in  all  species  of  animated  bodies.  And  just  as  the  blood  from  below 
surges  up  and  then  falls  back  should  a  vein  burst  in  the  forehead,  so 
the  water  rises  from  the  lowest  depth  of  the  sea  to  the  summits  of  the 
mountains,  and  there,  finding  the  springs  burst  open,  is  poured  out 
through  them  and  returns  to  the  depths  of  the  sea.  Have  you  ever  seen 
how  the  water  that  drips  from  the  severed  branches  of  the  vine  and 
falls  back  upon  its  roots  penetrates  these  and  so  rises  up  anew?  Thus 
it  is  with  the  water  that  falls  back  into  the  sea,  for  it  penetrates  through 
the  pores  of  the  earth  and  having  returned  into  the  power  of  its  mover, 
whence  it  rises  anew  with  violence  and  descends  in  its  accustomed 
course,  it  then  returns.  Thus  adhering  together  and  united  in  continual 
revolution  it  goes  moving  round  backwards  and  forwards;  at  times  it 
all  rises  together  with  fortuitous  movement,  at  times  descends  in 
natural  liberty.  Thus  moving  up  and  down,  backwards  and  forwards,  it 
never  rests  in  quiet  either  in  its  course  or  in  its  own  substance:  and  as 
the  mirror  is  changed  to  the  colour  of  the  objects  which  pass  before  it, 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  327 

it  has  nothing  of  itself  but  moves  or  takes  everything,  and  is  changed  to 
as  many  different  natures  as  the  places  are  different  through  which  it 
passes.  b.m.  58   v. 

That  principle  which  moves  the  watery  humours  contrary  to  the 
natural  course  of  their  gravity  in  all  living  species  moves  the  water 
also  through  the  springs  in  the  ground,  and  with  continual  solicitude 
renders  aid  in  all  those  places  in  which  necessity  teaches  it.  And  that 
which  is  seen  falling  down  from  high  places  and  forming  the  com- 
mencement of  the  course  of  every  river,  acts  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
blood  that  rises  up  from  the  lower  part  and  pours  itself  away  through 
a  cleft  in  the  forehead.  b.m.  59   r. 

From  the  two  lines  of  shells  one  must  needs  suppose  that  the  earth 
in  disdain  plunged  beneath  the  sea  and  so  formed  the  first  layer  and 
that  the  Flood  afterwards  formed  the  second.  b.m.  156  v. 

How  the  rivers  widen  the  valleys  and  wear  away  the  roots  of  the 
mountains  along  their  sides: 

The  windings  which  the  rivers  make  through  their  valleys  as  they 
leap  back  from  one  mountain  to  another  cause  the  bank  to  form  curves, 
and  these  curves  move  with  the  current  of  the  water  and  in  course  of 
time  seek  out  the  whole  valley,  unless  they  are  checked  by  the  fact  of  it 
becoming  increased  in  length  and  depth  and  diminished  in  breadth. 

b.m.  168  v. 

And  as  from  the  lower  part  of  the  vine  the  water  rises  to  the  severed 
branches,  and  falls  back  upon  its  roots  and  by  penetrating  these  rises 
up  again  to  the  point  where  they  are  broken  and  falls  back  afresh,  even 
so  does  the  water. 

So  from  the  lowest  depth  of  the  sea  the  water  raises  itself  and  rises  to 
the  summits  of  the  mountains,  and  as  the  water  pours  through  the 
severed  branches  of  the  vine  and  falls  back  upon  its  roots,  penetrating 
them,  even  so  does  the  water  which.  .  .  .  b.m.  233  r. 

So  does  the  water  which  is  moved  from  the  deep  sea  up  to  the  sum- 
mits of  the  mountains,  and  through  the  burst  veins  it  falls  down  again 
to  the  shallows  of  the  sea,  and  so  rises  again  to  the  height  where  it  burst 
through,  and  then  returns  in  the  same  descent.  Thus  proceeding  alter*

OF  THE  SEA 

If  the  water  becomes  so  salt  through  the  earth  being  burnt  up  by 
the  sun  it  should  follow  that  when  the  earth  is  boiled  in  water  this 
water  becomes  salt.  Quaderni  11   19  r. 

[Influence  of  sun  and  moon  on  tides] 

That  power  shows  itself  greater  which  is  impressed  upon  a  lesser 
resistance.  This  conclusion  is  universal  and  we  may  apply  it  to  the  flow 
and  ebb  in  order  to  prove  that  the  sun  or  moon  impresses  itself  more 
on  its  object,  that  is  on  the  waters,  when  these  are  of  less  depth.  Conse- 
quently the  shallow  waters  of  swamps  ought  to  receive  with  greater 
potency  the  cause  of  the  flow  and  ebb,  than  the  great  depths  of  the 
ocean.  Quaderni  11  22  v. 

[Filling  of  footprints  in  sand] 

When  the  foot  is  drawn  up  out  of  wet  sand  the  water  runs  back  right 
to  the  surface  of  the  sand,  and  this  occurs  because  the  water  which  is 
mingled  with  the  sand  is  quicker  to  fill  up  the  vacuum  left  by  the  foot 
than  the  sand  is,  and  the  air  would  be  even  quicker  if  it  could  enter; 
but  the  wet  sand  always  keeps  the  way  closed  up  by  which  the  leg 
entered  the  sand,  and  so  prevents  the  air  from  entering  to  fill  up  the 
vacuum.  Quaderni  iv  15  r. 

How  the  valleys  were  formerly  in  great  part  covered  by  lakes  be- 
cause their  soil  always  forms  a  bank  for  rivers,  and  by  seas  which  after- 
wards through  the  unceasing  action  of  the  rivers  that  form  the  store  of 
water  that  is  in  the  mfountains],  cut  through  the  mountains;  and  the 
rivers  in  their  wandering  courses  carried  away  the  wide  open  plains 
enclosed  by  the  mountains;  and  the  cuttings  of  the  mountains  are  per- 
ceptible from  the  strata  of  the  rocks  which  correspond  to  the  sections 
made  by  the  said  courses  of  the  rivers : 

The  Haemus  range  which  crosses  Thrace  and  Dardania  and  joins  on

the  west  the  Sardonius  range  as  it  proceeds  towards  the  west  changes 
the  name  of  Sardus  to  Rcbi  as  it  approaches  Dalmatia,  and  then  contin- 
uing towards  the  west  crosses  Illyria  now  called  Slavonia,  and  changes 
the  name  of  Rebi  to  Albanus,  and  still  continuing  westward  changes  it 
to  the  Ocra  range. 

To  the  north  and  south  above  Istria  it  is  named  Caruancas  (Caru- 
sadiusr),  and  to  the  west  above  Italy  it  unites  with  the  Adula  range 
where  the  Danube1  rises,  which  flows  for  a  course  of  fifteen  hundred 
miles  and  for  about  a  thousand  miles  in  the  most  direct  line;  and  for 
just  as  far  or  thereabouts  the  spur  of  the  Adula  range  is  changed  to 
the  names  of  the  mountains  already  mentioned. 

To  the  north  stands  the  Carpathian  range  which  encloses  the  breadth 
of  the  valley  of  the  Danube  which  as  I  have  stated  stretches  eastwards 
for  a  distance  of  about  a  thousand  miles  and  has  a  width  of  sometimes 
two  hundred  and  sometimes  three  hundred  miles.  Through  the  midst 
of  it  flows  the  Danube,  the  first  river  of  Europe  in  magnitude,  and  this 
Danube  as  it  flows  leaves  on  the  south  Austria  and  Albania  and  on  the 
north  Bavaria,  Poland,  Hungary,  Wallachia  and  Bosnia.  The  Danube 
or  as  it  is  called  the  Donau  then  flows  into  the  Black  Sea  which  used 
to  extend  almost  as  far  as  Austria  and  covered  all  the  plain  where 
to-day  the  Danube  flows;  and  the  sign  of  this  is  shown  by  the  oysters 
and  cockleshells  and  scollops  and  bones  of  great  fishes  which  are  still 
found  in  many  places  on  the  high  slopes  of  the  said  mountains;  and 
this  sea  was  created  by  the  filling  up  of  the  spurs  of  the  Adula  range 
which  extend  to  the  east  and  unite  with  the  spurs  of  the  Taurus  range 
extending  to  the  west.  And  near  Bithynia  the  waters  of  this  Black  Sea 
discharged  themselves  into  the  Propontis,  falling  into  the  Aegean  Sea, 
that  is  the  Mediterranean  Sea,  where  at  the  end  of  their  long  course  the 
spurs  of  the  Adula  range  are  severed  from  those  of  the  Taurus  range, 
and  the  Black  Sea  sank  down  and  laid  bare  the  valley  of  the  Danube 
with  the  above-named  provinces,  and  the  whole  of  Asia  Minor  beyond 
the  Taurus  range  to  the  north,  and  the  plain  which  stretches  from  the 
Caucasus  to  the  Black  Sea  to  the  west,  and  the  plain  of  Tanais  (the 
Don)  this  side  of  the  Ural  mountains  that  is  at  their  feet. 

So  the  Black  Sea  must  have  sunk  about  a  thousand  braccia  to  uncover 
such  vast  plains.  Leic.  1  v.

330  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

In  this  work  of  yours  you  have  first  to  prove  how  the  shells  at  a  height 
of  a  thousand  braccia  were  not  carried  there  by  the  Deluge,  because 
they  are  seen  at  one  and  the  same  level,  and  mountains  also  are  seen 
which  considerably  exceed  this  level,  and  to  enquire  whether  the  Del- 
uge was  caused  by  rain  or  by  the  sea  rising  in  a  swirling  flood;  and 
then  you  have  to  show  that  neither  by  rain  which  makes  the  rivers 
rise  in  flood  nor  by  the  swelling  up  of  the  sea  could  the  shells  being 
heavy  things  be  driven  by  the  sea  up  the  mountains  or  be  thrown  there 
by  the  rivers  contrary  to  the  course  of  their  waters.  Leic.  3  r. 

When  a  river  flows  out  from  among  mountains  it  deposits  a  great 
quantity  of  large  stones  in  its  gravelly  bed,  and  these  stones  still  retain 
some  part  of  their  angles  and  sides;  and  as  it  proceeds  on  its  course  it 
carries  with  it  the  lesser  stones  with  angles  more  worn  away,  and  so 
the  large  stones  become  smaller;  and  farther  on  it  deposits  first  coarse 
and  then  fine  gravel,  and  after  this  big  and  then  small  shingle,  and 
after  this  follows  sand  at  first  coarse  and  then  more  fine;  and  thus 
continuing  the  water  turbid  with  shingle  and  sand  reaches  the  sea. 

The  shingle  is  deposited  over  the  shores  of  the  sea  by  the  backwash 
of  the  salt  waves,  until  at  last  the  sand  becomes  so  fine  as  to  seem  al- 
most like  water.  Nor  does  this  remain  upon  the  sea  shores  but  goes 
back  with  the  wave  by  reason  of  its  lightness,  being  formed  of  rotting 
leaves  and  other  things  of  extreme  lightness;  and  consequently  being 
as  has  been  said  almost  of  the  nature  of  water  in  time  of  calm  weather 
it  drops  down  and  settles  at  the  bottom  of  the  sea,  where  by  reason 
of  its  fineness  it  becomes  compressed  and  resists  the  waves  which  pass 
above  it  on  account  of  its  smoothness;  and  in  this  shells  are  found  and 
this  is  the  white  earth  that  is  used  for  making  jugs.  Leic.  6  v. 


OF  THE  FLOOD  AND  OF  MARINE  SHELLS 

If  you  should  say  that  the  shells  which  are  visible  at  the  present  time 
within  the  borders  of  Italy,  far  away  from  the  sea  and  at  great 
heights,  are  due  to  the  Flood  having  deposited  them  there,  I  reply  that, 
granting  this  Flood  to  have  risen  seven  cubits  above  the  highest  moun- 
tain, as  he  has  written  who  measured  it,  these  shells  which  always  in- 
habit near  the  shores  of  the  sea  ought  to  be  found  lying  on  the  moun- 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  331 

tain  sides,  and  not  at  so  short  a  distance  above  their  bases,  and  all  at 
the  same  level,  layer  upon  layer. 

Should  you  say  also  that  the  nature  of  these  shells  causes  them  to 
keep  near  the  edge  of  the  sea,  and  that  as  the  sea  rose  in  height  the 
shells  left  their  former  place  and  followed  the  rising  waters  up  to  their 
highest  level: — to  this  I  reply  {that  in  forty  days  the  shells  cannot 
travel x)  that  the  cockle  is  a  creature  incapable  when  out  of  water  of 
more  rapid  movement  than  the  snail,  or  is  even  somewhat  slower, 
since  it  does  not  swim,  but  makes  a  furrow  in  the  sand,  and  support- 
ing itself  by  means  of  the  sides  of  this  furrow  will  travel  between  three 
and  four  braccia  in  a  day;  and  therefore  with  such  a  rate  of  motion  it 
would  not  have  travelled  from  the  Adriatic  Sea  as  far  as  Monferrato  in 
Lombardy,  a  distance  of  two  hundred  and  fifty  miles,  in  forty  days, — 
as  he  has  said  who  kept  a  record  of  this  time. 

And  if  you  say  that  the  waves  carried  them  there, — they  could  not 
move  by  reason  of  their  weight  except  upon  their  base.  And  if  you  do 
not  grant  me  this,  at  any  rate  allow  that  they  must  have  remained  on 
the  tops  of  the  highest  mountains,  and  in  the  lakes  which  are  shut  in 
among  the  mountains,  such  as  the  lake  of  Lario  or  Como,  and  Lake 
Maggiore  2,  and  that  of  Fiesole  and  of  Perugia  and  others. 

The  water  of  the  contingent  seas  forms  the  sphere  of  the  water  which 
has  for  the  centre  of  its  surface  the  centre  of  the  world  but  not  as  the 
centre  of  its  gravity,  because  in  many  places  it  is  of  great  depth  and  in 
many  of  small  depth,  and  for  this  reason  as  it  is  not  of  uniform  thick- 
ness it  is  not  of  uniform  weight.  But  merely  because  that  thing  is 
higher  which  is  more  remote  from  the  centre  of  the  world,  therefore 
this  surface  not  being  in  movement  cannot  remain  in  any  place  higher 
in  one  part  than  in  another,  because  the  highest  part  of  the  water  al- 
ways seeks  to  fill  up  with  itself  the  part  of  it  which  is  lower. 

If  the  Flood  passed  as  has  been  said,  above  the  mountains  of  our 
hemisphere,  without  doubt  it  made  the  gravity  of  this  our  habitable 
part  greater  than  that  of  the  antipodes,  and  as  a  consequence  it  brought 
it  nearer  to  the  centre  of  the  world  than  it  was  at  first;  and  the  part 
opposite  was  removed  farther  away  from  this  centre,  for  which  reason

332  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

the   aforesaid   Flood   submerged   more   than   would   have   been   sub- 
merged if  such  gravity  had  not  been  acquired  by  it  on  this  side. 

If  you  should  say  that  the  shells  were  empty  and  dead  when  carried 
by  the  waves,  I  reply  that  where  the  dead  ones  went  the  living  were 
not  far  distant,  and  in  these  mountains  are  found  all  living  ones,  for 
they  are  known  by  the  shells  being  in  pairs,  and  by  their  being  in  a  row 
without  any  dead,  and  a  little  higher  up  is  the  place  where  all  the  dead 
with  their  shells  separated  have  been  cast  up  by  the  waves.  Near  to 
there  the  rivers  plunged  into  the  sea  in  great  depth;  like  the  Arno 
which  fell  from  the  Gonfolina  near  to  Monte  Lupo  and  there  left 
gravel  deposits,  and  these  are  still  to  be  seen  welded  together,  forming 
of  various  kinds  of  stones  from  different  localities  and  of  varying  colour 
and  hardness  one  concrete  mass.  And  a  little  farther  on,  where  the 
river  turns  towards  Castel  Fiorentino  the  hardening  of  the  sand  has 
formed  tufa  stone;  and  below  this  it  has  deposited  the  mud  in  which 
the  shells  lived;  and  this  has  risen  in  layers  according  as  the  floods  of 
the  turbid  Arno  were  poured  into  this  sea,  and  so  from  time  to  time 
the  bed  of  the  sea  was  raised. 

This  has  caused  these  shells  to  be  produced  in  pairs,  as  is  shown  in 
the  cutting  of  Colle  Gonzoli,  made  sheer  by  the  river  Arno  which 
wears  away  its  base,  for  in  this  cutting  the  aforesaid  layers  of  shells 
may  be  seen  distinctly  in  the  bluish  clay,  and  there  may  be  found 
various  things  from  the  sea. 

And  the  earth  of  our  hemisphere  became  raised  up  more  than  it  was 
before  as  by  degrees  it  became  lightened  of  the  water  that  flowed  away 
from  it  through  the  straits  of  Gibraltar;  and  it  was  raised  so  much  the 
more  because  the  weight  of  the  water  which  flowed  away  from  it  was 
added  to  that  of  the  earth  that  was  turned  to  the  other  hemisphere. 

And  if  the  shells  had  been  in  the  turbid  water  of  a  deluge  they  would 
be  found  mixed  up  and  separated  one  from  another,  amid  the  mud, 
and  not  in  regular  rows  in  layers  as  we  see  them  in  our  own  times. 

Leic.  8  v. 

As  for  those  who  say  that  these  shells  are  found  to  exist  over  a  wide 
area  having  been  created  at  a  distance  from  the  sea  by  the  nature  of  the 
locality  and  the  disposition  of  the  heavens,  which  moves  and  influences 
the  place  to  such  a  creation  of  animal  life,  to  these  it  may  be  answered 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  333 

that  granted  such  an  Influence  over  these  animals  it  could  not  happen 

that  they  were  in  one  line  except  in  the  case  of  animals  of  the  same 
species  and  age;  and  not  the  old  with  the  young,  nor  one  with  an  outer 
covering  and  another  without  its  covering,1  nor  one  broken  and  an- 
other whole,  one  filled  with  sea  sand,  and  the  fragments  great  and 
small  of  others  inside  the  whole  shells  which  stand  gaping  open;  nor 
the  claws  of  crabs  without  the  rest  of  their  bodies;  nor  with  the  shells 
of  other  species  fastened  on  to  them  like  animals  crawling  over  them 
and  leaving  the  mark  of  their  track  on  the  outside  where  it  has  eaten 
its  way  like  a  worm  in  wood;  nor  would  there  be  found  among 
them  bones  and  fishes'  teeth  which  some  call  arrows  and  others  ser- 
pents' tongues;  nor  would  so  many  parts  of  different  animals  be  found 
joined  together,  unless  they  had  been  thrown  up  there  upon  the  borders 
of  the  sea. 

And  the  Flood  would  not  have  carried  them  there  because  things 
heavier  than  water  do  not  float  upon  the  surface  of  the  water,  and  the 
aforesaid  things  could  not  be  at  such  heights  unless  they  had  been  car- 
ried there  floating  on  the  waves,  and  that  is  impossible  on  account  of 
their  weight. 

Where  the  valleys  have  never  been  covered  by  the  salt  waters  of  the 
sea  there  the  shells  are  never  found;  as  is  plainly  visible  in  the  great 
valley  of  the  Arno  above  Gonfolina,  a  rock  which  was  once  united  with 
Monte  Albano  in  the  form  of  a  very  high  bank.  This  kept  the  river 
dammed  up  in  such  a  way  that  before  it  could  empty  itself  into  the 
sea  which  was  afterwards  at  the  foot  of  this  rock  it  formed  two  large 
lakes,  the  first  of  which  is  where  we  now  see  the  city  of  Florence 
flourish  together  with  Prato  and  Pistoia;  and  Monte  Albano  followed 
the  rest  of  the  bank  down  to  where  now  stands  Serravalle.  In  the  up- 
per part  of  the  Val  d'Arno  as  far  as  Arezzo  a  second  lake  was  formed 
and  this  emptied  its  waters  into  the  above-mentioned  lake.  It  was  shut 
in  at  about  where  now  we  see  Girone,  and  it  filled  all  the  valley  above 
for  a  distance  of  forty  miles.  This  valley  received  upon  its  base  all  the 
earth  carried  down  by  the  turbid  waters  and  it  is  still  to  be  seen  at  its 
maximum  height  at  the  foot  of  Prato  Magno  for  there  the  rivers  have 
not  worn  it  away. 

Within  this  soil  may  be  seen  the  deep  cuttings  of  the  rivers  which 

1  MS.  e  l'altro  essere  colla  sua  copritura. 


334  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

have  passed  there  in  their  descent  from  the  great  mountain  of  Prato 
Magno;  in  which  cuttings  there  are  no  traces  visible  of  any  shells  or  of 
marine  earth. 

This  lake  was  joined  to  that  of  Perugia. 

A  great  quantity  of  shells  may  be  seen  where  the  rivers  empty  them- 
selves into  the  sea,  because  in  such  places  the  water  is  not  very  salt  on 
account  of  the  mixture  of  the  fresh  water  which  unites  with  it.  A  proof 
of  this  is  to  be  seen  where  the  Apennines  once  emptied  their  rivers  into 
the  waters  of  the  Adriatic,  for  there  among  the  mountains  in  most 
parts  a  great  quantity  of  shells  are  visible  together  with  bluish  marine 
clay;  and  all  the  rocks  which  are  broken  away  in  such  places  are  found 
to  be  full  of  shells. 

We  know  that  the  Arno  did  the  same  when  it  fell  from  the  rock  of 
Gonfolina  into  the  sea  which  was  not  very  far  below  it,  because  in  those 
times  it  must  have  stood  higher  than  the  top  of  San  Miniato  al  Tedesco, 
since  in  the  highest  summits  of  this  [mountain]  one  sees  the  rocks  full 
of  shells  and  oysters  within  its  banks;  the  shells  did  not  extend  in  the 
direction  of  Val  di  Nievole  because  the  fresh  waters  of  the  Arno  did 
not  extend  so  far. 

How  the  shells  were  not  carried  from  the  sea  by  the  Deluge,  because 
the  waters  which  came  from  the  earth  to  the  sea  although  they  drew 
the  sea  towards  the  earth  were  those  which  smote  its  base,  because  the 
water  which  comes  from  the  earth  has  a  stronger  current  than  that  of 
the  sea,  and  as  a  consequence  is  more  powerful  and  enters  beneath  the 
other  water  of  the  sea,  and  stirs  up  the  bottom  and  carries  with  it  all 
the  movable  objects  which  are  to  be  found  in  it  such  as  the  above- 
mentioned  shells  and  other  like  things;  and  as  the  water  which  comes 
from  the  land  is  muddier  than  that  of  the  sea  it  is  so  much  the  more 
powerful  and  heavier  than  it.  I  do  not  see  therefore  in  what  way  the 
said  shells  could  have  come  to  be  so  far  inland  unless  they  had  been 
born  there. 

If  you  should  tell  me  that  the  river  Loire  which  passes  through 
France  spreads  itself  over  more  than  eighty  miles  of  country  when  the 
sea  is  increased,  because  the  country  forms  a  great  plain  and  the  sea 
rises  about  twenty  braccia,  and  that  shells  are  sometimes  found  in  this 
plain  at  a  distance  of  eighty  miles  from  the  sea,  the  reply  is  that  the 
flow  and  ebb  in  our  Mediterranean  seas  does  not  cause  so  much  varia- 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  335 

don  because  in  the  Gulf  of  Genoa  it  does  not  vary  at  all,  at  Venice  and 
in  Africa  only  a  little,  and  where  it  varies  only  a  little  it  covers  but  little 
of  the  country.  Leic.  9  r. 

Refutation  of  such  as  say  that  the  shells  were  carried  a  distance  of 
many  days'  journey  from  the  sea  by  reason  of  the  Deluge. 

I  hold  that  the  Deluge  would  not  be  able  to  carry  up  into  the  moun- 
tains objects  native  to  the  sea  unless  the  sea  had  become  so  swollen  as  to 
form  a  flood  so  great  that  it  even  mounted  above  the  height  of  these 
same  places,  and  this  process  could  not  have  occurred  because  it  would 
have  created  a  vacuum;  and  if  you  should  say  that  the  air  would  rush 
in  there  we  have  already  concluded  that  what  is  heavy  cannot  be  sup- 
ported on  what  is  light  wherefore  we  conclude  of  necessity  that  this 
Deluge  was  caused  by  rain  water;  and  if  this  was  the  case  all  this 
water  flowed  into  the  sea  and  the  sea  does  not  flow  up  the  mountains; 
and  if  it  ran  into  the  sea  it  pushed  the  shells  along  the  shore  into  the 
sea  and  did  not  draw  them  to  itself.  And  if  you  should  say  that  be- 
cause the  sea  was  raised  by  rain  water  it  carried  these  shells  to  such  a 
height,  we  have  already  stated  that  things  heavier  than  water  cannot 
float  upon  its  surface  but  remain  at  the  bottom  and  are  not  moved  from 
there  unless  by  pressure  from  the  waves.  And  if  you  were  to  say  that 
it  was  the  waves  which  had  carried  them  to  these  high  places  we  have 
proved  that  the  waves  when  of  great  depth  move  in  an  opposite  di- 
rection at  their  base  to  their  movement  above,  this  being  shown  by  the 
turbidity  of  the  sea  arising  from  the  soil  that  has  been  washed  away 
near  its  shores. 

An  object  lighter  than  water  moves  with  its  wave  and  it  is  left  on  the 
highest  spot  of  the  bank  by  the  highest  wave;  an  object  heavier  than 
water  moves  only  when  driven  by  its  wave  along  the  surface  of  its  bed. 
And  from  these  two  conclusions  which  in  their  places  will  be  fully 
proved  we  may  conclude  that  the  wave  of  the  surface  cannot  carry 
shells  because  they  are  heavier  than  water;  and  consequently  they  will 
be  driven  by  the  lower  wave  when  the  wind  comes  from  the  land,  be- 
cause when  the  wind  comes  from  the  land  the  wave  at  the  bottom  of 
the  sea  moves  in  the  opposite  direction  to  the  course  of  the  wind  which 
is  then  prevailing;  and  this  moreover  will  not  cause  the  shells  to  be 
carried  to  the  mountains,  because  the  water  at  the  bottom  which  moves 


336  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

in  the  opposite  direction  to  the  wind  will  be  so  much  slower  than  the 
wave  of  the  surface  as  it  is  deeper  than  the  height  of  the  wave.  This 
is  evident  because  if  the  wave  of  the  surface  is  the  height  of  one  braccio 
and  there  are  a  hundred  braccia  of  water  below  it  then  without  doubt 
the  lower  wave  will  be  a  hundred  times  slower  than  the  upper  wave,  as 
is  shown  in  the  seventh  proposition.  The  upper  wave  will  never  turn 
back  on  its  base  with  any  great  force  unless  the  depth  of  the  water  that 
is  below  the  wave  is  equal  to  that  of  the  wave. 

The  tiny  wave  which  may  be  seen  on  the  high  seas  travelling  against 
the  course  of  the  wind  will  not  pass  over  its  base,  that  is  it  will  not 
touch  it  but  will  dissolve  at  contact  with  the  surface  wave.  I  hold  that 
such  movement  of  water,  changing  from  its  surface  to  its  base,  re- 
sembles that  which  takes  place  on  the  surface  between  two  banks,  see- 
ing that  if  a  third  of  the  expanse  of  the  river  be  moving  towards  the 
west,  another  third  will  move  towards  the  east  and  the  remainder  to 
the  west;  and  if  there  should  be  another  similar  part  there  that  would 
return  to  the  east.  The  lateral  movements  of  rivers  will  become  slower 
in  proportion  as  they  are  farther  removed  from  the  first  current.  As 
regards  the  friction  created  by  water  inside  other  water  and  moving 
more  swiftly,  whether  it  divides  immediately,  that  is  whether  the  edges 
of  this  body  of  water  are  worn  away  or  follow  one  after  another,  that 
is  the  swifter  portion  carrying  the  less  swift  with  it, — I  maintain  that 
this  is  not  the  case,  for  if  it  carried  with  it  more  water  than  usual  it 
would  grow  to  such  a  size  during  its  long  course  that  it  would  be  carry- 
ing with  it  all  the  water  of  the  river. 

Why  the  oysters  are  very  seldom  found  dead  on  the  shores  of  the 
sea  is  because  usually  they  live  fastened  to  the  rocks  at  the  bottom  of 
the  sea  and  are  incapable  of  movement  except  in  the  half  which  is 
sensitive  and  light.  The  other  valve  is  fixed  to  the  stone  or  if  not  fixed 
nature  has  caused  them  to  grow  larger  and  so  to  become  so  heavy  that 
the  small  amount  of  undulation  which  takes  place  in  the  vast  depths  of 
the  sea  cannot  easily  dislodge  them.  But  the  valve  that  has  the  power 
of  movement  is  very  light  and  performs  the  same  function  for  it  as  the 
lid  does  for  a  chest.  And  when  the  oyster  feeds,  its  food  walks  into  the 
house  of  its  own  accord,  for  it  consists  of  certain  animalculae  which 
feed  round  the  shells  of  the  dead  ones  and  which  consequendy  are 
found  where  there  are  a  great  many  shells  of  dead  oysters.  If  the 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  337 

Deluge  had  carried  the  shells  lor  distances  ol  three  and  tour  hundred 
miles  from  the  sea  it  would  have  brought  them  with  the  various  diiTer- 
ent  species  mixed  up,  all  heaped  up  together;  but  even  at  such  dis- 
tances from  the  sea  we  see  the  oysters  all  together  and  also  the  shell-fish 
and  the  cuttle-fish  and  all  the  other  shells  which  stand  together  in  com- 
panies, found  all  together  dead,  and  the  single  shells  are  found  one  at 
a  distance  from  another  as  we  see  them  every  day  on  the  sea  shores. 

And  we  find  the  oysters  together  in  very  large  families,  among  which 
some  may  be  seen  with  their  shells  still  joined  together,  which  serves  to 
indicate  that  they  were  left  there  by  the  sea  and  that  they  were  still 
living  when  the  straits  of  Gibraltar  were  cut  through. 

In  the  mountains  of  Parma  and  Piacenza  multitudes  of  shells  and 
corals  filled  with  worm-holes  may  be  seen  still  adhering  to  the  rocks, 
and  when  I  was  making  the  great  horse  at  Milan  a  large  sack  of  those 
which  had  been  found  in  these  parts  was  brought  to  my  workshop  by 
some  peasants,  and  among  them  were  many  which  were  still  in  their 
original  condition. 

Under  the  ground  and  down  in  the  deep  excavations  of  the  stone- 
quarries  timbers  of  worked  beams  are  found  which  have  already  be- 
come black.  They  have  been  found  during  my  time  in  the  excavations 
made  at  Castel  Fiorentino,  and  they  were  buried  there  before  the  sand 
deposited  by  the  Arno  in  the  sea  which  then  flowed  over  the  spot  had 
been  raised  to  such  a  height,  and  before  the  plains  of  the  Casentino  had 
been  so  much  lowered  by  the  removal  of  the  earth  which  the  Arno  was 
continually  washing  away  from  them. 

In  Candia,  in  Lombardy,  near  to  Alessandria  della  Paglia,  while 
some  men  were  engaged  in  digging  a  well  for  Messer  Gualtieri  who 
has  a  house  there,  the  skeleton  of  a  very  large  ship  was  found  at  a 
depth  of  about  ten  braccia  beneath  the  ground;  and  as  the  timber  was 
black  and  in  excellent  condition,  Messer  Gualtieri  thought  fit  to  have 
the  mouth  of  the  well  enlarged  in  such  a  way  that  the  ends  of  the  ship 
should  be  uncovered. 

The  red  stone  of  the  mountains  of  Verona  is  found  with  shells  all 
intermingled  which  have  become  part  of  this  stone,  and  their  mouths 
have  become  sealed  up  by  the  cement  of  which  the  stone  has  been 
formed,  and  portions  of  them  have  remained  separated  from  the  rest 
of  the  mass  of  stone  which  enclosed  them,  because  the  outer  covering  of 


338  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

the  shell  intervened  and  thus  prevented  them  from  uniting;  and  in 
other  cases  this  cement  has  petrified  the  old  broken  outer  covering. 

And  if  you  should  say  that  these  shells  have  been  and  still  constantly 
are  being  created  in  such  places  as  these  by  the  nature  of  the  locality 
and  through  the  potency  of  the  heavens  in  those  spots,  such  an  opinion 
cannot  exist  in  brains  possessed  of  any  extensive  powers  of  reasoning 
because  the  years  of  their  growth  are  numbered  upon  the  outer  cover- 
ings of  their  shells;  and  both  small  and  large  ones  may  be  seen,  and 
these  would  not  have  grown  without  feeding  or  feed  without  move- 
ment, and  here  they  would  not  be  able  to  move.  Leic.  9  v. 

How  the  northern  bases  of  certain  Alps  are  not  yet  petrified;  this  is 
seen  clearly  where  the  rivers  which  cut  through  them  flow  towards  the 
north,  for  these  cut  through  the  strata  of  the  living  rock  in  the  moun- 
tain heights;  and  where  they  unite  with  the  plains  these  strata  are  all  of 
clay  that  serves  to  make  pots,  as  is  seen  in  the  Val  di  Lamona  where 
the  river  Lamona  as  it  issues  from  the  Apennines  does  these  same 
things  in  its  banks. 

How  the  rivers  have  all  sawn  through  and  divided  the  members  of 
the  great  Alps  one  from  another;  and  this  is  revealed  by  the  arrange- 
ment of  the  stratified  rocks,  in  which  from  the  summit  of  the  moun- 
tain down  to  the  river  one  sees  the  strata  on  the  one  side  of  the  river 
corresponding  with  those  on  the  other.  How  the  stratified  rocks  of  the 
mountains  are  all  in  layers  of  mud  deposited  one  above  another  by  the 
floods  of  the  rivers.  How  the  different  thicknesses  of  the  strata  of  the 
rocks  are  created  by  the  different  floods  of  the  rivers,  that  is  the  greater 
and  the  less  floods. 

How  between  the  various  layers  of  the  stone  are  still  to  be  found  the 
tracks  of  the  worms  which  crawled  about  upon  them  when  it  was  not 
yet  dry.  How  all  the  marine  clays  still  contain  shells,  and  the  shell  is 
petrified  together  with  the  clay.  Of  the  stupidity  and  ignorance  of  those 
who  imagine  that  these  creatures  were  carried  to  such  places  distant 
from  the  sea  by  the  Deluge. 

How  another  set  of  ignoramuses  maintain  that  nature  or  the  heavens 
have  created  them  in  these  places  through  celestial  influences;  as 
though  in  those  places  one  did  not  find  the  bones  of  fishes  which  have 
taken  a  long  time  to  grow;  as  though  one  could  not  count  on  the  shells 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

or  cockles  and  snails  the  number  of  the  months  and  years  nl  their  lives, 
fust  as  one  can  on  the  horns  of  bulls  and  wethers  and  in  the  ramifica- 
tion of  plants  when  they  have  never  been  cut  in  any  part.  And  having 
shown  by  these  signs  that  the  length  of  their  life  is  evident,  it  must 
needs  be  admitted  that  these  animals  could  not  live  without  the  power 
of  movement  in  order  to  seek  their  food,  and  we  cannot  see  that  they 
are  equipped  with  any  instrument  for  penetrating  the  earth  or  stone  in 
which  they  find  themselves  enclosed.  But  how  could  one  find  in  the 
shell  of  a  large  snail  fragments  and  bits  of  many  other  sorts  of  shells  of 
different  kinds  unless  they  had  been  thrown  into  it  by  the  waves  of  the 
sea  as  it  lay  dead  upon  the  shore  like  the  other  light  things  which  the 
sea  casts  up  on  the  land  ? 

Why  do  we  find  so  many  fragments  and  whole  shells  between  the 
different  layers  of  the  stone  unless  they  had  been  upon  the  shore  and 
had  been  covered  over  by  earth  newly  thrown  up  by  the  sea  which  then 
became  petrified?  And  if  the  above-mentioned  Deluge  had  carried 
them  to  these  places  from  the  sea,  you  would  find  the  shells  at  the  edge 
of  one  layer  of  rock  only,  not  at  the  edge  of  many  where  may  be 
counted  the  winters  of  the  years  during  which  the  sea  multiplied  the 
layers  of  sand  and  mud  brought  down  by  the  neighbouring  rivers,  and 
spread  them  over  its  shores.  And  if  you  should  wish  to  say  that  there 
must  have  been  many  deluges  in  order  to  produce  these  layers  and  the 
shells  among  them  it  would  then  become  necessary  for  you  to  affirm 
that  such  a  deluge  took  place  every  year.  Further  as  regards  the  frag- 
ments of  these  shells,  it  must  be  presumed  that  in  such  a  locality  there 
was  a  sea  beach,  where  the  shells  were  all  cast  up  broken  and  divided 
and  never  in  pairs  as  they  are  found  in  the  sea  when  alive,  with  two 
valves  which  form  a  covering  the  one  to  the  other.  And  within  the 
layers  of  the  banks  of  rivers  and  of  sea  shores  they  are  found  broken; 
and  on  the  edges  of  the  rocks  they  are  found  infrequently  and  with  the 
two  valves  together,  like  those  which  were  left  by  the  sea  buried  alive 
within  the  mud  which  afterwards  dried  up  and  in  time  became  petri- 
fied. Leic.  10  r. 

And  if  you  should  say  that  it  was  the  Deluge  that  carried  these  shells 
away  from  the  sea  tor  hundreds  of  miles,  this  cannot  have  happened  for 
the  Deluge  came  about  as  the  result  of  rains,  because  the  rains  natu- 


340  PHYSICAL   GEOGRAPHY 

rally  cause  the  rivers  together  with  the  objects  carried  by  them  to  rush 
towards  the  sea  and  they  do  not  draw  up  to  the  mountains  the  dead 
things  on  the  sea  shores. 

And  if  you  should  say  that  the  Deluge  then  rose  with  its  waters  above 
the  mountains,  the  movement  of  the  sea  in  its  journey  against  the 
course  of  the  rivers  would  have  been  so  slow  that  it  would  not  have 
been  able  to  carry  things  heavier  than  itself  floating  in  it;  or  if  some- 
how it  had  had  them  floating  in  it  then  as  it  subsided  it  would  have 
left  them  strewn  about  in  various  places.  But  how  are  we  to  account  for 
the  fact  of  the  corals  being  found  every  day  round  about  Monferrato 
in  Lombardy  with  worm-holes  in  them,  sticking  to  the  rocks  which 
have  been  left  bare  by  the  currents  of  the  rivers?  And  the  said  rocks 
are  all  covered  with  stocks  and  families  of  oysters,  which  as  we  know 
do  not  move  but  always  remain  fixed  by  one  of  their  valves  to  the  rock, 
having  the  other  open  in  order  to  feed  upon  the  animalculae  that  are 
swimming  about  the  waters  and  which  while  hoping  to  find  good  pas- 
ture become  the  food  of  the  above-mentioned  shells.  Is  it  not  found 
that  the  sand  that  is  mixed  with  the  seaweed  has  become  petrified  when 
the  seaweed  which  has  divided  it  has  become  less?  And  of  this  the  Po 
affords  instances  every  day  in  the  debris  of  its  banks. 

At  Alessandria  della  Paglia  in  Lombardy  there  is  no  other  stone  from 
which  to  make  lime  except  such  as  is  made  up  of  an  infinite  number  of 
things  native  to  the  sea;  but  it  is  now  more  than  two  hundred  miles 
distant  from  the  sea. 

In  eighty-nine  [the  year  1489]  there  was  an  earthquake  in  the  sea  of 
Satalia  near  to  Rhodes,  and  it  opened  the  depths  of  the  sea  and  into  the 
opening  that  was  made  such  a  torrent  of  water  was  poured  that  for 
more  than  three  hours  the  bed  of  the  sea  lay  bare  because  of  the  water 
which  had  been  lost  from  it,  and  then  it  closed  up  again  to  its  former 
level.  Whatever  changes  may  occur  in  the  weight  of  the  earth  the  sur- 
face of  the  sphere  of  waters  will  never  cease  to  be  equidistant  from  the 
centre  of  the  world. 

The  bosom  of  the  Mediterranean  like  a  sea  received  the  principal 
waters  of  Africa,  Asia  and  Europe;  for  they  were  turned  towards  it  and 
came  with  their  waters  to  the  base  of  the  mountains  which  surrounded 
it  and  formed  its  banks. 

And  the  peaks  of  the  Apennines  stood  up  in  this  sea  in  the  form  of 


PHYSICAL  (i  EOG  RA  I'HY  341 

islands  surrounded  by  salt  water.  Nor  did  Africa  as  yet  behind  its  Adas 

mountains  reveal  the  earth  of  its  great  plains  naked  to  the  sky  some 
three  thousand  miles  in  extent;  and  on  the  shore  of  this  sea  stood 
Memphis;  and  above  the  plains  of  Italy  where  flocks  of  birds  are  flying 
to-day  fishes  were  once  moving  in  large  shoals.  Leic.  10  v. 

That  there  are  springs  which  as  a  result  of  earthquakes  or  other  un- 
foreseen causes  suddenly  burst  forth  and  as  suddenly  fail.  And  this 
happened  in  a  mountain  in  Savoy  where  certain  woods  sank  in  and  left 
a  very  deep  abyss;  and  at  about  four  miles  distance  from  there  the 
ground  opened  on  the  slope  of  a  mountain  and  threw  out  suddenly  an 
immense  flood  of  water,  which  swept  through  a  whole  valley  of  tilled 
fields  vineyards  and  houses  and  did  irreparable  damage  wherever  it 
spread. 

That  there  are  many  springs  which  come  to  fail  suddenly:  and  this 
happens  through  some  subsidence  in  a  cavern  that  is  pent  up  within 
the  body  of  the  earth  whereby  the  passage  of  the  said  springs  is 
blocked  and  hindered. 

That  there  are  many  springs  which  spring  up  suddenly  and  are 
permanent;  and  this  occurs  when  some  river  in  its  long  course  has 
worn  away  so  much  of  the  mountain  that  it  bursts  open  springs  of 
water  which  have  a  passage  there;  it  may  also  occur  as  I  said  before 
when  a  cave  has  fallen  in  ruin  and  blocked  up  a  spring,  so  that  its 
water  has  been  forced  up  to  such  a  height  in  this  cavern  that  it  reaches 
the  level  of  some  fissure  in  the  rock  and  so  has  made  its  escape,  creat- 
ing a  new  river. 

That  many  springs  of  salt  water  are  found  at  great  distances  from 
the  sea;  and  this  may  have  come  about  because  these  springs  have 
passed  through  some  mine  of  salt  like  that  in  Hungary  where  the  salt 
is  hewn  out  of  immense  quarries  just  as  blocks  of  stone  are. 

That  within  rocks  surrounded  by  salt  waters  and  within  these  salt 
waters  themselves  in  the  same  way  there  rise  in  many  places  springs  of 
fresh  water. 

That  there  are  in  many  places  springs  of  water  which  rise  for  six 
hours  and  sink  for  six  hours;  and  I  have  myself  seen  one  above  Lake 
Como  called  Fonte  Pliniana  which  increases  and  decreases  in  this  way 
to  such  an  extent  that  when  it  is  flowing  it  grinds  two  mills,  and  when

it  fails  it  falls  so  low  that  it  is  as  though  one  were  looking  at  the  water 
in  a  deep  well.  Leic.  n  v. 

A  tempest  on  the  sea  is  much  more  violent  near  to  the  shore  than  on 
the  high  sea;  and  this  is  the  case  because  the  recoil  of  the  waves  is  strik- 
ing the  sea  on  the  one  side  and  the  wind  strikes  it  on  the  other,  and  this 
causes  the  wave  to  be  higher  and  more  topped  with  spray.  Leic.  12  r. 

How  the  flow  and  ebb  of  the  tide  is  not  uniform,  for  on  the  coast  of 
Genoa  there  is  none;  at  Venice  it  makes  a  variation  of  two  braccia;  be- 
tween England  and  France  of  eighteen  braccia.  How  the  current  that 
flows  through  the  straits  of  Sicily  is  very  powerful  because  through 
these  there  pass  all  the  waters  of  the  rivers  which  discharge  themselves 
into  the  Adriatic. 

When  the  surface  of  the  water  consists  of  small  shaded  waves  which 
form  themselves  into  lines  that  meet  in  an  angle,1  the  fact  shows  that 
the  bed  of  the  river  is  not  far  away,  and  it  is  also  produced  by  the  sand 
thrown  off  by  the  water  as  it  passes  through  a  confined  space  such  as 
the  arch  of  a  bridge  or  the  like.  When  the  lines  of  its  surface  form  a 
curved  or  crescent  shaped  figure  this  is  a  sign  of  its  lack  of  depth,  for 
it  is  caused  by  the  sand  carried  by  the  greater  current  into  the  lesser, 
that  is  by  the  less  sluggish  to  the  more  sluggish,  since  both  of  them  have 
but  little  speed  or  depth.  When  the  surface  of  the  water  shows  itself  as 
a  straight  line  or  just  a  little  bent  with  tiny  waves  and  these  with  but 
little  sheen  or  brightness  there  is  very  little  depth  there;  and  this  is 
caused  by  two  currents  one  slower  than  the  other  which  join  together 
again  below  the  island  that  divides  them  higher  up;  for  these  have 
caused  the  sand  which  each  bore  with  it  to  settle,  because  it  is  deposited 
at  the  point  of  their  junction,  since  at  this  spot  their  movement  ended.

Why  the  bones  of  great  fishes  and  oysters  and  corals  and  various

back  the  brightness  that  is  visible  in  this  atmosphere;  and  the  blue 
that  appears  in  it  is  caused  by  the  darkness  which  is  hidden  behind 
this  atmosphere.

The  sea  shuts  itself  in  among  the  great  valleys  of  the  earth;  and  this 
earth  serves  as  a  cup  for  the  sea;  and  the  lips  of  the  cup  are  the  shores 
of  the  seas,  and  if  these  were  taken  away  the  sea  would  cover  all  the 
earth;  but  because  every  part  of  the  earth  that  is  uncovered  is  higher 
than  the  greatest  height  of  the  sea  this  sea  cannot  flow  over  it,  but 
merely  contents  itself  with  covering  that  earth  which  serves  as  its  bed. 
Many,  however,  in  ignorance  of  this  thing,  have  presumptuously  writ- 
ten how  the  surface  of  the  water  of  the  sea  is  higher  than  the  highest 
mountain  that  can  be  found;  as  regards  which  thing,  although  they 
see  the  bank  higher  than  the  water,  they  are  extremely  blind  who  say 
that  it  is  a  miracle  for  the  water  in  the  midst  of  the  sea  to  be  higher 
than  its  shore  or  than  the  promontories  which  jut  out  over  the  sea.  But 
this  fallacy  arises  from  the  fact  that  they  imagine  a  straight  line  of 
indefinite  length  extended  above  the  middle  of  the  sea,  which  without 
doubt  will  be  higher  than  the  said  shores,  because  the  earth  is  a 
sphere  and  its  surface  forms  a  curve,  and  the  farther  it  is  removed 
from  its  middle  the  more  it  becomes  remote  from  the  said  straight 
line;  the  fact  of  it  becoming  lower  in  this  condition  is  that  which  has 
deceived  them;  and  it  is  this  reason  which  will  be  brought  forward

by  the  adversary.  'That  part  of  the  water  will  be  higher  which  is  more 
remote  from  the  centre  of  the  world'. 

Observe  that  here  there  is  no  place  for  the  straight  unending  a  b  of 
the  adversary,  because  b  g  exceeds  the  line  e  g  by  the  whole  part  b  n; 
and  by  this  it  is  confirmed  that  the  surface  of  the  seas  which  are  joined 
together  are  equally  distant  from  the  centre  of  the  earth.  'The  highest 
mountains  are  as  far  above  the  sea  as  the  lowest  depths  of  the  sea  arc 
below  the  air.' 

For  a  long  time  the  water  of  the  Mediterranean  flowed  through  the 
Red  Sea  which  is  a  hundred  miles  wide  and  fifteen  hundred  miles 
long,  all  full  of  reefs;  and  it  has  worn  away  the  sides  of  Mount  Sinai, 
which  circumstance  does  not  point  to  a  flood  from  the  Indian  Ocean 
having  struck  upon  these  shores  but  to  a  great  deluge  of  water  which 
carried  with  it  all  the  rivers  which  are  very  numerous  round  the  Medi- 
terranean, and  also  the  ebb  of  the  sea.  And  afterwards  Mount  Calpe 
was  cut  through  in  the  west,  three  thousand  miles  distant  from  this 
spot,  and  separated  from  Mount  Abyla;  and  this  cutting  took  place 
at  the  lowest  spot  in  the  wide  plains  which  lie  between  Abyla  and  the 
ocean,  in  the  low  part  at  the  foot  of  the  mountain,  helped  by  the 
hollowing  out  of  some  valley  caused  by  some  river  which  must  have 
flowed  there.  Hercules  came  to  open  the  sea  in  the  west,  and  then  the 
waters  of  the  sea  commenced  to  flow  into  the  western  ocean;  and  as  a 
consequence  of  this  great  fall  the  Red  Sea  remained  the  higher, 
and  therefore  the  waters  have  ceased  to  flow  in  that  direction  but  have 
always  ever  since  poured  through  the  Straits  of  Spain  [Gibraltar]. 

On  the  shores  of  the  Mediterranean  three  hundred  rivers  are  found 
discharging  their  waters  and  there  are  some  forty  thousand  two  hun- 
dred harbours,  and  this  sea  is  three  thousand  miles  in  length.  Many 
times  the  swollen  waters  of  the  sea  have  been  heaped  up  by  its  reflux, 
by  the  western  gales,  the  flooding  of  the  Nile  and  of  the  rivers  which 
flow  into  the  Black  Sea.  So  the  seas  came  to  be  so  much  raised  that 
they  have  flowed  over  many  countries  causing  immense  floods;  and 
these  floods  occur  at  the  time  when  the  sun  melts  the  snow  on  the 
high  mountains  of  Ethiopia  which  rise  into  the  cold  regions  of  the 
air;  even  so  is  it  as  the  sun  approaches  near  to  the  mountains  of  Sar- 
matia  in  Asia  and  to  those  in  Europe;  so  that  the  accumulations 
occasioned  by  these  three  above-mentioned  things  are  and  have  been 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  345 

the  cause  of  the  greatest  Hoods,  namely  the  ebb  oi  the  sea,  the  western 

wind  and  the  melting  of  the  snows.  And  all  things  have  been  over- 
whelmed in  swirling  Hood  in  Syria,  Samaria,  Judaea  between  Sinai 
and  Lebanon,  and  in  the  rest  of  Syria  between  Lebanon  and  Mount 
Taurus,  and  in  Cilicia  within  the  mountains  of  Armenia,  and  in 
Pamphylia  and  in  Lycia  within  the  Celenian  mountains,  and  in 
Egypt  as  far  as  Mount  Atlas.  The  Persian  Gulf  which  was  once  a  vast 
lake  of  the  Tigris  and  had  its  outlet  into  the  Indian  Ocean,  has  now 
worn  away  the  mountain  which  served  it  as  a  bank,  and  become  the 
same  level  as  the  Indian  Ocean.  And  if  the  Mediterranean  had  con- 
tinued to  find  an  outlet  through  the  Gulf  of  Arabia  it  would  have 
produced  the  same  result,  that  is  it  would  have  caused  its  level  to 
become  the  same  as  that  of  the  Indian  Ocean.

In  this  one  has  to  imagine  the  earth  sawn  through  the  centre;  and  it 
will  show  the  depth  of  the  sea  and  of  the  earth;  [and  how]  the 
springs  start  from  the  bottoms  of  the  seas,  and  wind  their  way 
through  the  earth,  and  raise  themselves  to  the  summits  of  the  moun- 
tains, and  flow  back  again  through  the  rivers,  and  return  to  the  sea. 

Since  things  are  far  more  ancient  than  letters,  it  is  not  to  be  won- 
dered at  if  in  our  days  there  exists  no  record  of  how  the  aforesaid  seas 
extended  over  so  many  countries;  and  if  moreover  such  record  ever 
existed,  the  wars,  the  conflagrations,  the  changes  in  speech  and  habits, 
the  deluges  of  the  waters,  have  destroyed  every  vestige  of  the  past.  But 
sufficient  for  us  is  the  testimony  of  things  produced  in  the  salt  waters 
and  now  found  again  in  the  high  mountains,  sometimes  at  a  distance 
from  the  seas.  Leic.  31  r. 

That  part  of  the  flow  and  ebb  of  the  sea  will  be  of  greater  variety 
from  its  greatest  height  to  its  lowest  depth  which  is  nearest  to  its 
cause. 

There  is  great  variation  between  the  ebb  and  flow  of  the  sea  in  the 
vicinity  of  those  places  at  which  the  springs  of  the  waters  depart  from 
the  depths  of  the  seas  in  order  to  supply  a  perpetual  stream  of  water 
to  the  rivers  which  afterwards  descend  from  the  high  mountains. 

These  springs  are  of  two  natures,  of  which  one  is  of  those  that  are 


346  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

continually  discharging  themselves  in  the  rivers;  and  there  are  others 
that  pour  themselves  into  the  sea,  and  rise  fresh  above  the  other  salt 
waters:  which  thing  proceeds  from  the  fact  of  them  being  born  from 
the  lakes  that  lie  open  to  the  air,  which  are  higher  than  the  waters  of 
the  sea,  otherwise  this  rising  would  not  take  place.  And  yet  one  might 
say  that  just  as  the  springs  of  the  mountains  are  poured  to  their  feet, 
so  such  springs  might  also  be  poured  beneath  the  sea. 

There  is  a  spring  in  Sicily  which  as  it  rises  at  certain  seasons  of  the 
year  throws  out  chestnut  leaves  in  large  quantities.  Since  however 
chestnut  trees  do  not  grow  in  Sicily  this  spring  must  have  come  orig- 
inally from  some  underground  lake  in  Italy  and  then  passed  beneath 
the  sea  and  afterward  found  outlet  in  Sicily.1 

In  the  Bosphorus  the  Black  Sea  always  flows  into  the  Aegean,  never 
the  Aegean  into  it.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  Caspian  Sea,  five 
hundred  miles  to  the  east,  together  with  the  rivers  that  flow  into  it,  is 
always  discharging  itself  through  subterranean  channels  into  the  Black 
Sea;  and  the  Don  and  also  the  Danube  do  the  same;  so  that  as  a  con- 
sequence the  waters  of  the  Black  Sea  are  always  higher  than  those  of 
the  Aegean,  and  it  follows  that  the  higher  always  descend  into  the 
lower  and  never  the  lower  into  the  higher. 

Some  say  that  the  waters  which  rise  in  the  summits  of  the  high 
mountains,  are  part  of  the  water  of  the  sea  which  is  higher  than  the 
summits  of  the  highest  mountains  that  exist;  which  serves  them  to 
prove  that  the  surface  of  the  sea  is  lower  than  any  part  of  the  earth 
that  stands  above  the  waters,  or  that  any  part  of  the  surface  of  a  river 
which  flows  into  this  sea. 

Others  say  that  the  waters  which  flow  above  the  high  summits  of 
the  mountains  are  descended  from  the  higher  mountains  of  the 
world  which  are  covered  with  snow  that  melts  during  the  summer. 
But  this  opinion  is  shown  to  be  incorrect,  for  if  it  were  the  case  that 
the  melting  snows  of  summer  entering  into  subterranean  caverns  and 
through  the  springs  in  the  ground  had  sent  the  water  in  the  tops  of 
the  mountains  lower  than  the  mouths  of  the  springs,  there  would  be

Leonardo  may  have  written  'Cicilia'  in  mistake  for  Cilicia. 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  347 

more  water  in  these  springs  in  summer  than  in  winter,  but  experience 
shows  that  the  opposite  is  the  case. 

All  the  outlets  of  the  waters  which  proceed  from  the  mountain  to 
the  sea  carry  stones  from  the  mountains  with  them  to  the  sea;  and  by 
the  backwash  of  the  ocean  surges  against  their  mountains  these  stones 
were  thrown  back  towards  the  mountain;  and  as  the  waters  moved 
towards  the  sea  and  returned  from  it  the  stones  turned  with  them,  and 
as  they  were  rolled  back  their  corners  struck  together,  and  such  parts 
of  them  as  offered  least  resistance  to  the  blow  were  worn  away  and 
make  stones  without  angles  of  a  round  shape,  such  as  are  to  be  seen 
on  the  shores  of  Elba.  And  those  remain  bigger  which  are  carried  the 
least  distance  from  their  native  spot,  and  in  like  manner  the  stone  be- 
comes smaller  which  is  transported  farther  away  from  the  aforesaid 
spot,  for  in  the  course  of  its  progress  it  becomes  changed  to  fine 
shingle  and  then  to  sand  and  finally  to  mud.  After  the  sea  had  receded 
from  the  aforesaid  mountains  the  salt  deposit  which  it  left  behind 
with  the  other  moisture  from  the  earth  formed  a  compound  with  the 
shingle  and  sand  so  that  the  shingle  became  changed  to  rock  and  the 
sand  to  tufa. 

And  of  this  we  may  see  an  example  in  the  Adda  where  it  emerges 
from  the  mountains  of  Como,  and  in  the  Ticino  the  Adige  the  Oglio 
and  the  Adriano  from  the  Austrian  Alps;  and  in  the  same  way  with 
the  Arno  from  Monte  Albano  round  about  Monte  Lupo  and  Capraia, 
where  the  largest  rocks  are  all  formed  of  solidified  shingle  of  different 
varieties  of  stone  and  of  different  colours. 

That  thing  which  is  lighter  will  be  carried  farther  by  the  rivers  from 
the  place  whence  its  waters  snatched  it  away;  and  so  that  which  is 
heavier  will  be  removed  a  less  distance  from  the  place  at  which  it  was 
separated.  That  percussion  of  the  water  carries  away  more  of  the  bank 
of  rivers  which  strikes  this  bank  at  more  equal  angles;  and  so  con- 
versely it  will  carry  away  less  when  the  angles  are  more  unequal. 

Leic.  31  v. 

There  are  as  many  differences  in  the  resistance  made  by  water  be- 
neath that  which  is  supported  by  it  as  there  are  differences  in  its  heat 
or  cold. 

Given  two  rivers  of  equal  volume  of  water  at  their  entrances,  their 


348  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

exits  will  be  equal;  that  is,  given  an  equal  volume  of  water  in  an  equal 
time,  even  though  the  rivers  may  vary  in  length,  breadth,  slant  and 
depth  and  the  one  be  twisted  and  the  other  straight;  or  though  both 
be  twisted  but  the  shapes  of  their  curves  are  unlike;  or  one  be  of  uni- 
form breadth  and  the  other  of  varying  breadth;  and  if  both  vary  their 
variation  may  be  different ;  one  may  be  of  uniform  depth  and  the 
other  of  varying  depth;  and  should  both  depths  vary  in  themselves 
their  variation  may  not  have  any  kind  of  likeness;  and  the  whole  of 
one  may  be  uniformly  swift  and  the  other  uniformly  slow,  or  the 
slowness  and  swiftness  of  one  may  be  mixed,  that  is  where  it  runs  and 
where  it  lingers,  where  the  waters  fall  perpendicularly  and  where  they 
rise  in  a  swirling  flood;  and  the  fact  that  there  exist  in  these  two  rivers 
infinite  varieties  of  currents  in  breadth,  length,  slant  and  depth  will  not 
therefore  prevent  the  equal  entrance  of  the  one  from  being  equal  to  its 
exit,  and  the  equal  entrances  of  the  one  and  the  other  from  being  equal 
in  their  exits. 

If  the  Mediterranean  Sea  departs  from  its  site  it  raises  the  sphere  of 
the  water  and  occupies  new  valleys,  and  consequently  the  centre  of 
gravity  of  this  increase  will  be  round  the  antipodes;  and  so  on  that  side 
the  weight  grows,  and  on  this  there  is  lacking  the  whole  amount  of 
the  weight  of  the  water  that  has  departed  from  there;  and  although 
this  position  may  be  filled  up  by  that  earth  which  was  carried  by  the 
rivers  into  this  Mediterranean,  the  centre  of  its  gravity  will  be  oppo- 
site to  that  of  the  sphere  which  has  been  increased  in  the  antipodes; 
and  so  on  this  side  the  weight  is  not  increased  by  the  earth  which  has 
been  removed  as  a  substitute  for  the  sea  which  has  been  expelled,  be- 
cause this  earth  remains  in  our  hemisphere,  that  is,  the  centre  of  its 
gravity,  but  it  is  nevertheless  true  that  the  whole  weight  of  the  water 
is  here  diminished.  Therefore  the  centre  of  the  world  will  become 
nearer  to  our  antipodes,  lightening  itself  here  of  the  weight  of  the 
water  which  has  departed;  and  the  summits  of  the  mountains  will 
raise  themselves  more  from  this  centre:  until  such  a  point  that  the 
rivers  which  accompany  the  Nile  after  much  rambling  about  through 
the  great  plain  into  which  the  Mediterranean  is  divided  will  carry 
through  the  straits  of  Gibraltar  all  the  part  of  the  soil  that  makes  it 
turbid;  and  in  the  course  of  time  they  will  place  as  much  soil  in  the 
ocean  bevond  the  straits  of  Gibraltar  as  is  found  between  Libya  and 


PHYSICAL  G  EOGRAPHY  349 

the  sea,  and  between  the  Alps  and  the  said  sea;  and  so  again  the  centre 

of  the  world  will  become  nearer  die  centre  of  the  weight  increased  to 
the  ocean,  and  the  parts  lightened  will  become  more  remote  from  this 
eentre.  So  then  it  is  concluded  that  the  more  the  soil  is  removed  from 
US  the  more  it  lightens  our  regions;  as  a  consequence  the  more  it  is 
removed  from  the  centre  of  the  earth  the  more  the  waters  consume  it 
and  the  more  again  it  becomes  light;  and  so  it  will  continue  until 
all  the  earth  laid  bare  is  carried  to  the  sea  by  the  Nile  or  by  the  rivers 
that  are  poured  into  it. 

And  so  the  earth  that  is  found  in  the  rivers  that  now  pour  them- 
selves into  the  Mediterranean  will  be  carried  by  the  Nile  together 
with  the  turbid  water  that  remains  in  it  to  the  ocean. 

So  then  the  sea  will  return  to  cover  the  places  where  were  formerly 
the  roots  and  bases  of  the  mountains,  and  it  will  cover  the  earth. 

It  is  not  denied  that  the  Nile  is  always  turbid  as  it  enters  the  Egyp- 
tian sea,  and  that  this  turbid  condition  is  due  to  the  soil  which  this 
river  carries  away  continually  from  the  places  through  which  it  passes, 
and  this  soil  never  returns  back  nor  does  the  sea  receive  it  except  just 
to  cast  it  back  upon  its  shores;  behold  the  ocean  of  sand  beyond 
Mount  Atlas  where  it  was  once  covered  with  salt  water. 

The  water  that  is  found  in  the  highest  mountains  is  not  there  be- 
cause it  has  been  drawn  there  by  the  heat  of  the  sun  for  but  little  of 
this  heat  passes  downwards,  as  is  seen  below  La  Vernia,  where  the 
power  of  the  sun  is  not  sufficient  to  melt  the  ice  during  the  greatest 
heat  of  summer,  but  it  remains  there  in  the  hollows  in  which  it  has 
been  lying  since  the  winter.  And  on  the  northern  slopes  of  the  Alps, 
where  the  sun  does  not  strike,  the  ice  never  melts,  because  the  heat  of 
the  sun  cannot  penetrate  the  small  thickness  of  the  mountains;  still 
less  therefore  will  the  vast  space  that  lies  between  the  summits  of  the 
great  mountains  and  the  depths  of  the  watery  sphere  be  penetrated  by 
this  heat  of  the  sun  which  would  have  to  pass  beneath  the  base  of  this 
mountain.  If  you  should  say  that  the  earth's  action  is  like  that  of  a 
sponge  which  when  part  of  it  is  placed  in  water  sucks  up  the  water  so 
that  it  passes  up  to  the  top  of  the  sponge,  the  answer  is  that  even  if 
the  water  itself  rises  to  the  top  of  the  sponge,  it  cannot  then  pour 
away  any  part  of  itself  down  from  this  top,  unless  it  is  squeezed  by 


350  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

something  else,  whereas  with  the  summits  of  the  mountains  one  sees  ir 
is  just  the  opposite,  for  there  the  water  always  flows  away  of  its  own 
accord  without  being  squeezed  by  anything. 

Perhaps  you  will  say  that  water  can  only  rise  the  same  distance  as  it 
descends;  and  that  the  surface  of  the  sea  is  higher  than  the  summits 
of  the  highest  mountains.  The  answer  to  this  is  that  the  exact  opposite 
is  the  case,  for  the  lowest  part  visible  to  the  sky  is  the  surface  of  the 
sea,  since  water  does  not  move  of  itself  unless  to  descend,  and  so  de- 
scends when  it  moves;  as  therefore  the  rivers  which  stretch  from  the 
summits  of  the  mountains  to  the  sea  are  everywhere  in  movement 
they  are  therefore  everywhere  descending,  and  when  they  come  to  the 
sea  they  stop  and  end  their  movement;  for  which  reason  one  must  con- 
clude that  they  are  stationary  in  the  lowest  reaches  of  the  river.  But 
if  you  should  say  that  the  farther  the  sea  is  away  from  the  shore  the 
more  it  rises  up  and  so  it  comes  to  equal  the  height  of  the  high  moun- 
tains; it  is  shown  here  that  a  thing  is  higher  which  is  farther  removed 
from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  and  if  the  element  of  water  is  spherical 
the  definition  of  spherical  bodies  is  those  in  which  every  part  of  the 
surface  is  equidistant  from  the  centre.  So  therefore  the  shore  of  the  sea 
is  as  high  as  its  centre,  and  whatever  may  be  discerned  from  the  shore 
is  higher  than  any  part  of  the  sea;  and  the  distance  that  there  is  from 
the  summits  of  the  high  mountains  to  the  centre  of  the  earth  is  greater 
than  the  distance  from  this  centre  to  the  sea  shore:  this  then  is  our 
conclusion. 

And  if  you  should  say  as  has  been  said  that  the  sun  sucks  up  and 
draws  the  waters  from  the  roots  of  the  mountains  to  their  summits, 
then  as  the  heat  draws  the  moisture  to  itself  the  heat  which  is  more 
powerful  would  draw  to  itself  a  greater  amount  of  water  than  the  less 
powerful.  In  summer  therefore  during  the  fiery  heats  the  springs  of 
the  waters  would  have  to  rise  higher  into  the  summits  of  the  moun- 
tains than  they  do  in  winter;  but  we  see  it  is  the  contrary  seeing  that 
in  summer  the  rivers  lack  a  great  part  of  their  waters.        Eeic.  32  v. 

OF  THE  ORIGIN  OF  RIVERS 

The  body  of  the  earth  like  the  bodies  of  animals  is  interwoven  with 
a  network  of  veins  which  are  all  joined  together,  and  are  formed  for 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  351 

:he  nutrition  and  vivifying  of  this  earth  and  of  its  creatures;  and  they 
originate  in  the  depths  of  the  sea,  and  there  after  many  revolutions 
they  have  to  return  through  the  rivers  formed  by  the  high  burstings 
of  these  veins.  And  if  you  should  wish  to  say  that  rains  in  winter  or 
the  melting  of  the  snow  in  summer  were  the  cause  of  the  origin  of 
the  rivers,  one  may  offer  as  an  instance  the  rivers  which  originate  in 
the  torrid  regions  of  Africa  in  which  it  does  not  rain  still  less  does  it 
snow,  because  the  excessive  heat  always  dissolves  into  air  all  the  clouds 
which  are  driven  there  by  the  winds.  And  if  you  should  say  that  these 
rivers  which  become  big  in  July  and  August  are  from  the  snow  which 
melts  in  May  and  June  as  the  sun  approaches  nearer  to  the  snowfields 
of  the  mountains  of  Scythia,  and  that  the  snow  thus  melted  collects 
in  certain  valleys  and  forms  lakes,  into  which  it  enters  by  springs  and 
underground  caverns,  afterwards  emerging  to  form  the  source  of  the 
Nile,  this  is  incorrect  because  Scythia  lies  below  the  source  of  the  Nile, 
and  Scythia  moreover  is  only  four  hundred  miles  from  the  Black  Sea 
whereas  the  source  of  the  Nile  is  a  distance  of  three  thousand  miles 
from  the  Egyptian  sea  into  which  it  pours  its  water.  Leic.  33  v. 

In  the  western  parts  near  to  Flanders  the  sea  rises  and  falls  about 
twenty  braccia  every  six  hours;  and  twenty-two  when  the  moon  is 
favourable;  but  twenty  braccia  is  its  usual  variation  and  this  as  is 
clearly  seen  is  not  caused  by  the  moon.  This  variation  in  the  rising 
and  falling  of  the  sea  every  six  hours  may  occur  through  the  swelling 
up  of  the  waters  which  are  poured  into  the  Mediterranean  by  the 
number  of  the  rivers  from  Africa  Asia  and  Europe  that  pour  their 
waters  into  this  sea;  and  this  gives  back  to  the  ocean  through  the 
straits  of  Gibraltar  between  the  promontories  Abyla  and  Calpe  the 
waters  given  to  it  by  these  rivers. 

This  ocean  as  it  extends  between  the  island  of  England  and  other 
islands  farther  north,  comes  to  swell  up  and  form  a  bore  at  the  mouths 
of  certain  gulfs,  which,  being  as  it  were  seas,  with  the  surface  separated 
from  that  of  the  central  body  of  the  earth,  have  acquired  weight,  and 
this,  as  it  exceeds  the  force  of  the  incoming  waters  that  occasioned  it, 
causes  this  water  to  take  again  an  impetus  contrary  to  that  of  its  ap- 
proach, and  so  creates  an  impetus  contrary  to  that  which  the  waters 
have  given  the  straits,  and  especially  against  the  straits  of  Gibraltar, 
which  for  as  long  as  this  is  going  on  remain  in  swirling  flood,  holding 


352  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

hack  all  the  water  recently  given  them  at  that  time  by  the  aforesaid 
rivers;  and  this  would  seem  to  be  one  of  the  reasons  which  may  be 
assigned  for  this  ebb  and  flow;  as  is  proved  in  the  twenty-first  of  the 
fourth  of  my  book  on  Theory.  This  would  occur  when  the  water  that 
formed  the  springs  of  rivers  was  caused  by  rain  or  melting  snow.  But 
if  these  springs  had  their  origin  in  the  depths  of  the  sea  this  reason 
would  not  exist,  for  at  their  beginning  the  sea  would  give  them  as 
much  water  as  the  rivers  gave  the  sea,  namely  what  they  received 
from  the  ends  of  their  springs;  and  so  for  this  cause  the  sea  would 
not  increase  or  grow  less. 

The  stratified  rocks  are  created  in  the  vast  depths  of  the  seas  because 
the  mud  which  the  storms  detach  from  the  sea  coasts  is  carried  out  to 
the  deep  sea  by  the  recoil  of  the  waves;  and  after  these  storms  it  is 
deposited  upon  the  bottom  of  the  sea,  and  as  no  storm  can  penetrate 
the  sea  on  account  of  the  great  distance  that  it  is  below  the  surface  it 
lies  there  motionless  and  becomes  petrified;  and  sometimes  it  remains 
in  the  form  of  white  clay  which  serves  for  making  pots;  and  thus  with 
blocks  set  at  different  angles  it  is  made  up  of  layers  of  as  many  differ- 
ent thicknesses  as  are  the  differences  in  the  storms  whether  greater 
or  less.  Leic.  35  r. 


WHETHER  THE  EARTH  IS  LESS  THAN  THE  WATER 

Some  assert  as  a  fact  that  the  earth  which  is  not  covered  by  the 
waters  is  much  less  than  that  which  is  covered  by  them;  but  since  the 
size  of  the  diameter  of  the  earth  is  seven  thousand  miles,  it  may  be 
concluded  that  as  the  water  is  almost  universally  of  but  little  depth  its 
weight  bears  no  comparison  to  that  of  the  earth.  The  answer  to  these 
is  that  the  water  which  is  poured  into  the  atmosphere  which  becomes 
united  as  it  rises  to  the  cold  region  of  the  atmosphere  is  very  heavy 
in  weight  and  falls  in  great  deluges  and  floods.  And  how  do  we  know 
whether  the  earth  has  enormous  caverns  with  reservoirs  of  water? 

And  the  innumerable  springs  which  are  fed  by  as  many  streams  of 
water,  as  are  seen  in  the  formation  of  the  rivers?  Take  as  an  instance 
the  Caspian  Sea  which  is  very  great. 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  353 

Always  the  centre  of  the  sphere  of  the  water,  but  not  of  its  weight, 
because  it  is  DOt  of  equal  thickness  spread  over  the  earth,  will  he  con- 
centric with  the  centre  of  the  world;  and  it  is  the  same  as  regards  the 
centre  of  the  gravity  of  the  earth  and  of  the  waters  joined  together, 
but  not  of  its  gravity  nor  of  its  magnitude;  and  if  the  earth  of  itselt 
were  spherical  and  without  water  within  itself,  then  the  water  would 
clothe  it  with  uniform  size  and  weight;  and  so  the  centre  of  the  world 
would  remain  centre  of  the  sphere  and  magnitude  of  the  water  and 
of  its  weight;  and  so  it  would  remain  centre  of  the  sphere  and  magni- 
tude of  the  earth,  and  centre  of  its  gravity;  consequently  as  the  earth  is 
mixed  and  full  of  the  ramifications  of  the  waters  within  itself,  is  in 
some  parts  spread  out  in  some  compact,  in  some  soil,  in  some  rock, 
this  earth  has  not  in  itself  a  centre  of  sphericity  or  a  centre  of  gravity, 
and  this  especially  through  it  having  water  and  earth  above  the  sphere 
of  the  water,  which  give  weight  to  it  as  though  it  was  the  weight  of 
the  earth. 

Consequently  by  this  one  concludes  that  the  gravity  of  the  earth  and 
the  water  joined  and  mingled  together  have  usually  their  centre  con- 
centric with  the  centre  of  the  world,  which  centre  is  also  the  centre  of 
the  spherical  surface  of  the  water,  and  not  of  its  weight,  as  I  have  said 
above;  and  this  surface  of  the  sphere  of  the  water  is  broken  and  di- 
vided by  the  earth  which  borders  on  the  air. 

If  the  earth  were  entirely  submerged  by  the  water,  even  though  it 
was  of  varied  and  irregular  shape  it  would  have  the  centre  of  its 
natural  gravity  concentric  with  the  centre  of  the  world  and  of  the 
surface  of  the  sphere  of  water,  but  not  with  the  centre  of  its  natural  or 
even  of  its  accidental  gravity. 

That  earth  which  is  not  covered  by  the  waters  will  be  much  heavier 
than  that  which  is  beneath  this  water. 

The  centres  of  the  heavy  bodies  are  three  and  they  are  differently 
situated,  seeing  that  sometimes  they  are  joined  together;  and  here 
accidental  gravity  dies;  sometimes  there  are  two  together  and  the  third 
is  separated  from  them;  and  here  accidental  gravity  arises;  and  some- 
times they  are  placed  together  in  three  different  positions,  the  one 
from  the  other :  and  the  first  is  the  centre  of  the  magnitude,  the  second 
is  the  centre  of  its  natural  gravity,  and  the  third  the  centre  of  the 
accidental  gravity. 


354  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

The  centre  of  the  magnitude  is  that  which  is  separated  equally  from 
the  opposite  extremities  of  the  body  that  encloses  it  whether  it  be 
uniform  or  not;  and  it  is  sufficient  that  it  is  situated  at  an  equal  dis- 
tance from  the  opposite  extremities  of  a  staff,  as  of  a  cloth  of  any 
material.  And  these  are  joined  together  in  a  body  of  perfect  sphericity 
and  uniform  substance  and  density,  because  here  there  are  only  two 
and  they  are  concentric. 

Necessity  makes  the  machine  of  the  earth  empty  of  earth  and  full 
of  water,  after  the  fashion  of  a  vessel  filled  with  water: 

This  is  confirmed  by  the  tenfold  proportion  which  the  four  elements 
have  between  them,  which  is  seen  of  the  air  with  the  earth  of  which 
the  proportion  is  a  hundredfold,  because  the  thickness  of  the  air  has 
been  measured  between  the  comet  which  is  in  the  uppermost  part  of 
the  air  and  with  the  surface  of  the  sphere  of  the  water  which  is  in 
the  lowest  part  of  the  sphere  of  the  air.  Now  the  water  may  be  said 
to  have  as  much  earth  uncovered  which  projects  above  the  surface  of 
the  sphere  of  the  water,  as  that  which  is  lacking  from  the  surface  of 
the  water  towards  the  centre  of  the  world,  that  is,  I  consider  that  the 
highest  mountain  that  there  is  in  the  earth  is  as  far  above  the  surface 
of  the  sphere  of  the  water  as  the  greatest  depth  of  the  sea  is  below  this 
surface  of  the  sea.  It  follows  that  if  one  were  to  fill  up  the  part  want- 
ing in  the  sea  with  the  excess  of  the  earth,  that  this  earth  would  re- 
main spherical  and  entirely  covered  by  the  sphere  of  the  water.  But,  so 
far  as  one  can  discern,  this  sphere  of  water,  or  you  may  say  element, 
would  not  be  ten  times  as  great  as  the  sphere  of  the  earth,  but  far  from 
being  ten  times  it  would  not  attain  to  the  relation  of  equality,  because 
one  sees  clearly  that  the  sphere  of  the  water  would  not  rise  a  mile 
above  the  sphere  of  the  water,  that  is  it  would  not  raise  itself  to  the 
altitude  of  the  highest  mountain;  which  thing  however  would  take 
place  when  all  the  earth  uncovered  was  everywhere  as  high  as  this 
highest  mountain. 

Therefore  it  is  concluded  that  the  remainder  of  this  water  stays  in 
the  body  and  springs  of  the  earth,  in  which  it  may  have  fallen  over  a 
wide  area,  and  lightened  the  spot  from  whence  it  separated  itself,  as  is 
represented  opposite  in  B. 

In  two  ways  the  gravity  of  the  earth  can  have  its  centre  concentric 
with  the  centre  of  the  world,  that  is  if  it  is  either  altogether  submerged 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  355 

by   the   waters  or  has  its  opposite  side  out  of  the   waters   of  equal 
weight. 

The  centre  of  the  gravity  of  the  water  and  of  the  earth  might  he- 
concentric  with  the  centre  of  the  world  if  the  earth  were  perfectly 
spherical.  The  centre  of  the  world  would  then  be  the  centre  of  the 
sphere  of  the  earth,  as  of  the  sphere  of  the  water.  But  it  would  not 
produce  land  animals.  Leic.  35  v. 

OF  THE  EARTH  IN  ITSELF 

The  fact  of  the  summits  of  the  mountains  projecting  so  far  above  the 
watery  sphere  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  a  very  large  space  of  the 
earth  which  was  filled  with  water,  that  is  the  immense  cavern,  must 
have  fallen  in  a  considerable  distance  from  its  vault  towards  the  centre 
of  the  world,  finding  itself  pierced  by  the  course  of  the  springs,  which 
continually  wear  away  the  spot  through  which  they  pass,  having  in 
them  some  of  the  air  above;  because  water  has  no  weight  unless  it 
sends  a  wave  out  of  its  level  through  the  air,  and  it  is  this  wave  alone 
that  has  weight  and  falls  and  wears  away  the  base.  Now  this  great 
mass  has  the  power  of  falling,  being  the  centre  of  the  world  within 
the  water:  it  balances  itself  with  equal  opposing  weights  round  the 
centre  of  the  world,  and  lightens  the  earth  from  which  it  is  divided; 
and  it  removed  itself  immediately  from  the  centre  of  the  world  and 
rose  to  the  height,  for  so  one  sees  the  layers  of  the  rocks,  formed  by 
the  changes  which  the  water  has  undergone,  at  the  summits  of  the 
high  mountains. 

Subsidence  of  lands,  as  in  the  Dead  Sea  in  Syria,  to  wit  Sodom  and 
Gomorrah. 

It  must  needs  be  that  the  water  is  more  than  the  land;  and  the  part 
uncovered  by  the  sea  does  not  reveal  it;  it  must  needs  be  therefore  that 
there  is  a  great  mass  of  water  within  the  earth,  in  addition  to  that 
which  is  diffused  through  the  lower  parts  of  the  atmosphere  and  runs 
through  the  rivers  and  springs. 

I  say  that  it  is  not  necessary  that  the  centre  of  the  world  be  situated 
more  in  the  earth  than  in  the  water,  because  the  gravity  of  the  earth 
and  of  the  water,  joined  together  in  any  manner  whatever,  rests  with 


356  PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY 

weights  of  gravity  situated  oppositely  around  the  centre  of  the  world; 
and  the  earth  does  not  expect  to  have  parts  of  itself  equally  distant 
from  this  centre,  but  weights  equally  heavy  placed  opposite;  and  in 
this  case  the  water  being  mingled  with  various  ramifications  of  springs 
together  with  the  earth,  cannot  give  of  itself  weights  equally  distant 
from  this  centre,  but  will  have  a  surface  equidistant  from  this  centre. 

Now  if  it  is  as  has  been  said,  it  is  possible,  the  centre  of  the  world 
being  situated  in  the  water,  that  on  some  occasion,  through  the  con- 
stant friction  that  the  water  has  through  the  springs  through  which 
it  passes,  it  may  have  so  widened  these  springs  that  the  part  of  the 
earth  which  is  interposed  between  these  springs,  exhausting  the  tenacity 
of  the  remainder,  [brings  it  about]  that  the  gravity,  which  it  has  ac- 
quired through  being  above  the  water,  has  detached  itself  from  this 
remainder  and  has  fallen  towards  the  centre  and  made  this  concentric 
with  the  centre  of  its  gravity.  And  through  this  the  remainder  of  the 
earth  having  made  itself  lighter  by  that  part  from  whence  the  said 
gravity  fell,  will  of  necessity  remove  itself  from  the  centre  of  the 
world,  and  the  earth  and  the  mountains  will  emerge  out  of  the  sphere 
of  the  water  lightened  by  this  part,  and  will  also  make  itself  lighter  by 
the  weight  of  the  water  which  rested  upon  it,  and  will  come  so  much 
the  more  to  raise  itself  towards  the  sky.  And  the  sphere  of  the  water 
in  this  case  does  not  change  its  position,  because  its  water  fills  up  the 
place  from  which  the  gravity  of  that  part  of  the  earth  that  fell  divided 
itself;  and  thus  the  sea  remains  in  itself  without  change  of  height. 
And  this  may  also  be  the  reason  why  the  marine  shells  and  oysters 
that  are  seen  in  the  high  mountains,  which  have  formerly  been  beneath 
the  salt  waters,  are  now  found  at  so  great  a  height,  together  with  the 
stratified  rocks,  once  formed  of  layers  of  mud  carried  by  the  rivers  in 
the  lakes  swamps  and  seas;  and  in  this  process  there  is  nothing  that  is 
contrary  to  reason. 

Given  a  perfectly  smooth  surface  the  water  will  not  rest  upon  it: 
given  a  spherical  surface  the  water  will  instantly  rest  there:  which 
sphericity  will  be  the  sphere  of  the  water. 

The  strata  or  layers  of  stone  do  not  continue  to  any  great  distance 
underneath  the  roots  of  the  mountains  because  they  are  made  of  earth 
that  is  used  for  making  vessels  and  is  full  of  shells;  and  also  these  go 
only  a  short  distance  below  because  one  finds  the  ordinary  earth  there, 


PHYSICAL  GEOGRAPHY  357 

as  is  seen  in  the  rivers  whieh  flow  through  the  Marches  and  the  Ro- 
magna,  after  they  have  issued  from  the  Apennines. 

You  have  now  to  prove  how  the  shells  are  not  produced  except  in 
salt  waters,  and  that  this  is  the  case  with  almost  all  kinds;  and  how 
the  shells  of  Lomhardy  are  found  at  four  levels.  And  so  it  is  with  all 
which  are  made  at  difTerent  periods  of  time;  and  these  are  found  in  all 
the  valleys  that  open  out  into  the  seas.  Leic.  36  r.

[Drawing  a  b] 

Here  the  two  streams  of  the  waters  clash  together  in  the  line  a  b, 
and  in  such  percussion  they  make  a  complete  circle,  one  with  another, 
striking  from  the  surface  to  the  base. 

And  this  revolving  mass  after  being  formed  is  driven  away  from  the 
position  where  it  was  created  by  the  rush  of  the  waters  coming  above 
it;  and  in  such  a  change  this  revolving  mass  has  acquired  two  move- 
ments, that  is  the  natural  movement  round  its  centre  and  secondly  that 
which  it  acquires  from  one  place  to  another.  This  therefore  will  be  a 
direct  revolving  movement,  which  when  it  occurs  in  the  water  or  amid

impel  the  revolving  movements  towards  the  hank  of  the  less  powerful 
stream,  which  as  it  burrows  down  with  its  two  sets  of  movements, 
namely  the  straight  and  the  revolving,  goes  hollowing  out  the  base-  oi 
the  banks,  and  the  upper  parts  which  were  upheld  by  these  falling 
headlong  as  their  foundations  crumble,  are  worn  away  anew  by  this 
eddying  movement. 

When  the  streams  of  the  waters  are  unequal  these  waters  as  they 
meet  go  ranging  round,  the  less  powerful  stream  entering  with  the 
branches  of  its  lower  eddies  underneath  those  of  the  upper  eddies 
which  are  made  by  the  more  powerful  stream. 

When  the  water  of  greater  power  strikes  the  water  of  less  power  the 
line  of  eddies  describes  a  curve,  entering  in  convex  form  into  the  body 
of  the  water  of  greater  power. 

When  the  curving  line  of  the  eddies  enters  in  its  convexity  within 
the  water  of  less  power  this  water  remains  within  its  limits  without 
moving;  at  this  stage  it  swells  up  and  raises  itself  and  acquires  gravity, 
and  so  from  the  weight  that  it  has  acquired  it  multiplies  in  power  and 
makes  headway  against  the  water  which  at  first  overcame  it,  so  that  the 
line  of  eddies  is  curved  in  a  contrary  direction  and  becomes  concave 
where  it  was  formerly  convex,  and  thus  the  lesser  water  is  often  driven 
by  the  greater  and  the  greater  by  the  lesser,  but  the  lesser  is  driven 
farther  in  proportion  as  it  is  of  less  power.1  c.a.  77  r.  b

high  which  are  very  fine  to  see,  and  you  may  find  good  living  at  four

which  rises  and  falls  every  six  hours,  and  as  it  rises  it  supplies  two  mills 
with  water  and  there  is  a  surplus,  and  as  it  falls  it  causes  the  spring  to 
dry  up  for  a  distance  of  more  than  two  miles.  It  is  in  this  district  that  a 
river  falls  with  a  great  impetus  through  a  mighty  chasm  in  the  moun- 
tain. These  journeys  should  be  made  in  the  month  of  May,  and  the 
largest  bare  rocks  which  exist  in  these  parts  are  the  mountains  of 
Mandello  near  to  those  of  Lecco  and  Gravidonia;  towards  Bellinzona 
thirty  miles  from  Lecco  are  those  of  the  valley  of  Chiavenna;  but  the 
greatest  is  that  of  Mandello,  which  has  at  its  base  a  gully  towards  the 
lake  that  descends  two  hundred  steps,  and  here  at  all  seasons  there  is 
ice  and  wind.

In  Val  Sasina  between  Vimognio  and  Introbbio  on  the  right  hand 
where  you  enter  the  road  to  Lecco  you  come  upon  the  Trosa,  a  river 
which  falls  from  a  very  high  rock  and  as  it  falls  goes  underground  and 
so  the  river  ends  there.  Three  miles  farther  on  you  come  to  the  build-

San  Pietro,  and  the  iron  mines,  and  various  strange  things.  La  Grignia

TOPOGRAPHICAL  NOTES  363 

WHY  THE  CURRENT  FROM  SPAIN  IS  ALWAYS  GREATER 
TOWARDS  THE  EAST  THAN  TOWARDS  THE  WEST 

The  reason  is  that  if  you  were  to  place  together  the  mouths  of  the 
rivers  which  come  into  this  Mediterranean  sea  you  would  find  that 
there  was  a  greater  volume  of  water  than  that  which  this  sea  pours 
through  the  straits  into  the  ocean.  You  see  that  Africa  discharges  into 
this  sea  such  of  its  rivers  as  flow  to  the  north,  among  these  being  the 
Nile  which  waters  three  thousand  miles  of  Africa,  the  river  Bragada, 
the  Mauretanus  and  others  like  these.  Europe  pours  there  the  Don  and 
the  Danube,  the  Po  and  the  Rhone,  the  Arno  and  the  Tiber.  It  is  clear 
therefore  that  these  rivers  together  with  an  infinite  number  of  lesser- 
known  rivers  make  up  a  greater  breadth  depth  and  current  than  are 
found  in  the  eighteen  miles  of  ocean  straits  which  divide  Europe  from 
Africa  at  their  western  extremities.  And  if  you  should  wish  to  say  that 
the  rivers  which  empty  themselves  into  the  ocean  act  differently,  it  is 
certain  that  the  aforesaid  rivers  almost  all  have  their  origin  in  moun- 
tains near  to  this  ocean,  and  if  these  mountains  were  to  empty  them 
there  there  would  be  no  river  in  the  vicinity  of  as  great  current  as  the 
Nile  and  the  Danube,  and  if  moreover  there  were  a  resemblance,  con- 
sider that  these  rivers,  in  emptying  themselves  into  the  ocean,  can  give 
it  but  little  increase  so  as  to  restore  the  current  towards  the  east,  unless 
it  always  is  that  the  clouds  contain  a  greater  volume  than  that  which 
the  rivers  place  there,  and  these  clouds  becoming  constricted  compress 
the  air  with  swift  movement  within  the  other  air,  like  a  hand  which 
squeezes  a  sponge  with  water  amid  the  other  water,  so  that  that  which 
flies  away  gives  place  to  the  rest. 

Water  moves  within  water  with  the  same  facility  as  air  moves  within 
air  although  it  is  more  .  .  .  [t  .  .  .]   [?]  as  is  seen  in  its  circles. 

Current  only  exists  in  the  seas  which  communicate  with  the  ocean; 
the  Caspian  sea  and  the  swamps  have  no  current;  while  the  Indian 
Ocean  flows  eastwards  the  western  Mediterranean  flows  westward.

OF  THE  CONSUMPTION  OR  EVAPORATION  OF  THE 
WATER  OF  THE  MEDITERRANEAN  SEA 

The  Mediterranean  Sea  a  vast  river  interposed  between  Africa  Asia 
and  Europe  gathers  within  itself  about  three  hundred  principal  rivers, 
and  in  addition  to  these  it  receives  the  rains  which  fall  upon  it  over 
a  space  of  three  thousand  miles.  It  gives  back  to  the  mighty  ocean  its 
own  waters  and  the  others  that  it  has  received,  and  without  doubt  it 
gives  less  back  to  the  sea  than  those  it  receives;  for  from  it  descend 
many  springs  which  flow  through  the  bowels  of  the  earth  and  vivify 
this  terrestrial  machine.  This  is  necessary  by  reason  of  the  fact  that  the 
surface  of  this  Mediterranean  is  more  remote  from  the  centre  of  the 
world  than  the  surface  of  this  ocean,  as  is  proved  by  my  second  [rule]; 
and  in  addition  to  this  the  heat  of  the  sun  is  continually  evaporating  a 
portion  of  the  water  of  the  Mediterranean,  and  as  a  consequence  this 
sea  can  acquire  but  little  increase  from  the  aforesaid  rains,  and  is  but 
little  diminished  through  the  water  that  has  been  added  to  it  being 
poured  into  the  ocean,  or  from  it  being  evaporated  by  the  heat  of  the 
sun  or  the  course  of  the  parching  winds.  c.a.  263  v.  b 

The  watery  sphere  desires  perfect  roundness,  and  that  part  which 
projects  above  its  general  surface  cannot  continue,  and  in  a  short  time 
becomes  smooth;  and  if  you  should  wish  that  the  water  should  be 
drawn  aside  in  order  to  allow  space  for  the  earth  and  uncover  it,  and 
that  in  this  way  it  should  remain  spherical,  this  would  be  impossible 
because  the  water  that  flows  from  Syria  would  be  low,  and  at  the 
island  Aritella  which  is  four  hundred  miles  distant  from  the  strait  of 
Gibraltar  it  would  be  the  high  sea,  which  is  three  thousand  four  hun- 
dred miles  distant  from  the  shores  of  Syria,  and  at  this  island  the  water 
is  very  shallow,  and  beyond  it  there  is  little  depth  to  be  found.

Why  there  is  water  in  the  bigh  parts  of  the  mountains: 
From  the  straits  oi  Gibraltar  to  the  Don  is  three  thousand  five  hun- 
dred miles,  that  is  to  say  one  mile  and  one  sixth,  allowing  a  fall  of 
one  braccio  per  mile  tor  all  water  that  moves  at  a  moderate  rate  of 
speed.  And  the  Caspian  Sea  is  considerably  higher,  and  none  of  the 
mountains  of  Europe  rises  a  mile  above  the  surface  of  our  seas.  One 
might  therefore  say  that  the  water  which  is  in  the  summits  of  our 
mountains  comes  from  the  heights  of  these  seas,  and  from  the  rivers 
which  pour  themselves  down  there  and  which  are  higher,      f  50  r.

and  thirty  feet  across  with  columns  and  sculptures.  The  note  may  be  due  to  the  fact  of 
some  account  of  these  caves  having  come  to  the  knowledge  of  Leonardo.  His  interest

No  simple  reflex  movement  is  ever  as  much  raised  as  the  commence- 
ment of  the  falling  movement. 

To  guard  against  the  percussion  of  the  Arno  at  Rucano  and  to  turn 
it  with  a  gentle  curve  towards  Ricorboli,  and  to  make  the  bank  so 
wide  that  the  fall  of  its  leap  may  be  above  it.  l  31  r. 

BRIDGE  OF  PERA  AT  CONSTANTINOPLE 

Width  forty  braccia,  height  above  the  water  seventy  braccia,  length 
six  hundred  braccia,  that  is  four  hundred  above  the  sea  and  two  hun- 
dred resting  on  land  thus  forming  abutments  to  itself.1  l  66  r. 

In  Romagna  where  all  the  dullards  congregate  they  use  carts  with 
four  equal  wheels,  or  they  have  two  low  in  front  and  two  high  ones 
behind,  and  this  is  a  great  restraint  on  movement  because  more  weight 
is  resting  upon  the  front  wheels  than  upon  those  behind  as  I  have 
shown  in  the  first  of  the  fifth  'Concerning  Elements'. 

And  these  first  wheels  move  less  easily  than  the  large  ones,  so  that 
to  increase  the  weight  in  front  is  to  diminish  the  power  of  movement 
and  so  to  double  the  difficulty. 
[Diagram  ] 

Here  the  larger  wheel  a  has  three  times  the  leverage  of  the  small 
wheel;  consequently  the  small  one  finds  three  times  as  much  resistance 
and  to  add  a  hundred  pounds  [necessitates  adding]  two  hundred  more 
to  the  small  [wheel]  a;  look  how  this  works.  h  72  r. 

[A  note  on  relative  positions  of  towns  between  Bologna  and  Forli] 

Imola  sees  Bologna  at  five  points  from  the  west  towards  the  north- 
west at  a  distance  of  twenty  miles. 

Castel  San  Pietro  is  seen  from  Imola  midway  between  west  and

1  The  time  references  in  this  manuscript  point  to  this  note  as  having  been  written 
in  or  about  the  year  1502.  The  project  seems  to  have  gone  no  farther.  Richter  records 
how  four  years  later  when  Michelangelo  suddenly  left  Rome  he  entertained  the  idea  of 
going  to  Constantinople  where,  as  both  Vasari  and  Condivi  state,  his  services  had  been 
requisitioned  to  make  a  bridge  to  connect  Constantinople  with  Pera.

OF  THE  CUTTING  OF  ABYLA  AND  CALPE  IN  THE 
STRAITS  OF  CADIZ 

The  cutting  of  Abyla  and  Calpe  in  the  straits  of  Cadiz  reduces 
considerably  the  rivers  which  descend  from  the  Alps  and  run  to  the 
north.  And  this  is  proved  by  reason  of  the  fact  that  before  this  cutting 
in  the  mountains  of  Cadiz  was  formed  the  surface  of  the  Mediter- 
ranean Sea  was  very  high,  and  surpassed  the  height  of  three  parts  of 
the  Alps,  and  the  penetration  of  the  sea  through  the  passages  and 
veins  of  the  earth  was  very  high  and  abundant;  and  after  this  cutting 
of  Cadiz  the  surface  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea  there  was  lowered,  and 
the  aforesaid  high  passages  remained  emptied  of  their  waters,  and  the 
rivers  lost  the  abundance  of  their  streams.  b.m.  168  v.

They  do  not  know  why  the  Arno  never  keeps  its  channel.  It  is 
because  the  rivers  which  enter  it  deposit  soil  where  they  enter  and  take

it  away  from  the  other  side,  thus  forming  a  bend  in  the  river  there. 

The  course  of  the  Arno  is  six  miles  from  La  Caprona  to  Leghorn, 
and  twelve  through  the  marshes  which  have  an  expanse  of  thirty-two 
miles,  and  sixteen  up  from  La  Caprona  which  makes  forty-eight;  by 
the  Arno  from  Florence  there  is  a  space  of  sixteen  miles;  to  Vico  is 
sixteen  miles  and  the  canal  is  five;  from  Florence  to  Fucechio  is  forty 
miles  by  the  water  of  the  Arno. 

Fifty-six  miles  by  the  Arno  from  Florence  to  Vico;  and  by  the

the  canal  than  by  the  Arno.1  Windsor:  Drawings   12279

From  the  southern  sea-board  of  Cilicia  may  be  seen  to  the  south  the 
beautiful  island  of  Cyprus,  which  was  the  realm  of  the  goddess  Venus; 
and  many  there  have  been,  who,  impelled  by  her  loveliness,  have  had 
their  ships  and  rigging  broken  upon  the  rocks  which  lie  amidst  the 
seething  waves.  Here  the  beauty  of  some  pleasant  hill  invites  the 
wandering  mariners  to  take  their  ease  among  its  flowery  verdure, 
where  the  zephyrs  continually  come  and  go,  filling  with  sweet  odours 
the  island  and  the  encompassing  sea.  Alas!  How  many  ships  have 
foundered  there!  How  many  vessels  have  been  broken  upon  these 
rocks!  Here  might  be  seen  an  innumerable  host  of  ships;  some  broken 
in  pieces  and  half-buried  in  sand;  here  is  visible  the  poop  of  one,  and 
there  a  prow;  here  a  keel  and  there  a  rib;  and  it  seems  like  a  day  of 
judgment  when  there  shall  be  a  resurrection  of  dead  ships,  so  great  is 
the  mass  that  covers  the  whole  northern  shore.  There  the  northern 
winds  resounding  make  strange  and  fearful  noises.

Atmosphere 

'The  air  moves  like  a  river  and  carries  the 

clouds  with  it;  just  as  running  water  carries 

all  the  things  that  float  upon  it! 

Surface  is  the  name  given  to  the  boundaries  of  bodies  with  the  air  or  I 
would  rather  say  of  the  air  with  bodies,  that  is  what  is  enclosed  between 
the  body  and  the  air  that  surrounds  it;  and  if  the  air  makes  contact  with 
the  body  there  is  no  space  to  put  another  body  there;  consequently  it 
may  be  concluded  that  surface  has  no  body  and  therefore  no  need  of 
position. 

Surface  is  the  name  given  to  that  which  divides  bodies  from  the  air 
which  surrounds  them;  or  as  you  may  prefer  to  say  which  divides  or 
separates  the  air  from  the  things  which  are  located  within  it. 

And  if  the  atmosphere  and  the  bodies  which  are  enclosed  within  it 
are  in  perpetual  contact  and  there  is  not  any  space  between  them,  the 
surface  being  that  which  shows  the  shape  of  the  bodies  this  surface  has 
existence  of  itself.  And  if  the  atmosphere  and  the  body  are  touching 
each  other  no  space  will  remain  there,  so  we  conclude  that  the  surface 
has  existence  and  not  space.  Consequently  this  surface  is  equal  to  noth- 
ing, and  all  the  nothingness  of  the  world  is  equal  to  the  smallest  part 
if  there  can  be  a  part.  Wherefore  we  may  say  that  surface,  line,  and 
point  are  equal  as  between  themselves,  and  each  is  of  itself  equal  to  the 
other  two  joined  together. 

Surface  is  the  name  of  that  division  which  the  body  of  the  air  makes 
with  the  bodies  which  are  enclosed  within  it.  And  it  does  not  partake 
of  the  body  by  which  it  is  surrounded,  nor  of  that  which  it  surrounds; 
on  the  contrary  it  is  the  actual  contact  which  these  bodies  make  to- 
gether. 

Therefore  if  these  bodies  are  in  continual  contact  it  is  necessary  that 
nothing  should  interpose  between  them,  and  consequently  the  surface, 

372 


ATMOSPHERE  373 

which  is  enclosed  there,  is  nothing.  This  surface  has  name  and  not 
substance  because  that  which  has  substance  has  place.  Not  having  place 
it  resembles  nothingness  which  has  name  without  substance;  conse- 
quently the  part  of  nothing  not  having  anything  except  the  name  and 
not  the  substance  this  part  is  equal  to  the  whole;  so  that  by  this  we 
conclude  that  the  point  and  the  line  are  equal  to  the  surface.

ELEMENT  OF  FIRE.  MIDDLE  REGION  OF  THE  ATMOSPHERE 

[With  drawing] 

The  atmosphere  interposed  between  the  fire  and  the  water  partici- 
pates in  the  water  and  the  fire,  but  so  much  more  in  one  than  the  other 
as  it  is  nearer  one  than  the  other.  It  follows  that  the  less  it  participates 
in  each  the  more  remote  it  is  from  them.  And  this  remoteness  occurs  in 
the  middle  region  of  the  atmosphere;  therefore  this  middle  region  is 
in  the  first  stage  of  cold.  From  which  it  follows  that  that  part  of  the 
cloud  which  is  in  closest  contact  with  the  middle  region  becomes  cold- 
est; consequently  the  warmth  of  the  sphere  of  fire  of  this  cloud  which 
is  the  attracter  and  mover  is  of  less  potency,  and  from  this  it  follows 
that  the  movements  of  the  particles  of  moisture  which  form  the  clouds 
are  slower;  and  from  this  it  follows  that,  in  the  process  of  these  par- 
ticles of  moisture  rising,  the  nearer  they  come  to  the  vicinity  of  this 
middle  region  the  slower  the  movement  becomes,  and  the  movement 
of  that  which  follows  is  swifter  than  it,  and  consequently  it  overtakes 
it.  And  it  often  happens  that  it  strikes  underneath  and  mingles  with  it 
and  thus  increases  its  quantity  and  weight.  The  atmosphere  in  conse- 
quence not  being  able  to  support  it  makes  way  for  it  to  descend,  and 
in  doing  this  it  strikes  all  the  drops  which  interrupt  its  course,  and  in- 
corporates many  in  itself,  and  acquiring  weight  it  acquires  velocity  in 
its  descent  [.  .  .  .].  And  this  is  the  reason  why  after  it  has  penetrated 
the  whole  of  the  cloud  in  every  stage  of  descent  its  pace  will  become 
slower,  and  there  will  be  many  occasions  when  these  particles  will  not 
arrive  at  the  ground.  If  then  these  particles  at  the  highest  part  of  their 
height  acquire  so  much  gravity  that  the  weight  produces  a  swift  de- 
scent, then  without  doubt  this  movement  will  increase  their  size,  inas- 
much as  this  speed  will  cause  it  to  overtake  the  drops  which  are  de- 


374  ATMOSPHERE 

scending  below  it  and  incorporate  them  in  itself,  and  this  will  bring 
about  an  increase  of  weight  at  every  stage  of  its  descent. 

The  descent  of  the  drops  which  strike  together  without  wind  will 
not  be  straight  but  at  an  angle. 

This  is  proved  by  the  fact  that  if  two  bodies  strike  one  another  in 
the  air  the  one  which  is  less  in  bulk  will  be  diverted  more  from  its 
course. 

And  if  two  particles  of  dew  or  of  quicksilver  varying  in  size  become 
joined  together  each  will  be  removed  from  its  position  and  the  propor- 
tion of  their  movements  will  be  as  that  of  their  size. 

The  drop  of  that  liquid  is  of  the  most  perfect  roundness  which  is  of 
less  .  .  . 

Why  if  two  spherical  liquids  unequal  in  quantity  come  to  the  be- 
ginning of  contact  with  each  other  does  the  greater  draw  to  itself  the 
lesser  and  incorporate  it  immediately  without  destroying  the  perfection 
of  its  own  roundness. 

It  is  difficult  to  give  an  answer;  but  I  will  not  for  this  reason  refrain 
from  stating  my  opinion.  Water  clothed  with  atmosphere  naturally 
desires  to  be  united  in  its  sphere,  because  in  such  a  position  it  is  de- 
prived of  gravity,  which  gravity  is  double;  for  the  whole  has  a  gravity 
which  depends  on  the  centre  of  the  elements,  and  there  is  a  second 
gravity  dependent  on  the  centre  of  this  watery  sphere,  for  if  it  were  not 
so  it  would  form  by  itself  a  half  sphere  only  which  is  that  which  stands 
from  the  centre  upwards;  and  I  do  not  perceive  that  the  human  in- 
tellect has  any  means  of  acquiring  perception  of  this  except  by  saying 
as  one  says  of  the  action  of  the  magnet  when  it  draws  the  iron,  that 
such  virtue  is  a  hidden  property  of  which  there  are  in  nature  an  in- 
finite number. 

But  it  may  be  asked  why  there  is  greater  perfection  in  the  little 
sphere  of  the  liquid  than  in  the  large  one.  To  this  the  reply  is  that  the 
little  drop  has  a  lightness  which  more  resembles  the  atmosphere  that 
surrounds  it  than  the  large  drop  has,  and  from  the  fact  of  this  small 
difference  it  is  more  sustained  from  its  centre  downwards  by  this 
atmosphere  than  the  large  drop.  And  as  a  proof  of  this,  one  may  take 
as  an  instance  the  little  drops  which  are  so  small  in  shape  as  to  be  of 
themselves  almost  invisible  but  which  are  visible  when  there  are  a  large 


ATMOSPHERE  375 

quantity  together;  and  these  are  the  particles  which  go  to  form  clouds 
and  mist. 

Why  the  atmosphere  when  it  has  been  submerged  rises  enveloped  in 
a  sheet  of  water.  Which  settles  on  its  surface  in  the  shape  of  a  half 
sphere. 

And  if  it  is  slimy  water  it  moves  through  the  atmosphere  in  the  form 
of  a  sphere.

The  body  of  the  air  is  filled  with  an  infinite  number  of  radiant

together  in  their  separate  courses  throughout  the  whole  of  the  sur- 
rounding air;  and  they  are  of  equal  power,  and  all  have  as  much 
capacity  as  each  one  and  each  has  as  much  as  all;  and  through  them 
the  image  of  the  body  is  carried  all  into  the  whole  and  all  into  a  part, 
and  each  receives  of  itself  in  its  every  smallest  part  the  whole  cause.

The  movement  of  the  thunderbolt  which  originates  in  the  cloud  is 
curved,  because  it  bends  from  thickness  to  thinness,  this  thickness  being 
occasioned  by  the  fury  of  the  aforesaid  movement.  For  this  thunderbolt 
not  being  able  to  extend  in  the  direction  in  which  it  commenced,  bends 
into  the  course  that  is  freest  and  proceeds  by  this  until  it  has  created 
the  second  obstacle,  and  so  following  this  rule  it  continues  on  to  the 
end.  c.a.  121  r.  b 

Why  flame  does  not  occur  except  above  some  space  where  there  is 
smoke,  and  why  it  does  not  strike  except  through  its  smoke.  This  hap-

nected by  ends  which  curve  concavely  and  not  convexly,  and  air  within 
water  does  the  same.  c.a.  131  r.  b 


376  ATMOSPHERE 

That  the  atmosphere  attracts  to  itself  like  a  magnet  all  the  images  of. 
the  things  which  surround  it,  and  not  only  their  bodily  shapes  but  also 
their  nature,  is  clearly  to  be  seen  in  the  case  of  the  sun,  which  is  a  hot 
and  luminous  body.  All  the  atmosphere  which  is  exposed  to  its  influ- 
ence is  charged  in  all  its  parts  with  light  and  heat,  and  it  all  receives 
within  itself  the  shape  of  that  which  is  the  source  of  this  heat  and  radi- 
ance and  does  the  same  also  in  each  minutest  part.  The  north  star  is 
shown  to  do  the  same  by  the  needle  of  the  compass;  and  each  of  the 
planets  does  the  like  without  itself  undergoing  any  diminution. 

Among  the  products  of  the  earth  the  same  is  found  to  happen  with 
musk  and  other  scents.  c.a.  138  v.  b 

The  cloud  carried  by  the  warmth  which  is  shut  up  within  it  thrusts 
itself  towards  [....]  disc  of  fire,  comes  to  the  cold  region  of  the  air, 
which  is  frozen  on  the  outer  side  but  is  not  frozen  within,  because  the 
warmth  which  has  carried  it  up  there  preserves  it  from  such  cold;  and 
this  brings  to  pass  three  circumstances,  the  first  being  the  evaporation 
of  the  moisture  which  after  being  pent  up  through  the  cold  separates 
and  dissolves  into  vapour  and  produces  a  raging  wind;  the  second  is 
the  rain  that  is  produced  by  the  accumulation  of  the  particles  of  moist 
vapour,  for  those  of  swift  movement  driven  by  the  heat  clash  against 
those  which  are  moving  more  slowly,  and  as  they  encounter  that  part 
of  the  cloud  which  becomes  cold  towards  its  extremities  the  particles 
of  the  moisture  fasten  themselves  together  and  acquire  weight,  and  so 
it  descends  to  earth  in  big  drops;  and  on  the  very  extremity  of  this 
cloud  the  particles  of  moisture  are  continually  freezing  into  balls  of 
various  sizes,  and  these  cannot  expand  because  of  the  intensity  of  the 
cold,  but  come  together  with  swift  movement  at  the  spot  where  the 
sphericity  of  the  drop  is  produced,  and  therefore  the  hail  is  composed 
of  [....]  of  many  roundnesses  which  are  joined  together.

The  elements  are  changed  one  into  another,  and  when  the  air  is 
changed  into  water  by  the  contact  it  has  with  its  cold  region  this  then 
attracts  to  itself  with  fury  all  the  surrounding  air  which  moves  furi- 
ously to  fill  up  the  place  vacated  by  the  air  that  has  escaped;  and  so 
one  mass  moves  in  succession  behind  another,  until  they  have  in  part 


ATMOSPHERE  377 

equalised  the  space  from  which  the  air  has  been  divided,  and  this  is 
the  wind. 

But  if  the  water  is  changed  to  air  then  the  air  which  first  occupied 
the  space  into  which  the  aforesaid  increase  flows  must  needs  yield  place 
in  speed  and  impetus  to  the  air  which  has  been  produced,  and  this  is 
the  wind. 

The  mist  that  is  in  the  wind  is  produced  by  heat,  and  it  is  smitten 
and  banished  by  the  cold,  and  this  cold  drives  it  before  it,  and  from 
where  it  has  been  driven  the  warmth  is  left  cold.  And  because  the  mist 
which  is  driven  cannot  turn  upwards  because  of  the  cold  that  presses  it 
down,  and  cannot  turn  downwards  because  of  the  heat  that  raises  it  up, 
it  therefore  becomes  necessary  for  it  to  proceed  across,  and  I  for  my 
part  consider  that  it  has  no  movement  of  itself,  for  as  the  said  powers 
are  equal  they  confine  the  middle  substance  equally,  and  should  it 
chance  to  escape  the  fugitive  is  dispersed  and  scattered  in  every  direc- 
tion, just  as  with  a  sponge  filled  with  water,  which  is  squeezed  so  that 
the  water  escapes  out  of  the  centre  of  the  sponge  in  every  direction. 
So  therefore  does  the  northern  wind  become  the  producer  of  all  the 
winds  at  one  and  the  same  time.  c.a.  169  r.  a 

[Of  winds] 

The  north  wind  comes  to  us  from  high  and  frozen  places  and  there- 
fore it  cannot  give  off  moisture,  and  consequently  it  is  pure  and  clean, 
because  it  is  cold  and  dry,  and  for  this  reason  it  is  very  light  in  itself 
but  its  speed  makes  it  powerful  wherever  it  strikes. 

The  south  wind  has  not  the  same  purity,  and  since  it  is  warm  and 
dry  it  dissolves  the  thicknesses  of  the  watery  vapours  which  the  Medi- 
terranean Sea  exhales,  and  these  then  follow  in  the  wake  of  this  wind 
and  become  dissolved  in  it;  and  so  for  this  reason  this  wind  as  it  strikes 
Europe  comes  to  be  warm  and  damp  and  heavy  in  its  nature,  and 
although  its  movement  is  sluggish  its  stroke  is  no  less  powerful  than 
that  of  the  north  wind. 

Every  wind  is  by  nature  cold  and  dry  but  it  takes  to  itself  as  many 
different  attributes  as  are  those  of  the  places  through  which  it  passes, 
leaving  behind  it  in  passing  dampness  and  cold  to  the  dry  and  hot 
places  and  taking  from  these  same  hot  dry  places  their  dryness  and 
heat.  So  in  its  movement  in  each  region  it  puts  on  different  attributes, 


378  ATMOSPHERE 

and  in  becoming  warm  and  dry  it  weakens  its  power,  and  in  resuming 
the  things  it  had  left  behind  it  resumes  the  aforesaid  forces  together 
with  them,  for  when  there  is  the  same  swiftness  of  movement  that 
thing  which  is  of  greater  weight  will  give  a  greater  percussion,  and  so 
conversely  the  lighter  thing  will  give  a  less  percussion. 

When  in  summer  the  sun  returns  to  the  parts  of  Africa  the  humidity 
which  had  been  increased  there  by  the  winter  becomes  dissolved  and  its 
bulk  increases,  and  it  searches  in  fury  for  places  to  contain  this  increase. 
And  this  is  the  south  wind,  which  in  autumn  drives  the  maritime 
vapours  of  the  Mediterranean  before  it,  and  condenses  them  above  our 
regions,  until  they  fall  down  again  through  lack  of  power  to  maintain 
themselves. 

When  many  winds  strive  together  then  the  waves  of  the  sea  have  not 
a  free  course,  but  they  clash  together  and  raise  themselves  up  and  at 
times  cause  ships  to  founder;  and  in  such  a  contest  the  stronger  wind 
will  be  the  victor  through  its  being  lighter  and  less  interwoven  or 
mingled  with  the  other  winds.  c.a.  169  v.  a 

All  objects  have  all  their  images  and  likenesses  projected  and 
mingled  together  throughout  the  whole  extent  of  the  surrounding 
atmosphere.  The  image  of  every  point  of  their  bodily  surfaces  exists  in 
every  point  of  this  atmosphere,  and  all  the  images  of  the  objects  are  in 
every  point  of  this  atmosphere.  The  whole  and  a  part  of  the  likeness 
of  the  atmosphere  exists  in  every  point  of  the  surface  of  the  objects 
which  are  over  against  it.  Therefore  the  part  and  the  whole  of  the 
images  of  the  objects  appear  in  all  and  in  each  part  of  the  atmosphere 
which  is  opposite  to  them;  and  the  substance  of  the  atmosphere  is  seen 
reflected  in  the  whole  and  in  each  part  of  the  surface  of  these  objects. 
Therefore  clearly  we  may  say  that  the  likeness  of  each  object  either 
whole  or  in  part  is  interchangeably  in  each  part  and  in  the  whole  of  the 
objects  opposite  to  it,  as  is  seen  with  mirrors  when  placed  one  opposite 
to  another.  c.a.  179  v.  c 

Those  winds  which  descending  scour  the  parts  of  the  mountains  that 
lean  towards  the  sea,  penetrate  to  its  bed  and  make  waves,  with  sides 
that  resemble  the  shores  from  which  they  descend,  and  these  waves 
consequently  have  often  deep  narrow  spaces  between  them,  as  I  said 
in  the  book  on  the  movement  of  water.  And  this  tempest  lasts  only  a 


ATMOSPHERE  379 

short  time  after  the  stroke  of  the  wind,  lor  alter  it  has  struck  it  leaps 
hack  into  the  air  until  it  finds  the  other  wind,  and  striking  against  this 
it  compresses  it  and  again  leaps  downward  after  the  manner  oi  the 
rivers  as  they  strike  the  shores. 

On  the  summits  of  the  mountains  the  wind  is  of  great  density,  and 
in  the  mouths  of  the  valleys  when  the  mountains  which  shut  in  these 
valleys  are  of  great  height.  The  entry  of  opposite  winds  one  beneath 
the  other  with  contrary  movements  may  occur  for  two  reasons,  namely 
either  through  the  reflex  movement  of  the  wind  which  turns  back  after 
having  struck  upon  the  mountains,  or  by  the  clashing  together  when 
the  weaker  parts  of  opposing  winds  strike  against  the  stronger  parts. 
The  revolutions  or  eddies  of  the  winds  are  born  in  the  winds  as  they 
open  out  in  the  embrace  of  the  mountains  or  of  some  building,  and 
afterwards  join  together  and  strike  with  impetus;  and  their  reflex 
movements  are  not  made  in  a  straight  line,  for  it  is  checked  in  its  own 
sphere,  being  moved  by  a  substance  like  itself  which  has  the  power  to 
check  and  bend  its  direct  impetus.  So  therefore  this  wind  not  being 
able  to  extend  proceeds  to  exhaust  its  impulse  by  a  [curving]  move- 
ment, and  goes  upwards  in  order  to  consume  its  impetus,  this  being 
necessary  for  three  reasons;  firstly  because  it  cannot  at  once  turn  on 
the  very  lines  of  its  descent,  secondly  because  they  strike  at  angles  less 
than  right  angles,  and  because  they  cannot  leap  back  on  lines  equal  to 
those  of  their  incidence.  c.a.  180  v.  a 

[Cloud,  wind  and  thunderbolt] 

As  water  flows  in  different  directions  out  of  a  squeezed  sponge,  or 
air  from  a  pair  of  bellows,  so  it  is  with  the  thin  transparent  clouds  that 
have  been  driven  up  to  a  height  through  the  reflection  occasioned  by 
the  heat,  the  first  part  which  finds  itself  uppermost  being  that  which 
comes  first  to  the  cold  region,  and  here  remaining  through  the  cold  and 
dryness  awaits  its  companion.  That  part  below  as  it  ascends  towards  the 
part  that  is  stationary  treats  the  air  which  happens  to  be  in  the  centre 
as  though  it  was  a  syringe,  and  this  then  escapes  crosswise  and  down- 
wards, not  going  upwards  because  it  finds  the  cloud  so  thick  that  it 
cannot  penetrate  it. 

So  for  this  reason  all  the  winds  that  make  war  upon  the  earth's  sur- 
face come  down  from  above,  and  as  they  strike  upon  the  resisting  earth 


380  ATMOSPHERE 

they  produce  a  movement  of  recoil,  and  this  as  it  desires  to  raise  itself 
up  again  to  a  height  finds  there  the  other  wind,  which  descends  and 
subdues  its  ascent,  whereby  the  said  upward  movement  is  constrained 
to  break  its  natural  order,  and  taking  a  transverse  route  it  pursues  a 
violent  course  which  grazes  incessantly  the  surface  of  the  earth. 

And  when  the  aforesaid  winds  strike  upon  the  salt  waters  the  form 
is  clearly  visible,  in  the  angle  that  is  created  by  the  line  of  incidence 
and  that  of  the  recoil  from  which  proceed  the  proud  menacing  and 
engulfing  waves,  of  which  the  one  for  the  most  part  is  the  cause  of 
the  other. 

Here  someone  perhaps  may  think  to  censure  me  by  putting  forward 
as  against  my  contention  as  to  the  winds  the  argument  that  these  can- 
not be  produced  by  the  clouds  because  then  it  would  be  necessary  for 
one  to  remain  stationary  and  give  movement  to  another,  and  this  does 
not  appear  to  be  so,  because  when  the  north  wind  blows  the  clouds  all 
collect  together  and  fly  before  it.  The  reply  to  this  is  that  when  the  air 
is  still  and  a  full  company  of  clouds  have  risen  to  a  height,  and  there 
above  as  has  been  said  press  themselves  together,  they  squeeze  out  so 
much  air  from  themselves,  which  through  the  violence  exerted  creates 
such  movement  in  the  air,  that  as  you  may  see  it  communicates  its 
movement  to  the  other  lesser  clouds.  And  as  they  also  drive  the  air 
forwards  in  the  same  way  they  even  furnish  themselves  with  a  reason 
for  greater  flight;  for  when  a  cloud  either  finds  itself  in  the  midst  of 
others  or  apart  from  them,  if  it  produces  the  wind  behind  itself  that 
air  which  is  between  it  and  its  neighbour  following  comes  to  multiply, 
and  by  multiplying  acts  in  the  same  way  as  the  powder  does  in  the 
mortar,  for  this  expels  from  the  position  near  to  it  the  less  heavy  body 
and  the  lighter  weight.  And  this  being  the  case  it  follows  that  the 
cloud  in  driving  the  wind  towards  the  others  which  offer  resistance  is 
the  cause  of  putting  these  themselves  to  flight.  And  by  sending  this 
vanguard  of  the  winds  before  itself  it  also  adds  volume  to  the  rest.  And 
if  it  should  send  them  crosswise  it  would  form  a  kind  of  rotatory  circle 
around  some  cloud  and  then  return  in  concert  with  the  others. 

As  the  natural  warmth  spread  through  the  human  limbs  is  driven 
back  by  the  surrounding  cold  which  is  its  opposite  and  enemy,  and 
flowing  back  to  the  lake  of  the  heart  and  the  liver  fortifies  itself  there, 
making  of  these  its  fortress  and  defence,  so  the  clouds  being  made  up 


ATMOSPHERE  381 

of  warmth  and  moisture,  and  in  summer  of  certain  dry  vapours,  and 
finding  themselves  in  the  cold  dry  region,  act  after  the  manner  of  cer- 
tain flowers  and  leaves  which  when  attacked  by  the  cold  hoar-frost 
press  themselves  close  together  and  offer  a  greater  resistance. 

So  these  in  their  first  contact  with  the  cold  air  commence  to  resist 
and  not  to  wish  to  pass  farther  forward;  the  others  below  continue 
constantly  to  rise,  the  part  above  being  stationary  proceeds  to  thicken, 
the  warmth  and  dryness  recede  to  the  centre,  the  part  above  abandoned 
by  the  warmth  commences  to  freeze  or  to  express  it  more  exactly  to 
dissolve,  and  as  the  clouds  below  continue  to  rise  their  warmth  is 
brought  nearer  to  the  cold  and  so  being  constrained  to  reduce  itself  to 
its  primary  element  is  suddenly  transformed  into  fire,  and  this  twines 
itself  among  the  dry  vapour  and  in  the  centre  of  the  cloud  makes  a 
great  increase,  and  as  it  kindles  itself  within  the  cloud  which  has  be- 
come cool  it  makes  a  noise  that  resembles  that  of  water  falling  on  boil- 
ing pitch  or  oil,  or  of  molten  copper  when  plunged  into  cold  water. 
Even  so  driven  forth  by  its  opposite  it  shatters  the  cloud  that  would 
withstand  it,  and  hurtling  through  the  air  breaks  and  destroys  every- 
thing that  opposes  it,  and  this  is  the  thunderbolt.  c.a.  212  v.  a 

The  air  is  compressible  to  infinity,  and  this  is  shown  by  the  extremely 
swift  movement  of  the  radiance  which  produces  the  mighty  thunder 
of  the  heavens,  which  bends  and  twists  itself  in  different  directions  so 
much  the  more  as  the  air  and  cloud  before  it  is  compressed  and  .  .  . 

Example  of  thunder 

The  process  of  evaporation  of  water  thrown  upon  burning  coals  is 
as  that  of  the  fire  when  kindled  among  the  clouds  which  evaporate 
with  such  fury  as  to  restrict  the  course  of  the  brightness  that  has  been 
created;  that  is  to  say  that  as  the  water  is  changed  into  vapour  and 
becomes  steam  as  it  increases  so  the  cloud  evaporates  and  becomes 
changed  into  air,  which  by  its  increase  hems  in  and  restricts  the  flame 
which  is  produced  in  it.  c.a.  213  r.  a 

Flame  has  its  beginning  and  end  in  smoke. 

The  smoke  out  of  which  the  flame  is  produced  is  of  much  greater 
heat  than  the  smoke  in  which  this  flame  ends,  because  in  the  first 


382  ATMOSPHERE 

smoke  there  is  the  nascent  power  of  the  flame,  and  the  last  is  the  dying 
away  of  the  same  flame. 

Wood  that  is  young  and  dry  will  produce  smoke  of  a  more  intense 
blue  than  wood  that  is  old  and  damp. 

The  blue  flame  which  is  midway  between  the  darkness  and  the  light 
comes  into  being  between  the  nutritive  portion  of  the  candle  and  its 
flame,  and  is  of  greater  heat  and  radiance  than  the  smoke  and  of  less 
heat  and  radiance  than  its  flame;  and  the  vapour  cannot  transform 
itself  into  flame,  without  first  becoming  changed  to  this  blue  colour, 
and  this  is  known  in  the  case  of  smoke. 

Flame  is  condensed  smoke,  formed  out  of  the  meeting  together  of 
the  air  that  is  in  this  blue  smoke,  which  .  .  .

grease  that  is  in  the  candle.  The  white  smoke  that  surrounds  the  vestige 
of  the  flame  is  the  spiritual  transit  of  the  flame  of  this  candle,  which  in 
its  lowest  part  is  mingled  with  the  topmost  part  of  the  aforesaid  blue 
smoke,  and  in  the  upper  part  is  mingled  with  the  smoke  which  pro- 
ceeds from  the  flame  of  the  candle.  c.a.  237  v.  a

The  southern  winds  are  more  powerful  in  the  northern  than  in  the 
southern  regions  and  in  summer  than  in  winter;  and  this  is  because 
the  sun  dissolves  all  the  moisture  that  rises  from  the  Mediterranean 
Sea,  which  cannot  dissolve  during  the  cold  of  winter,  and  of  these 
vapours  few  rise  and  these  few  are  dissolved  in  water.  But  when  the 
sun  passes  beyond  the  circle  of  the  equinox,  and  it  is  winter  here  at 
hand  and  summer  over  yonder  the  sun  dissolves  all  the  vapours  as 
they  rise,  so  that  they  glide  in  aerial  waves  as  far  as  the  chief  [moun- 
tains] of  Europe,  and  there  coming  upon  the  cold  in  the  autumn  they 
turn  into  rain,  and  in  the  winter  they  are  knit  together  in  snow,  and 
fall  in  snowstorms  and  so  proceed  little  by  little  to  stifle  the  breath  of 
the  aforesaid  winds.  c.a.  246  v.  a

I  Of  flame  and  wind] 

The  bottom  part  of  the  flame  is  the  first  beginning  of  this  flame 
through  which  passes  all  its  nutriment  of  fat;  and  this  is  of  so  much 
less  heat  than  the  rest  of  the  flame  as  it  is  of  less  brightness;  and  it  is 
blue  in  colour  and  is  the  part  in  which  its  nutriment  is  purged  and 
disposed  of. 

That  has  the  brighter  flame,  and  this  is  the  first  to  come  into  exist- 
ence when  the  flame  is  created,  and  it  comes  into  existence  in  spherical 
shape,  and  after  a  span  of  life  produces  above  itself  a  very  small  flame, 
radiant  in  colour  and  shaped  like  a  heart  with  its  point  turned  to  the 
sky,  and  this  proceeds  to  multiply  continuously  on  towards  infinity, 
by  means  of  its  acquiring  possession  of  the  substance  that  feeds  it. 

The  blue  flame  is  formed  of  spherical  shape  because  it  is  not  of  such 
great  heat  as  exceeds  the  lightness  of  the  air;  and  for  this  reason  it 
does  not  in  itself  form  a  pyramidal  figure,  but  remains  in  spherical 
shape  until  it  has  warmed  sufficiently  the  air  which  surrounds  it,  and 
because  the  chief  warming  of  the  air  is  above  the  principal  heat  of  this 
blue  flame,  this  heat  being  produced  by  that  part  where  the  natural 
desire  of  the  flame  is  to  move  itself,  that  is  to  the  sphere  of  fire  by  the 
shortest  way.  Therefore  the  fire  comes  into  existence  in  the  upper  part 
of  the  blue  spherical  flame,  in  a  small  round  figure,  the  roundness  of 
which  immediately  undergoes  some  extension  and  assumes  the  shape 
of  a  heart,  of  which  the  point  is  turned  towards  the  sky.  And  this  shape 
immediately  and  with  swift  dilation  overcomes  the  power  that  feeds  it, 
and  penetrates  the  air  which  serves  it  as  a  covering.  But  this  blue  colour 
remains  in  the  base  of  this  flame  as  may  be  seen  in  the  light  of  the 
candle;  and  this  comes  to  pass  because  in  this  position  the  flame  is 
always  less  warm  than  elsewhere,  because  there  is  the  first  encounter 
which  provides  the  nourishment  of  the  flame  with  this  flame,  and  it 
is  there  that  the  first  heat  is  produced,  and  this  is  feebler  and  causes 
less  warmth  because  it  is  only  the  commencement  of  the  heat.  .  .  . 

That  wind  will  be  of  briefer  movement  which  is  of  more  impetuous 
beginning;  and  this  the  fire  has  taught  us  as  it  bursts  forth  from  the 
mortars,  for  it  shows  us  the  form  and  speed  of  the  movement  in  the 
smoke  as  it  penetrates  the  air  opposite  to  it  in  brief  and  spreading 
revolution. 


384  ATMOSPHERE 

But  the  impetuosity  of  the  wind  is  fitful,  as  is  shown  by  the  dust  that 
it  raises  in  the  air  in  its  various  twists  and  turns.  One  perceives  also 
in  the  chains  of  the  Alps  how  the  clashing  together  of  the  winds  is 
caused  by  the  impetus  of  various  forces.  One  sees  also  how  the  flags 
of  ships  flutter  in  different  ways;  how  on  the  sea  one  part  of  the  water 
is  struck  and  not  another;  and  the  same  thing  happening  in  the  pi- 
azzas and  on  the  sandbanks  of  the  rivers,  where  the  dust  is  swept 
together  furiously  in  one  part  and  not  in  another.  And  since  these 
effects  give  us  experience  of  the  nature  of  their  causes  we  can  say  with 
certainty  that  the  wind  which  has  the  more  impetuous  origin  will  have 
the  briefer  movement,  from  the  experience  that  has  been  referred  to 
above  as  to  the  brief  movement  of  the  smoke  from  the  mouth  of  the 
mortar.  And  this  arises  from  the  resistance  that  the  air  makes  on  being 
compressed  by  the  percussion  of  this  smoke,  which  also  itself,  as  has 
been  seen  clearly  shows  compression  when  it  offers  resistance  to  the 
wind.  But  if  the  wind  is  of  slow  movement  it  will  extend  a  long  way 
in  a  straight  course,  because  the  air  penetrated  by  it  will  not  become 
condensed  opposite  to  it  and  thus  thwart  its  movement,  but  will  readily 
expand  spreading  its  course  over  a  very  great  space. 


OF  EDDYING  WINDS 

When  a  wind  has  been  divided  by  mountains  or  other  erections,  if 
on  coming  together  again  it  should  assume  the  shape  of  a  rectangle,  the 
movement  which  it  makes  after  this  reunion  will  be  of  a  rotatory  nature 
in  the  shape  of  a  twisted  column;  and  if  the  winds  which  are  thus  re- 
united should  be  equal  then  this  column  will  not  change  its  position; 
but  if  the  winds  are  unequal  the  column  will  move  in  the  direction  of 
the  weaker  wind.  c.a.  270  v.  a 

Fire  or  other  heat  lightens  moisture  and  makes  it  lighter  than  the 
air;  for  which  cause  this  moisture  rises  to  the  middle  region  of  the  air, 
and  finding  there  the  maximum  cold  of  the  air,  the  fire  or  heat  infused 
through  this  cloud  flies  towards  the  centre,  and  there  becoming  strong 
separates  the  moist  vapour  from  the  dry,  and  it  is  for  this  reason  that 
the  fire  becomes  kindled  there  and  turns  into  steam  a  great  part  of  the 
moisture  which  is  round  about  this  fire.  And  this  process  of  vaporisa-

lion  as  it  increases  restricts  the  fire,  and  the  fire  thus  restricted  acquires 
potency  and  bursts  through  the  cloud  in  the  part  in  which  it  is  weakest, 
and  forms  a  gate  tor  the  movement  of  the  thunderbolt  and  the  wind. 

Whether  the  wind  is  caused  amid  the  air,  and  cannot  make  any  move- 
ment unless  it  is  supported  in  the  place  where  it  resists  by  the  opposite 
side  of  the  movement,  as  is  seen  to  be  the  case  with  the  rays  driven  by 
the  fire,  for  through  the  percussion  that  the  fire  makes  in  the  air  which 
offers  some  resistance  to  it,  these  fly  more  slowly  than  this  fire;  and  if 
this  were  not  the  case  such  ray  would  be  without  movement. 

Further  we  may  say:  the  wind  moves  in  a  straight  line  and  not  as 
Aristotle  would  have  it  in  a  circular  line;  and  this  we  learn  from  the 
movement  of  a  storm  at  sea  when  there  is  no  wind,  for  it  is  a  sign  that 
such  wind  follows  its  straight  line  leaving  below  it  the  curve  of  the  sea. 

Why  the  clouds  are  formed  with  various  round  shapes  which  are 
separated  at  different  spaces  one  from  another: 

The  movements  of  the  air  spring  from  the  dispersal  and  collection 
of  moisture. 

Heat  separates  and  disperses  and  cold  assembles  and  freezes  or 
condenses.  c.a.  279  r.  b 


OF  THE  DROPS  THAT  FORM  IN  THE  AIR 

Drops  are  formed  in  the  air  through  the  mists  or  clouds  by  various 
movements,  as  when  they  encounter  each  other  and  become  condensed 
or  unite  in  the  movement  of  the  same  cloud  in  the  same  direction, 
when  one  part  of  the  cloud  is  swifter  or  slower  than  the  other;  for  as 
the  swifter  part  is  behind  the  slower  it  conquers  it  in  its  course  and 
overtakes  it,  and  condenses  it  and  out  of  many  small  drops  makes  one 
large  one,  and  this  acquires  weight  and  falls.  But  unless  the  drops  are 
so  formed  as  to  be  of  considerable  size  they  are  consumed  by  the  fric- 
tion they  make  with  the  air  as  they  traverse  it.  c.a.  292  r.  a 

The  moist  wind  which  is  found  in  the  caverns  that  have  both  en- 
trance and  exit  can  produce  water,  and  this  especially  when  these 
caverns  have  twisted  and  shapeless  sides;  but  this  production  of  water 
is  not  permanent  in  its  effect  for  when  the  wind  is  lacking  the  supply 
ceases,  and  if  a  contrary  wind  should  enter  by  the  opposite  mouth  of 


386  ATMOSPHERE 

this  cavern  the  water  which  bathed  its  walls  will  become  evaporated 
and  changed  into  air;  and  if  this  cavern  have  an  entrance  but  no  exit 
the  moist  wind  which  strikes  its  mouth  could  not  enter  there  unless 
the  air  within  that  filled  it  were  expelled.  And  since  two  opposite 
movements  cannot  penetrate  each  other  it  must  needs  be  that  the  air 
that  dwells  within  the  cavern  will  find  it  easier  to  be  condensed  than 
to  escape,  and  for  this  reason  it  will  resist  the  entrance  of  the  wind 
which  beats  upon  it.  c.a.  296  v.  b 

The  images  of  every  visible  object  are  all  infused  in  all  the  air  over 
against  them,  and  are  all  separated  in  every  part  of  the  same  air. 

The  images  of  objects  which  confusedly  as  they  mingle  fill  with 
themselves  the  air  over  against  them  are  all  in  all  this  air  and  all  in 
every  part  of  it.  c.a.  345  r.  b 

Every  body  situated  within  the  luminous  air  fills  the  infinite  parts  of 
this  air  circle-wise  with  its  images,  and  it  is  all  in  all  and  all  in  the  part, 
and  goes  lessening  its  images  throughout  the  equidistant  surrounding 
space  like  a  .  .  .

1.  The  stone  thrown  into  the  water  becomes  the  centre  of  various 
circles,  and  these  have  as  their  centre  the  spot  which  has  been  struck. 

2.  And  the  air  in  the  same  way  is  filled  with  circles,  the  centres  of 
which  are  the  sounds  and  voices  formed  within  them. 

How  the  various  circles  of  the  water  form  round  the  spot  which  has 
been  struck  by  the  stone. 

The  stone  where  it  strikes  the  surface  of  the  water  creates  circles 
round  itself  which  proceed  to  expand  so  much  that  they  die  away;  and 
the  air  also  when  struck  by  a  voice  or  a  noise  departing  circle-wise  in 
the  same  way  proceeds  to  lose  itself  so  that  the  nearest  perceives  better, 
and  the  more  distant  hears  less. 

COMPARISON  OF  HOW  THE  THINGS  COME  TO  THE  EYE 

Just  as  the  air  struck  by  the  voice,  the  water  by  the  stone  proceed 
in  circular  movement  revealing  their  cause,  and  these  circles  make  their 
centre  in  the  place  which  has  been  struck,  and  the  farther  away  they 
proceed  from  it  .  .  .  c.a.  373  r.  b

The  fifth  essence  is  infused  through  the  air  as  is  the  clement  of  fire, 
although  each  of  these  may  have  its  reason  in  itself  or  through  itself; 
and  since  each  particle  is  supplied  with  nutritive  matter  it  acquires 
growth  and  increase  of  form;  and  if  the  nourishment  be  taken  away 
from  them  they  suddenly  abandon  this  body  and  return  to  their  first 
nature.  c.a.  393  v.  a 

The  air  is  all  in  all  and  all  in  its  image  in  the  part  set  over  against  it. 

If  within  the  air  there  be  no  opaque  body  the  whole  of  it  has  a 
capacity  which  extends  over  the  whole  and  over  the  part,  and  the  part 
has  a  capacity  which  extends  over  the  part  and  over  the  whole. 

Therefore  we  may  say  that  the  air  is  all  entwined  in  all  of  it,  and  is 
filled  with  the  infinite  rays  of  the  images  of  the  bodies  which  are 
situated  within  it,  and  this  air  is  full  of  an  infinite  number  of  points, 
and  every  point  is  indivisible,  and  the  parts  of  this  indivisibility  of  all 
the  images  of  the  parts  of  bodies  set  over  against  them  have  capacity, 
and  in  these  points  they  are  entirely  united  and  entirely  divided  and 
separated  without  confusion  the  one  from  the  other. 

And  the  pyramids  of  the  images  are  spread  throughout  the  whole  of 
this  air  without  occupation  of  space  the  one  of  the  other,  and  each  for 
itself,  and  are  all  divided  through  all  and  united  through  all. 

And  although  the  images  approach  the  eye  in  the  form  of  pyramids 
the  eye  is  not  conscious  of  this  unless  it  forms  a  pyramid  opposite  to  the 
thing  seen.  c.a.  396  r.  b 

Just  as  the  stone  thrown  into  the  water  becomes  the  centre  and  cause 
of  various  circles,  and  the  sound  made  in  the  air  spreads  itself  out  in 
circles,  so  every  body  placed  within  the  luminous  air  spreads  itself  out 
in  circles  and  fills  the  surrounding  parts  with  an  infinite  number  of 
images  of  itself,  and  appears  all  in  all  and  all  in  each  smallest  part. 

a  9  v. 

OF  COLD 

I  say  that  cold  proceeds  from  two  causes;  the  first  is  from  the  air 
being  deprived  of  heat;  the  second  is  from  the  movement  of  the  air. 
The  air  of  itself  is  cold  and  dry  and  it  is  void  of  all  matter  or  vapours, 
and  it  changes  readily  or  to  put  it  more  exactly  steeps  itself  in  the 
nature  and  image  of  the  things  which  touch  it  and  which  it  has  oppo- 


388  ATMOSPHERE 

site  to  it.  As  regards  things  that  touch  it,  when  a  pungent  thing  such 
as  musk  or  sulphur  or  some  other  powerful  odour  touches  it  it  in- 
stantly permeates  it;  also  if  a  luminous  body  be  placed  within  it  the 
whole  of  the  surrounding  air  will  be  lit  up. 

Now  to  return  to  this  question  of  cold  I  say  that  just  as  the  many 
rays  of  a  concave  mirror  converging  at  one  point  produce  an  extreme 
of  heat  even  so  many  bellows  blowing  on  the  same  point  produce  an 
extreme  cold.  a  20  r. 

[  Concerning  visibility ] 

Men  naturally  if  they  wish  to  know  whether  the  rain  has  com- 
menced look  in  the  air  that  is  between  the  eye  and  some  dark  place; 
and  then  the  fine  threads  which  the  minute  drops  of  water  cause  to 
appear  in  the  air  being  lighted  up  are  easily  visible  against  a  dark 
background.  But  men  reckon  the  threads  which  are  near  at  hand  and 
first  as  though  they  were  the  last  and  almost  touched  the  dark  place, 
not  perceiving  that  this  dark  place  is  sometimes  so  remote  that  it 
would  not  be  possible  to  be  able  to  see  a  neighbouring  tower  there.

The  colours  of  the  middle  of  the  rainbow  mingle  with  each  other. 

The  bow  itself  is  neither  in  the  rain  nor  in  the  eye  that  sees  it,  al- 
though it  is  produced  by  the  rain,  the  sun,  and  the  eye. 

The  rainbow  is  invariably  seen  by  the  eye  which  is  situated  between 
the  rain  and  the  body  of  the  sun,  and  consequently  when  the  sun  is  in 
the  east  and  the  rain  in  the  west  the  rainbow  is  produced  upon  the 
western  rain.  e  cover  1  v. 

OF  THE  POWER  OF  A  VACUUM  FORMED 
INSTANTANEOUSLY 

I  saw  at  Milan  a  thunderbolt  strike  the  Torre  della  Credenza  on  its 
northern  side.  It  travelled  along  it  with  a  slow  movement  and  then  all 
at  once  parted  from  the  tower  and  carried  with  it  and  tore  away  a  part 
of  the  wall,  three  braccia  in  breadth  and  length  and  two  in  depth.  The 
wall  was  four  braccia  in  width  and  was  built  of  old  bricks  which  were 
thin  and  small.  It  was  torn  away  through  the  vacuum  caused  by  the 
flame  of  the  thunderbolt.  I  have  found  traces  of  the  same  power  in  the 


ATMOSPHERE  389 

rocks  of  the  high  Apennines  and  especially  in  the  rock  of  La  Vernia. 
The  same  thing  occurs  with  a  cannon  in  the  vacuum  left  by  the  flame.

OF  THE  WIND 

The  air  moves  like  a  river  and  carries  the  clouds  with  it;  just  as 
running  water  carries  all  the  things  that  float  upon  it.  This  is  proved 
because  if  the  wind  were  to  penetrate  through  the  air  and  drive  the 
clouds  these  clouds  would  be  condensed  between  the  air  and  the  mov- 
ing force  and  would  take  a  lateral  impress  from  the  two  opposing 
extremities,  just  as  wax  does  when  pressed  between  the  fingers. 


OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  AIR 

Air  moves  when  it  is  drawn  away  to  fill  a  vacuum,  or  driven  by  the 
rarefaction  of  the  humidity  of  the  clouds.  g  10  r. 

[Reflex  course  of  wind  and  water] 

The  reflex  wind  as  it  turns  back  upon  its  course  subdues  the  oncom- 
ing wind  until  this  reflex  wind  becomes  enfeebled,  and  then  it  regains 
its  force  when  it  becomes  joined  with  the  falling  movement;  and  such 
power  springs  from  its  condensation  acquired  at  the  place  of  the  per- 
cussions, which  condensation  always  penetrates  into  the  falling  wind 
up  to  the  point  at  which  it  becomes  separated  and  its  speed  of  move- 
ment becomes  less. 

The  water  does  the  same;  not  however  by  condensation  but  because 
it  rises  in  the  air  and  acquires  weight.  g  69  r.

Why  do  the  northern  winds  commence  to  blow  at  the  winter  solstice,

HOW  THE  WIND  THAT  STRIKES  THE  CLOUD  ON  ONE 
SIDE  MAKES  IT  TURN  ROUND 

If  the  wind  strikes  the  cloud  on  one  side  only,  then  although  its 
opposite  side,  that  is  of  the  clouds,  is  in  the  motionless  air,  this  cloud 
will  be  driven  forward  and  turned  round,  and  it  will  make  a  circular 
movement  like  that  of  the  wheel  of  a  mill  turned  by  the  water. 


WHAT  IS  THE  CAUSE  THAT  MAKES  THE  CLOUDS 
INCREASE  THEIR  HEIGHT? 

When  the  movement  of  two  contrary  winds  brings  two  clouds  to 
strike  together  these  clouds  then  become  incorporated  in  each  other, 
and  not  being  able  either  to  expand  or  lower  themselves  because  of  the 
wind  passing  beneath  them,  these  clouds  extend  in  that  direction  in 
which  their  passage  is  least  impeded,  that  is  upwards. 


OF  THE  MEETING  OF  TWO  CLOUDS  MOVING  DIFFERENTLY 
IN  THE  SAME  PATH 

When  with  the  same  wind  two  clouds  meet  together,  the  greater  in 
order  to  have  part  of  the  more  powerful  wind  covers  the  smaller;  and 
the  two  become  condensed  at  their  common  contact,  and  this  causes 
rain.  c  91  v. 

If  the  wind  is  created  by  excess  or  dearth  the  southern  parts  which 
separate  the  humidity  drawn  to  them  come  to  condense  themselves, 
and  not  being  able  to  receive  such  multiplication  they  drive  it  back; 
it  is  then  drawn  by  the  vacuum  created  in  the  cold  region  where  this 
humidity  becomes  contracted  in  forming  clouds,  or  in  the  southern 
parts  where  the  other  clouds  are  formed 


ATMOSPHERE  391 

OF  THE  SWIFTNESS  OF  CLOUDS 

The  course  of  the  cloud  is  less  swift  in  itself  than  its  shadow  which 
moves  over  the  earth.  This  is  proved: — Let  e  be  the  solar  body,  a  the 
cloud,  and  c  its  shadow:  then  as  the  cloud  moves  from  a  to  b  the 
shadow  will  move  from  c  to  d>  from  which  it  follows  that  as  the 
shadows  that  pass  from  the  earth  to  the  cloud  are  made  by  lines  that 
converge  in  the  centre  of  the  sun,,  we  may  say  by  my  fourth  [rule] 
that  what  is  set  forth  is  true,  for  this  fourth  says : — the  equidistant  sec- 
tions at  the  angle  of  the  two  converging  lines  will  be  so  much  less  as 
they  are  nearer  the  place  of  meeting;  therefore  as  the  clouds  are  nearer 
the  sun  than  their  shadow  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  shadow  will 
travel  a  greater  distance  over  the  earth  than  the  cloud  does  through  the 
air  in  the  same  time.  g  92  v.

The  part  of  the  cloud  which  is  nearest  to  the  eye  will  seem  swifter

earth  falling  from  water;  and  you  should  describe  the  equality  of  the 

powers  and  resistances  and  the  shapes  that  they  assume  as  they  pass.

OF  THE  RISING  OF  THE  WIND 

Every  movable  thing  continues  its  movement  in  the  shortest  way 
and  either  shuns  the  obstacle  or  is  bent  by  the  obstacles;  therefore  the 


i92  ATMOSPHERE 

wind  curves  in  penetrating  the  thick  air,  and  bends  upwards  towards 
the  light  air.  k  113  [33]  v. 

OF  WATER  AND  AIR 

Air  that  moves  with  impetus  within  the  other  air  is  compressed 
within  itself  as  is  shown  in  the  expansion  of  the  solar  rays;  for  if  the 
wind  moves  their  atoms  in  various  revolutions  you  see  these  atoms 
form  themselves  into  marbled  waves  after  the  manner  of  watered  silks 
or  camlets  (gianbellotti) ;  and  that  which  you  see  done  to  these  atoms 
is  done  by  the  air  which  bears  them  shut  up  within  itself. 

The  water  in  such  cases  cannot  become  compressed,  and  having  all 
these  like  movements  in  its  body  it  is  necessary  for  it  to  drive  the  other 
water  from  its  place,  so  that  they  may  all  appear  on  the  surface. 

l  78  r. 

When  the  sun  strikes  upon  concave  mirrors  and  leaps  back  from 
them  with  pyramidal  course,  that  part  of  the  pyramid  will  be  propor- 
tionately as  much  warmer  than  its  base  as  it  is  less  in  size,  and  it  does 
so  in  as  much  as  its  moisture  becomes  restricted.  The  hot  steam  which 
is  mingled  with  it  becomes  so  much  more  powerful  as  it  is  more  united, 
and  as  it  is  confined  within  a  less  space  it  generates  more  heat.  Conse- 
quently it  often  catches  fire  and  increases,  forming  itself  into  a  thun- 
derbolt out  of  the  cloud;  and  so  it  bursts  the  cloud  with  devastating 
lightning  and  thunder.  The  little  particles  of  water,  when  the  cloud 
has  been  contracted  by  the  cold,  fasten  themselves  together  and  fall  by 
reason  of  their  weight.  And  in  this  way  the  clouds  break  up,  and  so 
they  return  in  rain  to  the  low  position.  b.m.  57  r. 

The  surfaces  of  transparent  and  polished  bodies  always  mirror  the 
objects  which  look  upon  their  surfaces  and  are  looked  upon  by  them. 

Therefore  that  which  stands  underneath  the  water  is  mirrored  in  the 
surface  of  the  air  which  borders  upon  this  water,  and  that  which  is  in 
the  air  is  mirrored  in  the  surface  of  the  water  which  borders  upon 
this  air.  b.m.  196  r. 

The  course  of  the  winds  changes  and  follows  the  movement  of  some 
other  wind  by  reason  of  the  mouths  of  the  valleys  which  it  enters  and 
issues  forth  from,  and  this  happens  more  with  the  low  winds  than  with 


ATMOSPHERE  393 

the  high  ones,  and  this  it  docs  1mm  its  being  flexible  and  able  to  be 
bent  in  any  direction  except  that  directly  opposite  to  its  course.  And 
desiring  to  move  and  to  give  place  to  the  new  wind  it  has  to  do  as  does 
the  water  that  enters  a  pool  by  a  line  and  then  turns  in  various  chan- 
nels, but  more  by  the  line  that  follows  that  of  the  movement  it  makes 
at  its  entrance,  and  less  by  that  farthest  away  from  this  entrance. 

The  wind  is  condensed  above  the  places  where  it  strikes,  and  more 
in  the  summits  of  the  mountains  than  on  the  sea  coasts  visited  by  it; 
for  there  gather  all  the  reflex  winds,  that  is  on  summits  of  the  straight 
sides  of  the  mountains  where  these  winds  strike;  for  they  do  not  ex- 
tend all  crosswise  following  the  shape  of  the  summit  of  the  mountain, 
but  many  proceed  up  in  a  straight  line  and  especially  those  that  strike 
nearest  the  bases  of  the  mountains,  although  after  they  are  above  the 
summit  of  the  mountain  they  describe  a  curve,  and  after  such  process 
of  curving  straighten  themselves  into  the  course  of  the  other  wind  which 
struck  them  and  which  first  made  them  describe  a  curve.    b.m.  276  r. 


OF  THE  WIND 

Many  are  the  times  when  the  course  of  one  wind  is  diverted  into 
that  of  another,  and  this  arises  from  the  percussion  which  they  make 
at  the  meeting  of  their  courses  when  as  they  are  not  able  to  penetrate 
one  into  the  other  necessity  constrains  them  to  leap  back  in  opposite 
directions. 

If  however  the  said  winds  are  not  of  equal  power  one  with  another 
their  reflex  movements  will  not  follow  the  movement  of  their  striker, 
but  the  angle  of  percussion  of  the  more  powerful  will  be  as  much 
greater  than  that  of  the  less  powerful  as  is  the  excess  of  the  greater 
power  over  the  lesser. 

Winds  which  blow  in  the  same  direction  may  be  simple  or  mixed 
with  other  winds,  that  is  along  one  part  of  its  side  the  wind  may  be  all 
taut  because  the  free  wind  strikes  it  and  leaps  back  at  equal  angles, 
but  never  opposite  to  its  source  because  it  would  have  to  re-enter  into 
itself  and  the  movement  of  two  bodies  cannot  penetrate  within  them- 
selves. Therefore  it  follows  that  the  part  of  the  greater  wind  which  is 
struck  by  the  lesser  wind  would  turn  backwards  and  follow  the  course 
of  the  lesser  wind  which  has  struck  it,  but  it  encounters  it  along  the 


394  ATMOSPHERE 

remainder  of  its  width  and  this  causes  it  to  curve  gradually  until  finally 
it  has  changed  back  to  its  former  course. 

The  same  wind  therefore  in  striking  produces  within  itself  different 
movements  and  different  degrees  of  power,  for  the  part  of  its  breadth 
before  mentioned  which  drives  before  it  the  part  which  flies  away  also 
takes  a  reflex  movement  upon  the  wind  which  it  strikes,  and  so  after 
it  does  the  part  which  when  struck  puts  to  flight  the  second;  and  the 
fourth  which  strikes  the  third  in  such  a  way  that  in  these  parts  it 
becomes  denser.  But  the  first  density  is  greater  than  the  last,  after  the 
manner  of  two  streams  of  water  striking  together,  as  I  have  demon- 
strated in  the  fourth  of  the  seventh  of  the  elements  of  mechanics,  for 
there  is  an  angle  formed  at  the  place  of  the  first  percussion  which 
makes  the  water  that  first  strikes  leap  up  more  than  any  other  part  of  it.

[Movement  of  the  winds] 

If  the  movement  of  the  winds  proceeds  from  Jupiter  the  cause  of 
the  wind  must  be  in  the  twenty-four  hours  during  which  the  move- 
ment of  Jupiter  is  from  the  east  to  the  west  and  not  from  the  north 
to  the  south;  and  this  arises  from  the  fact  that  a  thing  moved  by  some- 
thing else  has  the  form  and  time  of  the  movement  of  its  mover.

QUESTIONS:    THE   MATERIALS   WHICH   PRODUCE   WIND 

If  (the  wind)  is  a  vapour  of  the  earth  and  of  cold  and  dryness,  and 
is  carried  by  heat,  it  rises  to  the  cold  region  of  the  air,  and,  abandoned 
by  heat,  its  conductor,  it  remains  there.  Such  is  the  reason  why  the 
vapour,  being  similar  to  the  vapours  in  that  place,  that  is  to  say  cold 
and  dry,  leaves  the  place  and  vapour,  and  flies  from  its  similar;  and 
this,  indeed,  having  ceased  its  upward  movement  and  entering  a  place 
entirely  similar  to  itself  is  free  to  remain  without  motion.  And  yet  if 
you  concede  it  its  movement,  it  must  still  move  in  the  cold  region  by 
itself.  But  we  shall  say  that  such  a  vapour  being  cold  and  dry  in  its 
slow  and  late  birth,  becomes  successively  mixed  with  the  hot,  and  so 
with  a  gradual  expansion  it  generates  an  almost  imperceptible  motion 
in  proportion  to  this  expansion.  But  the  motion  of  the  heat  which  car- 


ATMOSPHERE  395 

ries  it  upward  is  swift  and  SO  conducts  it  as  far  as  the  cold  region  oi 
the  air,  where,  having  expelled  the  first  part,  the  heat  which  conducts 
it  there  leaves  it  there,  and  so  diminishes  the  vapour,  which  being  with- 
out wind  by  the  same  amount  as  that  of  the  heat  which  was  mixed 
with  it,  being  thus  diminished  in  quantity,  grows  in  weight  above  the 
air  which  sustains  it,  and  so  descends  below  the  other  vapour,  and  hav- 
ing descended  there  the  heat  which  is  divided  from  it  is  reunited  with 
the  heat  and  with  the  other  vapour;  and  this  giving  it  an  upward 
movement  and  so  raising  all  the  vapour  little  by  little  it  chills  the  upper 
part  which  penetrates  the  cold;  and  so  little  by  little  it  falls  back 
through  the  weight  it  has  acquired,  in  such  a  way  that  the  whole  is 
composed  of  a  greater  weight  than  it  was  formerly.  Hence  it  descends 
in  the  form  of  clouds,  and  approaching  the  heat  refracted  by  the  earth 
warmed  by  the  sun,  it  becomes  dissolved  and  dilates  with  great  move- 
ment; and  this  is  the  wind. 

The  winds  descend  from  above  to  below  at  various  angles,  and, 
striking  the  water  or  the  earth,  set  up  lateral  movements  along  various 
lines,  as  does  the  water  which  penetrates  other  water. 

You  say  that  the  movement  of  an  effect  follows  the  movement  of  its 
cause;  and  then  say  that  the  twelve  signs  of  the  Zodiac  are  the  cause  of 
the  motion  of  winds,  and  that  the  three  fiery  signs,  the  Ram,  the  Lion 
and  the  Archer  are  of  the  east  and  move  the  eastern  winds;  and  that 
the  three  cold  and  dry  signs,  the  Bull,  the  Virgin  and  the  Goat  move 
the  southern  winds,  and  the  other  three  signs  move  the  western  winds. 
This  theory  leaves  the  inventor  of  such  causes  in  confusion  from  the 
first  proposition  which  you  agreed  on,  viz.  that  all  bodies  in  motion 
follow  the  movement  of  their  motive  force.  Now  these  signs  of  the 
Zodiac  are  moving  from  east  to  west  and  go  round  the  world  in  twenty- 
four  hours.  How  then  do  you  account  for  the  fact  that  these  signs 
which  move  towards  the  west  will  move  the  western  winds;  and  yet 
these  winds  should  move  towards  the  east  which  would  be  contrary  to 
the  motion  of  their  motive  force?  This  is  contrary  to  your  first  assump- 
tion, which  is  true,  but  your  consequent  theory  is  false. 

You  say  that  the  vapour  which  generates  the  wind  is  carried  upwards 
by  heat  and  pressed  down  again  by  cold;  which  having  been  said,  it 
follows  in  course  that  this  vapour,  finding  itself  between  two  contrary 
motions,  escapes  to  the  sides;  and  this  lateral  movement  is  the  wind, 


396  ATMOSPHERE 

which  has  a  tortuous  movement  because  it  cannot  descend  to  the  earth 
because  the  heat  pushes  it  up,  and  it  cannot  move  very  high  up  because 
the  cold  presses  it  down;  hence  this  necessity  gives  it  a  latitudinal  and 
tortuous  movement.  Now  many  drawbacks  will  follow  from  this  the- 
ory of  yours,  of  which  the  first  is  that  the  wind  will  never  descend  to 
the  plain,  and  secondly  that  the  cold  in  being  driven  down  by  such  a 
vapour  would  be  acting  contrary  to  its  inert  nature. 

Windsor:  Drawings  12671  r. 

Then  again,  it  is  possible  that  the  vapour  which  collects  in  the  cold 
region,  through  being  abandoned  by  the  heat  which  conducts  it  there, 
comes  to  be  compressed  and  makes  itself  larger  (heavier?);  and  the 
air  which  formerly  sustained  it  no  longer  resists  it,  and  in  consequence 
gives  place  to  it;  and  this  vapour  being  heavy  descends  rapidly  into 
the  hot  region  near  to  the  earth.  There  it  is  entirely  permeated  with 
heat  and  in  consequence  completely  dilated  and  resolved,  and  moves 
in  every  direction  which  is  round  about  it,  and  strikes  the  sea  on  its 
surface.  And  here  one  can  see  the  cause  of  the  origin  of  such  wind  as 
makes  the  movement  of  the  sea,  for  it  is  flying  from  the  first  place  it 
struck.  And  in  this  cause  (case?)  the  courses  of  the  parts  of  this  wind 
are  not  parallel  because  they  move  from  the  centre  to  the  circumference 
in  direct  lines. 

The  congregation  of  humidity  scattered  through  the  air,  which  comes 
together  for  the  creation  of  clouds,  creates  wind  in  the  air.  And  simi- 
larly the  breaking  up  of  the  clouds  makes  the  fine  and  penetrable 
humidity  through  the  air;  and  this  is  the  wind.  The  proof:  one  may 
see  the  water  churned  up  on  a  fire  which  makes  a  wind  in  the  chimney 
that  is  above  this  fire;  and  again,  boiling  water  which  is  shut  into  vases 
escapes  through  little  vents  of  such  a  vase  with  great  force  in  the  man- 
ner of  wind.  And  again,  fires  made  in  small  rooms  suck  in  the  air 
through  little  cracks  in  the  windows  with  great  force  and  noise. 

Windsor:  Drawings  12671  v. 

The  force  inherent  in  moving  bodies  has  the  result  that  movement 
is  often  contrary  to  the  nature  of  the  thing  moved. 

You  say  that  the  vapour  of  the  wind  is  driven  up  by  the  heat  which 
lifts  it  and  is  then  pushed  down  again  by  the  cold  which  joins  with 


ATMOSPHERE  397 

it;  and  yet  necessity  gives  it  a  lateral  and  a  curved  movement,  since 
being  enclosed  between  two  contrary  forces  it  flies  out  sideways  all 
over  the  earth. 

But  this  theory  denies  that  the  vapour  which  has  been  mixed  in  the 
cold  region  of  the  air  is  pushed  down  by  this  cold,  because  it  is  neces- 
sary to  say  either  that  the  vapour  flies  before  the  cold  from  its  nature, 
or  that  the  cold  really  removes  it  of  itself,  which  is  being  contrary  to 
the  nature  of  the  vapour.  And  if  such  a  vapour  moves  of  itself,  it  does 
so  after  it  has  increased  and  not  before,  because  at  first  it  is  the  power 
of  the  heat  pressing  it  down  which  makes  itself  greater  than  the  power 
of  the  vapour  which  wishes  to  descend.  Here  it  must  be  confessed  that 
such  a  vapour  in  increasing  acquires  weight,  and  that  with  this  weight 
it  overcomes  the  force  of  the  heat  which  sustains  it,  and  that  here  cold 
does  not  press  it  down  because,  if  it  were  natural  to  such  cold  to  press 
it  down,  it  would  have  been  easier  to  expel  it  when  the  vapour  was 
small  in  quantity  and  weak  than  when  it  was  increased  in  quantity  and 
in  force.  And  so  here  we  shall  say  that  the  vapour  of  the  wind,  having 
reached  the  cold  region,  stops  there,  because  the  heat  which  has  con- 
ducted it  to  this  place  becomes  consumed  in  cold;  and  the  heat  being 
consumed  the  vapour  remains  without  motive  force,  and  so  it  stays 
there  and  awaits  the  parts  which  succeed  and  adjoin  it.  And  these  not 
being  at  such  an  altitude  are  not  yet  completely  deprived  of  heat  and 
in  consequence  of  movement;  and  so  not  being  stationary  they  move 
until  at  last  they  arrive  at  the  same  altitude  as  the  part  which  has  been 
chilled  and  they  penetrate  this  and  unite  with  it,  and  the  heat  being 
there  condensed  leaves  it  [the  vapour].  And  so  subsequently  rising, 
one  part  after  the  other,  and  penetrating  the  higher  part,  they  are  pre- 
vented from  condensing,  and  from  that  weight  of  such  a  nature  that 
the  lower  region  cannot  sustain  it  above  itself.  Hence  by  necessity  it 
descends  united  with  it  until  the  heat  makes  it  light  and  again  lifts  it 
upwards,  and  does  the  same  as  it  did  the  first  time,  and  so  once  more 
joining  with  the  cold  part  it  again  acquires  weight  and  again  sinks 
down  and  again  turns  to  vapour  in  the  upper  air.  And  so  this  would 
go  on  continually  and  from  this  arises  the  motion  of  the  wind  spread- 
ing itself  from  high  to  low  and  not  from  here  to  there  [vertically  and 
not  horizontally].  Well  then  this  theory  given  above  is  false,  because 
experience  shows  itself  in  disagreement. 


398  ATMOSPHERE 

You  say  that  the  winds  begin  by  being  weak  and  go  on  growing  in 
strength,  because  in  the  beginning  there  was  a  small  quantity  of  vapour 
generated  by  a  small  blast;  but  when  such  a  vapour  was  increased  in 
a  greater  quantity,  being  struck  by  the  cold,  it  descends  with  greater 
force  and  from  this  arises  the  growth  of  wind.  To  this  we  answer  that 
any  movement  is  born  of  a  void  or  a  deficiency.  If  vapour  which  is 
raised  by  the  heat,  which  though  it  penetrates  the  said  heat,  dissolves 
such  a  vapour  and  makes  a  movement  sideways  or  rather  upwards 
because  that  is  the  true  [direction]  of  the  movement  of  fire,  and  when, 
the  more  this  evaporation  rises  the  more  it  is  pressed  in,  its  exterior 
moves  itself  inwards  towards  the  centre  of  the  bulk.  And  this  second 
movement  is  contrary  to  the  first,  because  the  first  moved  from  the 
centre  to  the  extremities  and  the  second  movement  is  from  the  ex- 
tremities to  the  centre,  and  from  one  to  the  other  the  movement  is  more 
rapid  in  proportion  as  it  is  more  remote  from  the  centre,  because  the 
extremities  are  more  affected  by  heat  and  cold  than  are  the  parts  which 
are  near  the  middle.  But  to  return  to  the  matter  in  hand;  the  more  the 
vapour  rises  the  more  it  is  pressed  in  because  it  grows  nearer  to  the 
cold,  the  exact  opposite  of  the  heat  which  conducts  such  a  vapour  and 
presses  it  in. 

This  cannot  make  wind  which  flows  from  it,  but  can  make  it  if  it 
runs  contrary  to  it  because  it  does  not  allow  a  vacuum,  and  the  place 
from  whence  its  parts  are  flying  would  remain  a  vacuum  if  the  air  did 
not  fill  them  up,  and  this  air  rushes  to  fill  up  [the  vacuum]  with  the 
same  speed  as  the  vapour  when  it  is  rushing  away  from  the  cold.  And 
since  the  material  joined  with  the  motive  force  which  moves  it,  moves 
itself  in  the  same  amount  of  time  as  the  movement  made  by  this  motive 
force,  therefore  here  the  vapour  will  move  itself  in  such  time  as  the  fire, 
its  first  motive  force,  accompanies  it,  and  when  the  fire  is  parted  from 
it  the  vapour  loses  its  movement  which  [movement]  the  cold  does  not 
give  it  if  it  is  not  against  the  half  of  its  quantity  (?),  or  it  may  be  that 
that  part  of  the  vapour  which  touches  the  cold  first  of  all  is  the  first  to 
rush  backwards  towards  the  centre,  but  one  cannot  classify  this  as 
actual  flight  but  as  the  loss  of  its  elevation. 

You  say  that  the  wind  does  not  blow  continuously,  but  with  various 
gusts  divided  one  from  the  other;  and  the  cause  of  this  is  the  vapour 
which  rises  to  the  cold  carried  by  heat  in  various  quantities.  Here  one 


ATMOSPHERE  399 

may  answer  that  the  cold  does  not  expel  the  vapour  but  (that  this  is 
produced);  but  that  the  heat  which  is  escaping  from  the  cold  brings 
back  the  vapour  which  it  formerly  carried  with  it  to  the  cold  regions. 
And  again  one  may  say  that  the  heat,  in  the  first  contact  which  it 
makes  with  the  cold,  warms  this  cold  in  proportion  as  it  touches  it 
[the  cold];  and  similarly  the  cold  chills  the  heat  in  proportion  as  it 
receives  it  [the  heat]  into  itself.  Hence  there  arises  a  storm;  which  has 
the  result  that  the  heat  and  cold  lose  some  of  their  original  force;  and 
in  this  case  the  way  is  prepared  for  the  transformation  into  vapour 
which  succeeds,  together  with  the  heat,  in  penetrating  more  deeply  into 
the  cold  and  warming  it  to  a  greater  altitude.  And  so  the  vapour  pene- 
trates farther  in  such  a  way  that  it  passes  through  the  cold  region  and 
penetrates  towards  the  element  of  fire  [the  source  of  heat];  and  being 
united  with  it  the  vapour  makes  a  great  outburst  through  all  the  sur- 
rounding regions,  which  outbursts  are  rapid  movements  in  direct  lines 
and  result  in  a  flood  of  air  which  [strikes]  the  sea  above  the  horizon 
and  proves  to  be  the  cause  of  your  solution.

OF  THE  COLOUR  OF  THE  ATMOSPHERE 

I  say  that  the  blue  which  is  seen  in  the  atmosphere  is  not  its  own 
colour,  but  is  caused  by  the  heated  moisture  having  evaporated  into 
the  most  minute  imperceptible  particles,  which  the  beams  of  the  solar 
rays  attract  and  cause  to  seem  luminous  against  the  deep  intense  dark- 
ness of  the  region  of  fire  that  forms  a  covering  above  them.  And  this 
may  be  seen,  as  I  myself  saw  it,  by  anyone  who  ascends  Mon  Boso 
(Monte  Rosa),  a  peak  of  the  chain  of  Alps  that  divides  France  from 
Italy,  at  whose  base  spring  the  four  rivers  which  flow  as  many  different 
ways  and  water  all  Europe,  and  there  is  no  other  mountain  that  has 
its  base  at  so  great  an  elevation. 

This  mountain  towers  to  so  great  a  height  as  almost  to  pass  above  all 
the  clouds;  and  snow  seldom  falls  there,  but  only  hail  in  summer  when 
me  clouds  are  at  their  greatest  height;  and  there  this  hail  accumulates, 
so  that  if  it  were  not  for  the  infrequency  *  of  the  clouds  thus  rising  and 

1MS.  has  reta  which  Dr.  Richter  reads  in  sense  of  'malanno'.  I  have  adopted  Dr. 
Solmi's  suggestion  'rarita'.    (Note,  Dec.   1929.  Calvi  reads    [rajreta.) 


4oo  ATMOSPHERE 

discharging  themselves,  which  does  not  happen  twice  in  an  age,  there 
would  be  an  enormous  mass  of  ice  there,  built  up  by  the  various  layers 
of  the  hail;  and  this  I  found  very  thick  in  the  middle  of  July.  And  I 
saw  the  atmosphere  dark  overhead,  and  the  rays  of  the  sun  striking 
the  mountain  had  far  more  brightness  than  in  the  plains  below,  be- 
cause less  thickness  of  atmosphere  lay  between  the  summit  of  this 
mountain  and  the  sun. 

As  a  further  example  of  the  colour  of  the  atmosphere,  we  may  take 
the  case  of  the  smoke  produced  by  old  dry  wood,  for  as  it  comes  out 
of  the  chimneys  it  seems  to  be  a  pronounced  blue  when  seen  between 
the  eye  and  a  dark  space,  but  as  it  rises  higher  and  comes  between  the 
eye  and  the  luminous  atmosphere,  it  turns  immediately  to  an  ashen 
grey  hue,  and  this  comes  to  pass  because  it  no  longer  has  darkness 
beyond  it,  but  in  place  of  this  the  luminous  atmosphere.  But  if  this 
smoke  comes  from  new  green  wood,  then  it  will  not  assume  a  blue 
colour,  because,  as  it  is  not  transparent,  and  is  heavily  charged  with 
moisture,  it  will  have  the  effect  of  a  dense  cloud  which  takes  definite 
lights  and  shadows  as  though  it  were  a  solid  body. 

The  same  is  true  of  the  atmosphere,  which  excessive  moisture  renders 
white,  while  little  moisture  acted  upon  by  heat  causes  it  to  be  dark 
and  of  a  dark  blue  colour;  and  this  is  sufficient  as  regards  the  defini- 
tion of  the  colour  of  the  atmosphere,  although  one  may  also  say  that  if 
the  atmosphere  had  this  transparent  blue  as  its  natural  colour,  it  would 
follow  that  wherever  a  greater  quantity  of  atmosphere  came  between 
the  eye  and  the  fiery  element,  it  would  appear  of  a  deeper  shade  of 
blue,  as  is  seen  with  blue  glass  and  with  sapphires,  which  appear 
darker  in  proportion  as  they  are  thicker.  The  atmosphere,  under  these 
conditions,  acts  in  exactly  the  opposite  way,  since  where  a  greater 
quantity  of  it  comes  between  the  eye  and  the  sphere  of  fire,  there  it  is 
seen  much  whiter,  and  this  happens  towards  the  horizon;  and  in 
proportion  as  a  lesser  amount  of  atmosphere  comes  between  the  eye 
and  the  sphere  of  fire,  of  so  much  the  deeper  blue  does  it  appear,  even 
when  we  are  in  the  low  plains.  It  follows  therefore,  from  what  I  say, 
that  the  atmosphere  acquires  its  blueness  from  the  particles  of  mois- 
ture which  catch  the  luminous  rays  of  the  sun. 

We  may  also  observe  the  difference  between  the  atoms  of  dust  and 
those  of  smoke  seen  in  the  sun's  rays  as  they  pass  through  the  chinks 


ATMOSPHERE  401 

of  the  walls  in  dark  rooms,  that  the  one  seems  the  colour  of  ashes,  and 
the  other — the  thin  smoke — seems  of  a  most  beautiful  blue.  We  may 
see  also  in  the  dark  shadows  of  mountains  far  from  the  eye  that  the 
atmosphere  which  is  between  the  eye  and  these  shadows  will  appear 
very  blue,  and  in  the  portion  of  these  mountains  which  is  in  light,  it 
will  not  vary  much  from  its  first  colour. 

But  whoever  would  see  a  final  proof,  should  stain  a  board  with 
various  different  colours,  among  which  he  should  include  a  very 
strong  black,  and  then  over  them  all  he  should  lay  a  thin  transparent 
white,  and  he  will  then  perceive  that  the  lustre  of  the  white  will 
nowhere  display  a  more  beautiful  blue  than  over  the  black, — but  it 
must  be  very  thin  and  finely  ground.  Leic.  4  r. 

Smoke  is  swift  at  its  beginning  and  becomes  slower  at  every  stage  of 
its  ascent,  because  it  becomes  colder  and  heavier,  owing  to  the  fact 
that  a  great  part  of  it  is  condensed  through  the  parts  striking  against 
each  other  and  being  pressed  together  and  made  to  adhere  one  to  an- 
other; and  water  does  the  same  for  it  is  swift  at  the  beginning  of  its 
movement.  Leic.  12  v. 

Air  even  if  it  changes  its  position  preserves  the  impression  of  its 
eddies  more  than  water  does,  from  the  fact  of  it  being  swifter  and 
thinner.  Leic.  30  v. 

An  excess  of  smoke  acts  as  a  veil,  a  small  quantity  of  it  does  not 
render  the  perfection  of  this  blue:  it  is  by  a  moderate  admixture  of 
smoke  therefore  that  the  beautiful  blue  is  created. 

Experience  it  is  that  shows  how  the  air  has  darkness  behind  it  and 
yet  appears  blue. 

Make  smoke  of  dry  wood  in  a  small  quantity;  let  the  rays  of  the 
sun  fall  upon  this  smoke,  and  behind  it  place  a  piece  of  black  velvet, 
so  that  it  shall  be  in  shadow.  You  will  then  see  that  all  the  smoke 
which  comes  between  the  eye  and  the  darkness  of  the  velvet  will  show 
itself  of  a  very  beautiful  blue  colour;  and  if  instead  of  the  velvet  you 
put  a  white  cloth,  the  smoke  will  become  the  colour  of  ashes. 

How  water  blown  in  the  form  of  spray  into  a  dark  place,  through 
which  the  solar  rays  pass,  produces  this  blue  ray;  and  especially  when 
this  water  has  been  distilled;  and  how  the  thin  smoke  becomes  blue. 


4o2  ATMOSPHERE 

This  is  said  in  order  to  show  how  the  blue  colour  of  the  atmosphere 
is  caused  by  the  darkness  that  is  above  it;  and  the  above-mentioned 
instances  are  offered  for  the  benefit  of  anyone  who  cannot  confirm 
my  experience  on  Mon  Boso.1  Leic.  36  r.

7  have  divided  the  "Treatise  on  Birds"  into  jour 
boohj;  of  which  the  first  treats  of  their  flight  by 
beating  their  wings;  the  second  of  flight  without 
beating  their  wings  and  with  the  help  of  the  wind; 
the  third  of  flight  in  general,  such  as  that  of  birds, 
bats,  fishes,  animals  and  insects;  the  last  of  the 
mechanism  of  this  movement.' 

Those  feathers  which  are  farthest  away  from  their  points  of  attach- 
ment will  be  most  flexible. 

The  tips  of  the  feathers  of  the  wings  therefore  will  always  be  higher 
than  their  roots,  wherefore  we  may  with  reason  say  that  the  bones  of 
the  wings  will  always  be  lower  when  the  wing  is  lowered  than  any 
part  of  the  wing;  and  when  it  is  raised  these  bones  of  the  wing  will  be 
higher  than  any  part  of  this  wing.  Because  the  heavier  part  will  al- 
ways be  the  guide  of  the  movement. 

I  ask  in  what  part  of  the  under  surface  of  the  breadth  of  the  wing 
does  this  wing  press  the  air  more  than  in  any  part  of  the  length  of  the 
wings. 

Every  body  that  does  not  bend,  although  these  are  each  in  itself  of 
different  size  and  weight,  will  throw  equal  weights  upon  all  the  sup- 
ports which  are  equidistant  from  their  centre  of  gravity,  this  centre 
being  in  the  middle  of  the  breadth  of  this  body. 

But  if  the  said  body  is  flexible  with  varying  thicknesses  and  weights, 
although  the  centre  of  gravity  may  be  in  the  centre  of  its  magnitude, 
this  will  not  prevent  the  support  that  is  nearest  the  centre  of  its 
gravity,  or  of  other  inequality  of  gravity,  from  being  more  charged 
with  weight  than  that  which  is  above  the  lighter  parts.

that  his  centre  of  gravity  and  that  of  his  machine  may  oscillate  and 
change  where  necessity  requires  through  a  change  in  the  centre  of  its 
resistance. 

When  the  bird  desires  to  turn  to  the  right  or  left  side  by  beating  its 
wings,  it  will  beat  lower  with  the  wing  on  the  side  on  which  it  wishes 
to  turn,  and  thus  the  bird  will  twist  its  movement  behind  the  impetus 
of  the  wing  which  moves  most,  Sul  Volo  6  [5]  r. 

and  makes  the  reflex  movement  under  the  wind  from  the  opposite  side. 

When  the  bird  desires  to  rise  by  beating  its  wings  it  raises  its  shoul- 
ders and  beats  the  tips  of  the  wings  towards  itself,  and  comes  to 
condense  the  air  which  is  interposed  between  the  points  of  the  wings 
and  the  breast  of  the  bird,  and  the  pressure  from  this  air  raises  up 
the  bird. 

The  kite  and  the  other  birds  which  beat  their  wings  only  a  little,  go 
in  search  of  the  current  of  the  wind;  and  when  the  wind  is  blowing  at 
a  height  they  may  be  seen  at  a  great  elevation,  but  if  it  is  blowing  low 
down  then  they  remain  low. 

When  there  is  no  wind  stirring  in  the  air  then  the  kite  beats  its 
wings  more  rapidly  in  its  flight,  in  such  a  way  that  it  rises  to  a  height 
and  acquires  an  impetus;  with  which  impetus,  dropping  then  very 
gradually,  it  can  travel  for  a  great  distance  without  moving  its  wings. 

And  when  it  has  descended  it  does  the  same  over  again,  and  so  con- 
tinues for  many  times  in  succession. 

This  method  of  descending  without  moving  the  wings  serves  it  as  a 
means  of  resting  in  the  air  after  the  fatigue  of  the  above-mentioned 
beating  of  the  wings. 

All  the  birds-  which  fly  in  spurts  rise  to  a  height  by  beating  their 
wings;  and  during  their  descent  they  proceed  to  rest  themselves,  for 
while  descending  they  do  not  beat  their  wings.    Sul  Volo  6  [5]  v. 

OF  THE  FOUR  REFLEX  AND  FALLING  MOVEMENTS  MADE  BY 
BIRDS  UNDER  DIFFERENT  CONDITIONS  OF  THE  WIND 

The  slanting  descent  of  birds  made  against  the  wind  will  always  be 
made  beneath  the  wind,  and  their  reflex  movement  will  be  made  upon 
the  wind. 


FLIGHT  405 

But  if  this  falling  movement  is  made  to  the  cast  when  the  wind  is 
blowing  from  the  north  then  the  north  wing  will  remain  under  the 
wind  and  it  will  do  the  same  in  the  reflex  movement,  wherefore  at 
the  end  of  this  reflex  movement  the  bird  will  find  itself  with  its  front 
to  the  north. 

And  if  the  bird  descends  to  the  south  while  the  wind  is  blowing  from 
the  north  it  will  make  this  descent  upon  the  wind,  and  its  reflex  move- 
ment will  be  below  the  wind;  but  this  is  a  vexed  question  which  shall 
be  discussed  in  its  proper  place  for  here  it  would  seem  that  it  could 
not  make  the  reflex  movement. 

When  the  bird  makes  its  reflex  movement  facing  and  upon  the  wind 
it  will  rise  much  more  than  its  natural  impetus  requires,  seeing  that 
it  is  also  helped  by  the  wind  which  enters  underneath  it  and  plays  the 
part  of  a  wedge.  But  when  it  is  at  the  end  of  its  ascent  it  will  have 
used  up  its  impetus  and  therefore  will  depend  upon  the  help  of  the 
wind,  which  as  it  strikes  it  on  the  breast  would  throw  it  over  if  it 
were  not  that  it  lowers  the  right  or  left  wing>  for  this  will  cause  it  to 
turn  to  the  right  or  left  dropping  down  in  a  half  circle. 

Sui  Volo  7  [6]  r. 

[Of  a  flying  machine] 

The  movement  of  the  bird  ought  always  to  be  above  the  clouds  so 
that  the  wing  may  not  be  wetted,  and  in  order  to  survey  more  country 
and  to  escape  the  danger  caused  by  the  revolutions  of  the  winds  among 
the  mountain  defiles  which  are  always  full  of  gusts  and  eddies  of 
winds.  And  if  moreover  the  bird  should  be  overturned  you  will  have 
plenty  of  time  to  turn  it  back  again  following  the  instructions  I  have 
given,  before  it  falls  down  again  to  the  ground. 

If  the  point  of  the  wing  is  struck  by  the  wind  and  the  wind  enters 
underneath  the  point  the  bird  will  then  find  itself  liable  to  be  over- 
turned unless  it  employs  one  of  two  remedies;  that  is  either  it  suddenly 
enters  with  this  point  under  the  wind  or  lowers  the  opposite  wing 
from  the  middle  forward. 

(Figure)  abed  are  the  four  cords  above  for  raising  the  wing,  and 
they  are  as  powerful  in  action  as  the  cords  below,  e  f  g  h,  because  of 
the  bird  being  overturned  so  that  they  may  offer  as  much  resistance 
above  as  they  do  below,  although  a  single  strip  of  hide  dressed  with 


406  FLIGHT 

alum  thick  and  large  may  chance  to  suffice:  but  finally  however  we 
must  put  it  to  the  test.  Sul  Volo  7  [6]  v. 

The  bird  I  have  described  ought  to  be  able  by  the  help  of  the  wind 
to  rise  to  a  great  height,  and  this  will  prove  to  be  its  safety;  since  even 
if  all  the  above-mentioned  revolutions  were  to  befall  it,  it  would  still 
have  time  to  regain  a  condition  of  equilibrium;  provided  that  its  vari- 
ous parts  have  a  great  power  of  resistance,  so  that  they  can  safely 
withstand  the  fury  and  violence  of  the  descent,  by  the  aid  of  the 
defences  which  I  have  mentioned;  and  its  joints  should  be  made  of 
strong  tanned  hide,  and  sewn  with  cords  of  very  strong  raw  silk.  And 
let  no  one  encumber  himself  with  iron  bands,  for  these  are  very  soon 
broken  at  the  joints  or  else  they  become  worn  out,  and  consequently 
it  is  well  not  to  encumber  one's  self  with  them. 

The  cord  a  set  for  the  purpose  of  extending  the  wing  ought  to  be  of 
thick  dressed  hide,  so  that  if  the  bird  should  be  turned  upside  down  it 
may  be  able  to  subdue  the  fury  of  the  wind  which  strikes  it  on  the 
wing  and  seeks  to  close  it,  for  this  would  be  the  cause  of  the  de- 
struction of  the  bird.  But  to  make  it  more  safe  you  should  make 
exactly  the  same  system  of  cords  outside  as  within,  and  you  will  then 
avoid  all  suspicion  of  danger. 

a  b  c  are  the  terminating  points  of  the  cords  from  the  three  joints  of 
the  fingers  of  the  wings;  d  marks  the  position  of  the  mover  of  the 
lever  a  d  which  moves  the  wing.  Sul  Volo  8  [7]  r. 

When  the  edge  of  the  point  of  the  wing  meets  the  edge  of  the  wind 
for  a  brief  moment  this  wing  sets  it  either  below  or  above  this  edge 
of  the  wind,  and  the  same  happens  with  the  point  and  sides  of  the 
tail  and  in  like  manner  with  the  helms  of  the  shoulders  of  the  wings. 

The  descent  of  the  bird  will  always  be  by  that  extremity  which  is 
nearest  to  its  centre  of  gravity. 

The  heaviest  part  of  the  bird  which  descends  will  always  be  in 
front  of  the  centre  of  its  bulk. 

3rd.  When  without  the  help  of  the  wind  the  bird  is  stationary  in  the 
air  without  beating  its  wings  in  a  position  of  equilibrium,  this  shows 
that  its  centre  of  gravity  is  identical  with  the  centre  of  its  bulk. 

4th.  The  heaviest  part  of  the  bird  which  descends  head  foremost 
will  never  remain  above  or  level  with  the  height  of  its  lightest  part. 


FLIGHT  407 

If  the  bird  falls  with  its  tail  downwards  by  throwing  its  tail  back- 
wards it  will  regain  a  position  of  equilibrium,  and  if  it  throws  it  for- 
wards it  will  come  to  turn  right  over. 

1st.  When  the  bird  being  in  a  state  of  equilibrium  sends  the  centre 
of  resistance  of  its  wings  behind  its  centre  of  gravity  it  will  descend 
with  its  head  below. 

2nd.  And  this  bird  which  is  in  a  state  of  equilibrium  will  have  the 
centre  of  resistance  of  its  wings  in  front  of  its  centre  of  gravity;  this 
bird  will  then  drop  with  the  tail  turned  to  the  ground.1 

Sul  Volo  8  [7]  v. 

If  the  wing  and  the  tail  are  too  far  above  the  wind  lower  half  the 
opposite  wing  and  so  get  the  impact  of  the  wind  there  within  it,  and 
this  will  cause  it  to  right  itself. 

If  the  wing  and  the  tail  should  be  beneath  the  wind  raise  the  op- 
posite wing  and  it  will  right  itself  as  you  desire,  provided  that  this 
wing  which  rises  slants  less  than  the  one  opposite  to  it. 

And  if  the  wing  and  the  breast  are  above  the  wind  it  should  lower 
the  half  of  the  opposite  wing,  and  this  will  be  struck  by  the  wind  and 
thrown  back  upwards,  and  this  will  cause  the  bird  to  right  itself. 

But  if  the  wing  and  the  spine  are  below  the  wind  it  ought  then  to 
raise  the  opposite  wing  and  expand  it  in  the  wind,  and  the  bird  will 
immediately  right  itself. 

And  if  the  bird  is  situated  with  the  hinder  part  above  the  wind  the 
tail  ought  then  to  be  placed  beneath  the  wind,  and  thus  there  will  be 
brought  about  an  equilibrium  of  forces. 

But  if  the  bird  should  have  its  hinder  parts  below  the  wind  {raising 
its  tail 2)  it  should  enter  with  its  tail  above  the  wind  and  it  will  right 
itself.  Sul  Volo  9 ■  [8]  r. 

When  the  bird  is  above  the  wind,  turning  its  bill  with  its  trunk  to 
the  wind  the  bird  would  be  liable  to  be  overturned  unless  it  lowered  its 
tail  and  received  in  it  a  great  volume  of  wind;  and  if  it  acts  thus  it  is 
impossible  for  it  to  be  overturned.  This  is  proved  by  the  first  section 

1  The  odd  order  of  the  numbered  paragraphs  here  and  elsewhere  in  the  MSS.  sug- 
gests that  the  numbers  may  have  been  added  with  the  intention  of  amending  the  order

of  the  Elements  of  Mechanics,  which  shows  how  things  in  equilibrium 
which  are  struck  outside  their  centre  of  gravity  send  down  the  op- 
posite sides  which  are  situated  on  this  side  of  the  aforesaid  centre.  .  .  . 


(Example) 

And  if  the  bird  is  situated  with  its  length  under  the  wind  it  is  liable 
to  be  thrown  upside  down  by  the  wind  unless  it  instantly  raises  up  its 
tail.  .  .  . 

How  the  expanse  of  the  wing  is  not  all  used  in  compressing  the  air; 
and  for  the  truth  of  this  see  how  the  openings  between  the  chief 
feathers  are  much  wider  spaces  than  the  actual  breadth  of  the  feathers. 

You  therefore  who  make  research  into  winged  creatures  do  not  take 
into  your  reckoning  the  whole  expanse  of  the  wing,  and  note  the 
different  characteristics  of  the  wings  of  all  winged  creatures. 

Sul  Volo  9  [8]  v. 

When  the  wind  strikes  the  bird  under  its  course  from  its  centre  of 
gravity  towards  this  wind  then  the  bird  will  turn  with  its  spine  to- 
wards the  wind;  and  if  the  wind  was  more  powerful  below  than  above 
the  bird  would  be  turned  upside  down  if  it  were  not  instantly  alert  to 
draw  to  itself  the  lower  and  stretch  out  the  upper  wing;  and  by  this 
means  it  rights  itself  and  returns  to  the  position  of  equilibrium. 

This  is  proved  thus: — let  a  c  be  the  wing  folded  up  beneath  the  bird, 
and  a  b  the  wing  extended;  I  say  that  the  forces  of  the  wind  which 
strike  the  two  wings  will  have  the  same  proportion  as  that  of  their 
extension,  that  is  a  b  as  against  a  c.  It  is  true  that  c  is  wider  than  b, 
but  it  is  so  near  the  bird's  centre  of  gravity  that  it  offers  small  resist- 
ance in  comparison  with  b. 

But  when  the  bird  is  struck  under  the  wind,  beneath  one  of  its 
wings,  it  would  be  possible  for  the  wind  to  overturn  it  if  it  were  not 
that  so  soon  as  ever  it  is  turned  with  its  breast  to  the  wind  it  extended 
the  opposite  wing  towards  the  ground,  and  drew  up  the  wing  which 
was  first  struck  by  the  wind  which  remains  uppermost,  and  thus  it 
will  come  to  return  to  a  position  of  equilibrium.  This  is  proved  by  the 
fourth  of  the  third  according  to  which  that  object  is  more  mastered 
which  is  opposed  by  a  greater  force;  also  by  the  fifth  of  the  third 


FLIGHT  409 

which  is  that  this  support  resists  less  and  is  situated  farther  away  from 
its  fixed  point;  also  by  the  fourth  of  the  third:  among  winds  of  equal 
force  that  will  be  of  greater  force  which  is  of  greater  volume,  and  that 
will  strike  with  a  greater  volume  which  finds  a  greater  object;  where- 
fore m  f  being  longer  than  m  n,  m  f  will  obey  the  wind. 

Sul  Volo  10  [9]  r. 

If  the  bird  should  wish  to  turn  itself  rapidly  on  one  of  its  sides  and 
to  follow  its  circular  movement  it  will  beat  its  wings  twice  on  that 
side,  moving  the  wing  back  like  an  oar  and  keeping  the  other  wing 
steady  or  making  only  one  beat  with  this  as  against  two  of  the  op- 
posite wing. 

Since  the  wings  are  swifter  to  press  the  air  than  the  air  is  to  escape 
from  beneath  the  wings  the  air  becomes  condensed  and  resists  the 
movement  of  the  wings;  and  the  motive  power  of  these  wings  by  sub- 
duing the  resistance  of  the  air  raises  itself  in  a  contrary  movement  to 
the  movement  of  the  wings. 

That  bird  will  descend  with  the  swifter  movement  when  its  descent 
is  at  a  less  angle. 

The  descent  of  a  bird  will  be  at  a  less  angle  when  the  tips  of  the 
wings  and  their  shoulders  are  nearer  together. 

The  lines  of  the  movements  made  by  birds  as  they  rise  are  of  two 
kinds,  of  which  one  is  always  spiral  in  the  manner  of  a  screw,  and  the 
other  is  rectilinear  and  curved. 

That  bird  will  rise  up  to  a  height  which  by  means  of  a  circular 
movement  in  the  shape  of  a  screw  makes  its  reflex  movement  against 
the  coming  of  the  wind  and  against  the  flight  of  this  wind,  turning 
always  upon  its  right  or  left  side. 

Thus  if  the  north  wind  should  be  blowing,  and  you  coming  above 
in  reflex  movement,  should  glide  against  the  said  wind,  until,  in  this 
straight  process  of  rising,  the  wind  was  in  such  a  condition  that  it 
might  turn  you  over,  you  are  then  at  liberty  to  bend  with  the  right 
or  left  wing,  and  holding  the  inner  wing  low  you  will  pursue  a  curv- 
ing movement,  with  the  help  of  the  tail,  curving  in  the  direction  of  the 
lower  wing,  and  continually  descending  and  pivoting  round  the  wing 
that  is  held  low,  until  you  again  make  the  reflex  movement  anew 
above  the  wind,  behind  the  course  of  the  wind;  and  when  you  are 


4io  FLIGHT 

on  the  point  of  being  turned  over  this  same  lower  wing  will  curve 
your  line  of  movement,  and  you  will  return  against  the  wind,  under- 
neath it,  until  you  have  acquired  the  impetus,  and  then  raise  yourself 
above  the  wind,  facing  its  approach,  and  by  means  of  the  already 
acquired  impetus,  you  will  make  the  reflex  movement  greater  than 
the  falling  movement. 

A  bird  as  it  rises  always  sets  its  wings  above  the  wind  and  without 
beating  them,  and  it  always  moves  in  a  circular  movement. 

And  if  you  wish  to  go  to  the  west  without  beating  your  wings,  when 
the  north  wind  is  blowing,  make  the  falling  movement  straight  and 
beneath  the  wind  to  the  west,  and  the  reflex  movement  above  the 
wind  to  the  north.  Sul  Volo  (f.m.)  ii  [io]  r. 

A  bird  makes  the  same  use  of  wings  and  tail  in  the  air  as  a  swimmer 
does  of  his  arms  and  legs  in  the  water. 

If  a  man  is  swimming  with  his  arms  equally  towards  the  east,  and 
his  body  exactly  faces  the  east,  the  swimmer's  movement  will  be  to- 
wards the  east.  But  if  the  northern  arm  is  making  a  longer  stroke  than 
the  southern  arm  then  the  movement  of  his  body  will  be  to  the  north- 
east. And  if  the  right  arm  is  making  a  longer  movement  than  the  left 
the  man's  movement  will  be  to  the  south-east. 

The  impetus  of  one  of  the  wings  extended  edgewise  towards  the 
tail  will  occasion  the  bird  a  sudden  circling  movement  following  on 
the  impetus  of  the  above-mentioned  wing. 

When  the  bird  raises  itself  in  circles  to  a  height  above  the  wind, 
without  beating  its  wings,  by  the  force  of  the  wind,  it  will  be  trans- 
ported by  this  wind  out  of  the  region  where  it  desires  to  return,  still 
without  beating  its  wings;  then  it  turns  so  that  it  faces  the  approach 
of  the  wind,  entering  slantwise  underneath  this  wind,  and  comes  tc 
descend  slightly  until  it  finds  itself  above  the  spot  where  it  desires 
to  return. 

The  edge  a  of  the  helm  of  the  wing  or  the  thumb  (dito  grosso)  of 
the  hand  of  the  bird  b  a  is  that  which  sets  the  shoulder  of  the  wing 
immediately  below  or  above  the  wind.  And  if  this  shoulder  did  not 
have  the  power  of  cutting  with  a  keen  and  strong  edge,  the  wing 
would  not  be  able  suddenly  to  enter  below  or  above  the  wind  when 
it  happened  to  be  necessary  for  the  bird,  seeing  that  if  this  shoulder 


FLIGHT  411 

were  round,  and  the  wind  /  e  were  to  strike  the  wing  below  and  it 
should  immediately  befall  the  wing  to  be  .  .  . 

Sul  Volo  (f.m.)  11  [10]  v. 

.  .  .  struck  from  above,  the  power  of  the  wind  which  strikes  it  from 
above  is  not  at  its  full  strength,  seeing  that  the  wedge  of  the  wind 
which  is  separated  from  the  middle  of  the  shoulder  downwards  raises 
the  wing  up  almost  with  the  same  power  as  that  exerted  by  the  wind 
above  to  send  the  wing  downwards. 

But  if  the  wind  strikes  the  bird  on  the  right  or  left  wing,  it  is  neces- 
sary for  it  to  enter  below  or  above  this  wind,  with  the  point  of  the 
wing  struck  by  this  wind,  and  this  change  occupies  as  much  space  as 
the  thickness  of  the  points  of  these  wings.  As  this  change  is  beneath 
the  wind  the  bird  turns  with  its  bill  to  the  wind,  and  if  it  is  above  the 
wind  the  bird  will  turn  with  its  tail  as  it  pleases;  and  here  arises 
the  danger  of  the  bird  being  turned  upside  down,  if  nature  had  not 
provided  for  this  by  placing  the  weight  of  the  body  of  this  bird  lower 
than  the  position  of  the  extension  of  the  wings,  as  will  be  shown  here. 

Sul  Volo  10  [9]  v. 

When  the  bird  flies  by  beating  its  wings  it  does  not  extend  its  wings 
wholly,  because  the  points  of  the  wings  would  be  too  far  removed 
from  the  lever  and  cords  which  move  them. 

If  as  the  bird  descends  it  moves  its  wings  back  as  though  they  were 
oars  the  bird  will  make  swift  movement;  and  this  comes  about  because 
the  wings  are  striking  in  the  air  which  is  continually  flowing  in  the 
wake  of  the  bird  to  fill  up  the  void  from  whence  it  has  departed.

TO  ESCAPE  THE  DANGER  OF  DESTRUCTION 

The  destruction  of  these  machines  may  come  about  in  two  ways, 
the  first  of  which  is  when  the  machine  breaks,  the  second  is  when  it 
turns  edgewise  or  almost  on  its  edge  because  it  ought  always  to  de- 
scend with  a  long  slant  and  almost  in  a  level  line. 

As  regards  the  preventing  of  the  machine  from  being  broken  one 
may  guard  against  this  by  making  it  as  strong  as  possible  in  whatever 


4i2  FLIGHT 

line  it  may  turn,  that  is  either  edgewise  falling  with  head  or  tail  in 
front,  or  with  the  point  of  the  right  or  left  wing,  or  along  lines  that 
bisect  or  are  the  quarterings  of  these  lines  as  the  sketch  shows  [figure] 
against  this  by  turning  almost  edgewise  one  ought  at  the  outset  to 
guard. 

As  regards  constructing  the  machine  in  such  a  way  that  in  descend- 
ing whatever  may  be  the  direction  that  it  takes  it  finds  the  remedy 
prepared;  and  this  you  will  do  by  causing  its  centre  of  gravity  to  be 
above  that  of  the  weight  which  it  carries,  always  in  a  vertical  line, 
and  the  one  always  at  a  sufficient  distance  from  the  other,  that  is  that 
if  the  machine  is  thirty  braccia  in  width  the  centres  are  four  braccia 
apart,  and  as  has  been  said  one  is  beneath  the  other,  and  the  heavier 
is  below  because  as  it  descends  the  heavier  part  always  constitutes 
itself  in  part  the  guide  of  the  movement.  In  addition  to  this  if  the 
bird  wishes  to  fall  with  its  head  downwards  with  a  fraction  of  the 
slant  that  would  cause  it  to  turn  over  this  will  not  be  able  to  happen, 
because  the  lighter  part  would  be  beneath  the  heavier  and  the  light 
would  be  descending  before  the  heavy,  which  is  impossible  in  a  descent 
of  any  length,  as  is  proved  in  the  fourth  of  the  Elements  of  Mechanics. 

And  if  the  bird  should  fall  head  downwards  with  the  body  partly 
slanting  towards  the  ground  the  underneath  sides  of  the  wings  ought 
to  turn  flat  against  the  earth,  and  the  tail  to  rise  towards  the  back,  and 
the  head  or  the  underpart  of  the  jaw  is  also  turned  towards  the  ground, 
and  from  this  there  will  immediately  originate  in  this  bird  its  reflex 
movement  which  will  cast  it  up  again  towards  the  sky;  for  which 
reason  the  bird  at  the  close  of  its  reflex  movement  will  come  to  fall 
back  unless  it  should  while  rising  lower  one  of  its  wings  slightly,  which 
would  curve  such  movement  and  cause  it  to  turn  into  a  half  circle; 
then  this  bird  will  find  itself  at  the  close  of  this  movement  with  its 
bill  turned  to  the  spot  at  which  this  reflex  movement  started.  And  if 
this  is  done  against  the  course  of  the  wind  the  end  of  the  reflex  move- 
ment will  be  much  higher  than  was  the  commencement  of  the  falling 
movement.  And  this  is  the  way  in  which  the  bird  rises  up  to  a  height 
without  beating  its  wings  and  circling.  And  the  remainder  of  the 
circle  of  which  I  have  spoken  is  completed  by  the  help  of  the  wind,  by 
a  falling  movement,  with  one  of  the  wings  always  kept  low  and 
similarly  one  side  of  the  tail.  And  it  subsequently  makes  a  reflex 


FLIGHT  413 

movement  towards  the  direction  of  the  wind  and  is  left  at  the  end 
with  its  bill  turned  in  the  direction  of  the  wind,  and  then  makes  again 
the  falling  and  reflex  movements  against  the  wind  always  going  in 
circles. 

When  the  bird  wishes  suddenly  to  turn  on  one  of  its  sides  it  pushes 
out  swiftly  towards  its  tail,  the  point  of  the  wing  on  that  side,  and  since 
every  movement  tends  to  maintain  itself,  or  rather  every  body  that  is 
moved  continues  to  move  so  long  as  the  impression  of  the  force  of  its 
mover  is  retained  in  it,  therefore  the  movement  of  this  wing  with 
violence,  in  the  direction  of  the  tail,  keeping  still  at  its  termination  a 
portion  of  the  said  impression,  not  being  able  of  itself  to  follow  the 
movement  which  has  already  been  commenced,  will  come  to  move 
the  whole  bird  with  it  until  the  impetus  of  the  moved  air  has  been 
consumed. 

When  the  tail  is  thrust  forward  with  its  face  and  the  wind  strikes 
upon  it  it  makes  the  bird  move  suddenly  in  an  opposite  direction. 

Sul  Volo  13  [12]  r.  and  v. 

[With  drawing  of  bird  with  wings  outstretched} 

Here  the  big  fingers  of  the  wings  are  those  which  keep  the  bird 
motionless  in  the  air  against  the  movement  of  the  wind;  that  is  the 
wind  moves,  and  it  maintains  itself  upon  it  without  beating  its  wings, 
and  the  bird  does  not  change  its  position. 

The  reason  is  that  the  bird  arranges  its  wings  so  as  to  slant  so  much 
that  the  wind  which  strikes  it  below  does  not  form  itself  into  a  wedge 
of  such  a  kind  as  tends  to  raise  it,  raising  it  however  just  so  much  as 
its  weight  wishes  to  lower  it,  that  is  to  say  if  the  bird's  impulse  to  fall 
be  expressed  by  two  units  of  power  the  wind's  impulse  to  rise  will  be 
expressed  by  two  units  also,  and  because  things  which  are  equal  can- 
not overcome  one  another  the  bird  remains  in  its  position  without 
either  rising  or  falling.  It  remains  for  us  to  speak  of  the  motion  which 
does  not  impel  it  either  forward  or  backward;  and  that  is  if  the  wind 
should  wish  to  accompany  it  or  drive  it  out  of  its  position  with  a 
power  expressed  by  four  units  and  the  bird  with  the  same  power  is 
slanting  at  the  same  angle  against  the  wind.  Here  also  as  the  powers 
are  equal  the  bird  will  not  move  forward  nor  will  it  be  driven  back 
when  the  wind  is  equal.  But  inasmuch  as  the  movements  and  powers 


4M  FLIGHT 

of  the  winds  are  variable  the  angle  of  the  wings  ought  not  to  change, 
because  if  the  wind  grows  and  it  should  alter  the  angle  in  order  not 
to  be  driven  upward  by  this  wind.  .  .  . 

In  the  aforesaid  instances  the  wind  does  not  enter  like  a  wedge 
underneath  the  slanting  wings,  but  only  meets  the  wing  along  the 
edge  which  wishes  to  descend  against  the  wind;  and  there  strikes  it  on 
the  edge  of  the  shoulder  which  serves  as  a  shield  for  all  the  rest  of  the 
wing;  and  there  would  be  here  no  protection  against  the  descent  of  the 
wing  if  it  were  not  for  the  big  finger  a  which  then  comes  to  the  front 
and  receives  the  whole  force  of  the  wind  full  upon  it,  or  less  than  full 
according  to  the  greater  or  less  power  of  the  wind. 

Sul  Volo  14  [13]  r. 

[With  drawing  of  wing] 

The  big  finger  n  of  the  hand  m  n  is  that  which  when  the  hand  is 
lowered  comes  to  lower  itself  more  than  the  hand,  in  such  a  way  as  to 
close  and  prevent  the  exit  of  the  stream  of  air  compressed  by  the  lower- 
ing of  the  hand,  in  such  a  way  that  in  this  place  the  air  becomes 
condensed  and  offers  resistance  to  the  oarage  of  the  wing.  And  for  this 
reason  nature  has  formed  in  this  big  finger  a  bone  of  such  great 
strength,  to  which  are  united  very  strong  sinews  with  the  feathers 
short  and  of  greater  strength  than  the  feathers  which  are  on  birds' 
wings,  because  the  bird  leans  upon  it,  upon  the  air  which  is  already 
compressed,  with  all  the  power  of  the  wing  and  of  its  strength,  be- 
cause it  is  this  by  means  of  which  the  bird  moves  forward. 

And  this  finger  here  performs  for  the  wings  the  function  which  its 
claws  do  for  a  cat  when  it  climbs  up  trees. 

But  when  the  wing  regains  fresh  force  with  its  return  upward  and 
forward,  the  big  finger  of  the  wing  then  puts  itself  in  a  straight  line 
with  the  other  fingers,  and  thus  with  its  sharp  edge  it  strikes  the 
air  and  performs  the  office  of  a  helm  or  rudder,  which  strikes  the  air 
continually  in  some  movement  high  or  low  when  the  bird  wishes  to 
rise. 

The  second  helm  or  rudder  is  placed  on  the  opposite  side  beyond 
the  bird's  centre  of  gravity,  and  this  is  its  tail,  which  if  it  is  struck  by 
the  wind  below,  through  being  beyond  the  aforesaid  centre  will  come 
to  lower  the  bird  in  its  front  part. 


FLIGHT  415 

But  if  the  tail  is  struck  above,  the  bird  is  raised  in  its  front  part. 
And  if  the  tail  is  somewhat  twisted,  and  shows  its  front  slanting  under 
the  right  wing,  the  front  part  of  the  bird  will  be  turned  towards  the 
right  side.  And  if  the  slant  of  the  lower  side  of  the  tail  is  turned  to  the 
left  wing,  it  will  turn  with  its  front  part  to  the  left  side;  and  in  each 
of  the  two  conditions  the  bird  will  descend.  But  if  the  tail  in  a  slant- 
ing position  is  struck  by  the  wind  in  its  upper  part  the  bird  will  turn 
revolving  slowly  on  that  side  on  which  the  upper  surface  of  the  tail 
shows  its  slant.  Sul  Volo  14  [13]  v. 

The  axis  of  the  shoulder  of  birds  is  that  which  is  turned  by  the 
muscles  of  the  breast  and  back;  and  it  is  here  that  the  discretion  of 
lowering  or  raising  the  tail  originates  according  to  the  will  or  necessity 
of  the  animal  that  moves. 

I  conclude  that  the  rising  of  birds  without  beating  their  wings  is 
not  produced  by  anything  other  than  their  circular  movement  amid 
the  movement  of  the  wind,  which  movement  when  it  ceases  to  have 
the  support  of  the  wind  continues  to  descend  as  far  as  the  place  at 
which  the  reflex  movement  starts,  after  which,  and  having  thus  re- 
volving described  a  semicircle  it  finds  itself  again  with  its  face  turned 
to  the  wind,  and  follows  the  reflex  movement,  above  the  wind,  con- 
tinually revolving  until  with  the  help  of  the  wind  it  makes  its  highest 
ascent  between  its  lowest  descent  and  the  arrival  of  the  wind,  and  re- 
mains with  its  left  wing  to  the  wind;  and  from  this  maximum  eleva- 
tion circling  anew  it  drops  again  to  the  last  falling  movement,  re- 
maining with  its  right  wing  to  the  wind. 

The  equal  power  of  resistance  of  a  bird's  wings  is  always  due  to  the 
fact  of  their  being  equally  remote  in  their  extremities  from  the  bird's 
centre  of  gravity. 

But  when  one  of  the  extremities  of  the  wings  is  nearer  the  bird's 
centre  of  gravity  than  the  other  the  bird  will  then  descend  on  the 
side  on  which  the  extremity  of  the  wing  is  nearer  to  the  centre  of 
gravity.  Sul  Volo  15  [14]  r. 

The  hand  of  the  wing  is  the  part  that  causes  the  impetus;  and  the 
elbow  is  then  held  edgewise  in  order  not  to  check  the  movement  which 
creates  the  impetus;  and  when  this  impetus  is  afterwards  created  the 


416  FLIGHT 

elbow  is  lowered  and  set  slantwise  and  in  slanting  it  makes  the  air 
upon  which  it  rests  almost  into  the  form  of  a  wedge,  upon  which  the 
wing  comes  to  raise  itself,  and  if  it  did  not  do  thus  the  movement  of 
the  bird  during  the  time  that  the  wing  returns  forward  would  cause 
the  bird  to  fall  as  the  impetus  gradually  becomes  consumed;  but  it  is 
not  able  to  fall  because  as  the  impetus  fails  so  in  proportion  does  the 
pressure  exerted  by  the  elbow  resist  the  descent  and  again  raise  the 
bird  up. 

The  elbows  of  the  creature  are  not  lowered  quite  at  the  commence- 
ment, because  in  the  chief  flight  of  the  impetus  the  bird  will  bound 
upwards,  but  they  are  lowered  by  as  much  as  may  be  necessary  to 
check  the  descent,  according  to  the  desire  and  discretion  of  the  bird. 

When  the  bird  wishes  to  soar  upwards  suddenly  it  immediately 
lowers  its  elbows,  after  it  has  produced  the  impetus. 

But  if  it  wishes  to  descend  it  keeps  its  elbows  rigid  and  raised  up 
after  the  creation  of  the  impetus.  Sul  Volo  15  [14]  v. 

Remember  that  your  bird  should  have  no  other  model  than  the  bat, 
because  its  membranes  serve  as  an  armour  or  rather  as  a  means  of 
binding  together  the  pieces  of  its  armour,  that  is  the  framework  of 
the  wings. 

And  if  you  take  as  your  pattern  the  wings  of  feathered  birds,  these 
are  more  powerful  in  structure  of  bone  and  sinew  because  they  are 
penetrable,  that  is  to  say  the  feathers  are  separated  from  one  another 
and  the  air  passes  through  them.  But  the  bat  is  aided  by  its  mem- 
brane, which  binds  the  whole  together  and  is  not  penetrated  by  the 
air. 

OF  THE  METHOD  OF  BALANCING  ONESELF 

It  will  always  be  the  heaviest  part  of  bodies  which  constitutes  itself 
the  guide  of  their  movement. 

The  bird  which  has  to  raise  itself  without  beating  its  wings  sets 
itself  so  that  it  slants  against  the  wind,  presenting  its  wings  to  it  with 
the  elbows  in  front,  with  its  centre  of  gravity  more  towards  the  wind 
than  the  centre  of  the  wings.  Whence  it  comes  about  that  if  the  power 
which  impels  the  bird  when  slanting  to  descend  is  represented  by  two

and  the  force  with  which  the  wind  strikes  it  by  three  the  movement 
obeys  the  three  and  not  the  two.  Sul  Volo  16  [15]  r. 

[With  drawing  of  pulley  with  bird  suspended  with  wings  outstretched] 

This  is  made  in  order  to  find  the  bird's  centre  of  gravity,  and  with- 
out this  instrument  this  machine  would  have  little  value. 

When  the  bird  drops  down  its  centre  of  gravity  is  outside  the  centre 
of  its  resistance. 

And  if  the  bird  wishes  to  raise  itself  its  centre  of  gravity  remains 
behind  the  centre  of  its  resistance. 

The  bird  can  stay  poised  in  the  air  without  keeping  its  wings  in  a 
position  of  equality  because  owing  to  its  not  having  the  centre  of 
gravity  in  the  middle  of  its  axis  as  balances  have,  it  is  not  necessarily 
obliged  to  keep  its  wings  at  an  equal  height  like  the  said  balances. 
But  if  these  wings  are  outside  this  position  of  equality  the  bird  will 
descend  by  the  line  of  the  slant  of  the  wings.  And  if  the  slant  is  com- 
plex, that  is  double,  as  if  we  say  that  the  slant  of  the  wings  points  to 
the  south,  and  the  slant  of  the  head  and  tail  points  to  the  east,  then 
the  bird  will  descend  slanting  towards  the  south-east.  And  if  the  slant 
of  the  bird  is  double  the  slant  of  its  wings  the  bird  will  descend  by  a 
line  midway  between  the  south-east  and  the  east,  and  the  slant  of  its 
movement  will  be  between  the  two  positions  that  have  been  men- 
tioned. Sul  Volo  16  [15]  v. 


AN  ARGUMENT  TO  DISPOSE  OF  THE  OBJECTIONS 
TO  THE  ATTEMPT 

You  will  perhaps  say  that  the  sinews  and  muscles  of  a  bird  are 
incomparably  more  powerful  than  those  of  man,  because  all  the  girth 
of  so  many  muscles  and  of  the  fleshy  parts  of  the  breast  goes  to  aid  and 
increase  the  movement  of  the  wings,  while  the  bone  in  the  breast  is  all 
in  one  piece  and  consequently  affords  the  bird  very  great  power,  the 
wings  also  being  all  covered  with  a  network  of  thick  sinews  and  other 
very  strong  ligaments  of  gristle,  and  the  skin  being  very  thick  with 
various  muscles. 

But  the  reply  to  this  is  that  such  great  strength  gives  it  a  reserve  of 
power  beyond  what  it  ordinarily  uses  to  support  itself  on  its  wings, 


418  FLIGHT 

since  it  is  necessary  for  it  whenever  it  may  so  desire  either  to  double 
or  treble  its  rate  of  speed  in  order  to  escape  from  its  pursuer  or  to  fol- 
low its  prey.  Consequently  in  such  a  case  it  becomes  necessary  for  it 
to  put  forth  double  or  treble  the  amount  of  efTort,  and  in  addition  to 
this  to  carry  through  the  air  in  its  talons  a  weight  corresponding  to 
its  own  weight.  So  one  sees  a  falcon  carrying  a  duck  and  an  eagle 
carrying  a  hare;  which  circumstance  shows  clearly  enough  where  the 
excess  of  strength  is  spent;  for  they  need  but  little  force  in  order  to 
sustain  themselves,  and  to  balance  themselves  on  their  wings,  and  flap 
them  in  the  pathway  of  the  wind  and  so  direct  the  course  of  their 
journeyings;  and  a  slight  movement  of  the  wings  is  sufficient  for 
this,  and  the  movement  will  be  slower  in  proportion  as  the  bird  is 
greater  in  size. 

Man  is  also  possessed  of  a  greater  amount  of  strength  in  his  legs 
than  is  required  by  his  weight.  And  in  order  to  show  the  truth  of  this, 
place  a  man  to  stand  upon  the  sea-shore,  and  observe  how  far  the 
marks  of  his  feet  sink  in;  and  then  set  another  man  on  his  back,  and 
you  will  see  how  much  deeper  the  marks  of  his  feet  will  be.  Then 
take  away  the  man  from  his  back,  and  set  him  to  jump  straight  up 
as  high  as  he  can;  you  will  then  find  that  the  marks  of  his  feet  make 
a  deeper  impression  where  he  has  jumped  than  where  he  has  had  the 
other  man  on  his  back.  This  affords  us  a  double  proof  that  man  is 
possessed  of  more  than  twice  the  amount  of  strength  that  is  required 
to  enable  him  to  support  himself.  [With  drawing]  Leather  bags  with

Since  the  wings  have  to  row  downwards  and  backwards,  in  order  to 
keep  the  machine  up  and  so  that  it  may  progress  forward,  it  moves  by 
the  lever  c  d  with  a  slanting  track,  guided  by  the  strap  a  b.

which  in  addition  to  its  ordinary  i unction  pulled  down  the  lever  /. 
But  this  would  not  serve  our  purpose,  because  it  is  necessary  that  the 
lever  /  should  first  rise  or  descend  before  the  stirrup  g  moves  from  its 
place,  in  order  that  the  wing — as  it  throws  itself  forward  and  raises 
itself  up  at  the  time  at  which  the  already  acquired  impetus  of  itself 
drives  the  bird  forward  without  it  beating  its  wings — can  present  it- 
self edgewise  to  the  air,  because  if  it  did  not  do  this  the  surface  of  the 
wings  would  clash  upon  the  air,  would  hinder  its  movement,  and 
would  not  allow  the  impetus  to  carry  the  bird  forward. 

Sul  Volo  17  [16]  v. 

If  the  bird  drops  to  the  east  with  its  right  wing  extended  above  the 
south  wind  then  undoubtedly  it  will  be  turned  over  unless  it  suddenly 
turns  its  bill  to  the  north;  and  then  the  wind  will  strike  the  palms  of 
its  hands  beyond  the  centre  of  its  gravity  and  will  raise  up  again  the 
part  of  the  bird  which  is  in  front. 

When  the  bird  has  great  breadth  of  wings  and  a  small  tail  and  wishes 
to  raise  itself  up  it  will  raise  its  wings  vigorously  and  will  in  turning 
receive  the  wind  under  its  wings;  this  wind  forming  itself  into  a  wedge 
will  drive  it  up  to  a  height  with  swiftness  as  is  the  case  with  the 
cortone,  a  bird  of  prey  which  I  saw  going  to  Fiesole  above  the  place  o£ 
the  Barbiga  in  5  (the  year  1505)  on  the  fourteenth  day  of  March. 

Movements  of  the  tail:  how  sometimes  it  is  flat  and  the  bird  as  it 
moves  has  it  in  a  level  position;  sometimes  it  has  the  extremities 
equally  low  and  it  is  then  that  the  bird  rises;  sometimes  it  has  the  ex- 
tremities equally  high  and  this  occurs  when  it  descends.  But  when 
the  tail  is  low  and  the  left  side  is  lower  than  the  right  the  bird  will 
then  rise  with  a  circling  movement  towards  the  right  side;  this  may- 
be proved  but  not  here.  And  if  when  the  tail  is  low  the  right  extremity 
is  lower  than  the  left  the  bird  will  turn  towards  the  left  side.  And  if 
when  the  tail  is  high  the  left  side  of  its  extremities  is  higher  than  the 
right  the  bird  will  then  turn  with  its  head  towards  the  right  side;  but 
if  when  the  tail  is  high  the  right  side  of  its  extremities  is  higher  than 
the  left  then  the  bird  will  circle  towards  the  left  side.

[With  drawings  of  birds'  wings] 

Always  in  raising  the  hand  the  elbow  is  lowered  and  presses  the  air, 


42o  FLIGHT 

and  as  this  hand  is  lowered  the  elbow  rises  and  remains  edgewise,  in 
order  not  to  check  the  movement  by  means  of  the  air  which  would 
strike  into  it. 

The  lowering  of  the  tail  at  the  time  that  the  bird  sends  its  wings 
forward  again  edgewise  a  little  above  the  wind,  guided  by  the  impetus 
already  acquired,  is  the  reason  why  the  wind  strikes  under  this  elbow 
and  forms  itself  into  a  wedge,  upon  which  the  bird  proceeds  to  rise 
with  the  aforesaid  impetus  without  beating  its  wings. 

And  if  the  bird  be  three  pounds  and  the  breast  a  third  the  width  of 
the  wings  the  wings  will  only  bear  two  thirds  of  the  bird's  weight. 

The  hand  feels  great  fatigue  towards  the  thumb  or  rather  the  helm 
of  the  wing  because  this  is  the  part  that  strikes  the  air. 

The  palm  of  the  hand  goes  from  a  to  b  always  between  almost  equal 
angles,  dropping  and  pressing  the  air,  and  at  b  it  turns  immediately 
edgewise  and  goes  backwards,  rising  by  the  line  c  d,  and  having  arrived 
at  d  it  turns  suddenly  opposite  and  goes  dropping  by  the  line  a  b,  and 
as  it  turns  it  always  turns  round  the  centre  of  its  breadth. 

The  turning  of  the  hand  backwards  edgewise  will  be  done  with  great 
rapidity,  and  the  pressing  of  it  backwards  open  will  be  done  with  such 
rapidity  as  the  final  urge  of  the  motive  power  requires. 

The  course  of  the  point  of  the  fingers  is  not  the  same  in  going  as  in 
coming  back  but  it  follows  a  higher  line  in  returning;  and  beneath  this 
is  the  figure  made  by  the  higher  and  lower  line,  and  it  is  oval  with  a 
long  and  regular  curve.  Sul  Volo  18  r. 

The  great  bird  will  take  its  first  flight  upon  the  back  of  the  great 
swan,  filling  the  whole  world  with  amazement  and  filling  all  records 
with  its  fame;  and  it  will  bring  eternal  glory  to  the  nest  where  it 
was  born.  Sul  Volo,  cover,  2  r. 

1505  on  the  evening  of  Tuesday  the  fourteenth  day  of  April  Lorenzo 
came  to  live  with  me :  he  said  that  he  was  seventeen  years  of  age. 

And  on  the  fifteenth  day  of  this  April  I  had  twenty-five  gold  florins 
from  the  treasurer  of  Santa  Maria  Nuova. 

From  the  mountain  which  takes  its  name  from  the  great  bird,  the 


FLIGHT  421 

famous  bird  will  take  its  flight,  which  will  fill  the  world  with  its  great 
renown.1  Sul  Volo  18  v. 

If  the  bird  wishes  to  make  headway  against  the  wind  it  beats  its 
wings  and  moves  them  as  oars  backwards.  c.a.  37  r.  h 

Unless  the  bird  beats  its  wings  downwards  with  more  rapidity  than 
there  would  be  in  its  natural  descent  with  its  wings  extended  in  the 
same  position,  its  movement  will  be  downwards.  But  if  the  movement 
of  the  wings  is  swifter  than  the  aforesaid  natural  descent  then  this 
movement  will  be  upwards,  with  so  much  greater  velocity  in  propor- 
tion as  the  downward  stroke  of  the  wings  is  more  rapid. 

The  bird  descends  on  that  side  on  which  the  extremity  of  the  wing  is 
nearer  to  the  centre  of  its  gravity. 

You  will  make  an  anatomy  of  the  wings  of  a  bird  together  with  the 
muscles  of  the  breast  which  are  the  movers  of  these  wings. 

And  you  will  do  the  same  for  a  man,  in  order  to  show  the  possibility 
that  there  is  in  man  who  desires  to  sustain  himself  amid  the  air  by  the 
beating  of  wings.  c.a.  45  r.  a 

[  With  figures] 

The  bird  which  descends  above  or  below  the  wind  keeps  its  wings 
closed  in  order  not  to  be  held  up  or  checked  by  the  air;  it  keeps  them 
well  above  its  body,  so  that  it  may  not  be  turned  upside  down  by  the 
impetus. 

When  the  bird  keeps  the  shoulders  of  its  wings  closed  and  their 
points  wide  it  makes  the  air  thicker  than  the  other  air  where  it  does 
not  pass;  and  it  does  this  in  order  to  check  its  movement  and  not  devi- 
ate from  the  line  of  this  movement. 

xThis  passage  should  be  regarded  as  a  key  to  the  one  before  it.  In  the  phrase  'sopra 
del  dosso  del  suo  magnio  cecero',  'upon  the  back  of  the  great  swan',  Leonardo  was  ap- 
parently referring  to  Monte  Ceccri,  the  mountain  above  Fiesole  immediately  to  the 
south.  It  was  from  the  summit  or  from  a  ridge  of  this  mountain  that  he  intended  to 
make  a  trial  of  his  flying  machine.  The  locality  is  also  referred  to  in  another  page  of 
the  same  manuscript  where  he  speaks  of  'the  cortone  a  bird  of  prey  which  I  saw  going 
to  Fiesole  above  the  place  of  the  Barbiga  in  the  year  1505  on  the  fourteenth  day  of  March' 
(Sul  Volo,  Fogli  Mancanti  18  [17]  v.).  This  points  to  the  probability  that  1505  was 
the  year  in  which  the  trial  took  place.  It  may  have  been  this  trial  of  which  Cardan 
chronicled  the  ill  success. 


422  FLIGHT 

But  when  the  bird  opens  the  shoulders  more  than  the  points  of  its 
wings  it  wishes  to  delay  the  movement  more  forcibly. 

When  the  points  and  the  shoulders  of  the  wings  are  equally  near  to 
each  other  the  bird  wishes  to  descend  without  being  checked  by  the  air. 

When  the  bird  uses  its  wings  as  oars,  or  beats  the  wings  backwards 
in  their  descent,  it  is  a  clear  sign  that  it  increases  the  speed  of  its 
descent. 

Here  by  means  of  the  attitudes  of  the  birds  one  sees  the  results  of  the 
effects  and  both  of  these  joined  together  show  the  intention  of  the  bird. 

The  wing  extended  on  one  side  and  drawn  up  on  the  other  show  the 
bird  dropping  with  a  circular  movement  round  the  wing  that  is  drawn 
up. 

Wings  drawn  up  equally  show  that  the  bird  wishes  to  descend  in  a 
straight  line. 

The  bird  above  the  wind  at  the  end  of  the  reflex  movement  will 
never  keep  its  wings  open  equally,  because  it  would  be  turned  upside 
down  by  the  wind.  But  it  draws  that  wing  in  to  itself  round  which  it 
desires  to  make  the  revolving  movement,  and  descends  behind  it  and 
moves  in  a  circle  behind  it,  when  it  wishes  to  rise  or  descend. 

The  opponent  says  that  he  has  seen  the  proofs  of  how  the  bird 
standing  with  its  wings  entirely  open  cannot  descend  perpendicularly 
to  its  own  hurt  or  the  damage  of  any  part,  and  that  he  admits  the 
proofs  that  it  cannot  fall  backwards  edgewise  because  he  cannot  deny 
the  proofs  assigned,  and  also  it  cannot  fall  with  its  head  below  it;  but 
that  he  doubts  whether  if  it  should  find  itself  with  the  line  of  the 
breadth  of  the  wings  perpendicular  to  the  ground  it  would  not  descend 
edgewise  along  this  line.  Here  the  reply  is  that  in  this  case  the  heaviest 
part  of  the  bodies  would  not  be  a  guide  of  the  movement,  and  such 
movement  would  be  contrary  to  the  fourth  of  this,  which  was  proved 
to  be  impossible.  c.a.  66  r.  a 

The  rudders  of  the  wings  of  birds  are  the  parts  which  immediately 
place  the  bird  above  or  below  the  coming  of  the  wind,  and  with  their 
tiny  movement  cleave  the  air  in  whatever  line  along  the  opening  of 
which  the  bird  can  then  penetrate  with  ease. 

The  bird  will  never  descend  backwards  because  its  centre  of  gravity 
is  nearer  to  the  head  than  towards  the  tail. 


FLIGHT  423 

The  descent  of  the  bird  in  all  or  part  of  its  movement  will  always  be 
along  that  line  in  which  its  centre  of  gravity  is  nearest  to  the  extremi- 
ties of  the  width  of  the  bird. 

I  have  said  the  descent  will  be  entirely  towards  that  part  which  is 
nearest  to  the  centre  of  gravity  when  one  part  only  is  near  to  this  centre 
of  gravity,  and  the  extremities  of  the  other  opposite  parts  remain  equi- 
distant from  this  centre;  as  when  the  bird  presses  its  head  close  in  to  its 
body  and  the  wings  remain  equally  distant  from  the  centre  tail  straight 
and  wide,  the  bird  will  then  descend  with  its  head  in  front,  and  the 
body  in  its  central  line  will  direct  itself  by.  this  movement. 

But  when  in  such  movement  one  of  the  wings  narrows  itself  towards 
the  said  centre  the  line  of  the  bird's  descent  will  be  between  the 
gathered-in  wing  and  the  head  of  the  bird. 

And  if  during  the  movement  of  the  wings,  when  opened  equally,  the 
tail  should  bend  towards  one  of  the  wings,  the  movement  will  then 
continue  between  the  head  of  the  bird  and  the  opposite  wing. 

And  if  the  head  only  is  bent  down  towards  one  of  the  .wings  open 
equally,  the  slanting  descent  will  then  proceed  between  the  head  and 
the  wing  which  the  head  is  near. 

Swimming  upon  water  teaches  men  how  birds  do  upon  the  air. 

c.a.  66  r.  b 


HOW  THE  BIRD  STOPS  ON  THE  WING  ABOVE  THE  WIND 
AND  DOES  NOT  MOVE  FROM  ITS  POSITION 

If  the  wind  which  drives  the  bird  forward  is  of  the  same  power  as 
the  bird,  that  stays  above  the  wind  and  desires  to  drop  towards  this 
wind,  the  bird  will  then  be  motionless;  and  the  movement  which  it  was 
on  the  point  of  making  will  be  made  by  the  wind  from  the  opposite 
side. 

And  if  the  wind  is  more  powerful  and  the  bird  moves  its  wings 
backwards  as  oars,  the  bird  will  be  motionless. 

And  if  the  wind  comes  from  above  and  in  front,  and  the  bird  resists 
it  below  and  behind,  then  according  to  the  conditions  of  the  places 
whence  it  may  fall  the  bird  remains  motionless. 

But  when  the  wind  comes  in  front  and  below  it  will  be  more  power- 
ful than  the  weight  of  the  bird;  it  will  then  be  necessary  for  the  wings 


424  FLIGHT 

to  contract  and  occupy  less  of  the  atmosphere,  and  consequently  they 
will  be  smitten  by  a  lesser  quantity  of  wind,  and  for  the  strokes  which 
it  takes  to  have  rather  a  backward  direction,  and  then  the  bird  will 
remain  motionless.  c.a.  71  r.  b 

The  simple  power  of  the  man  will  never  work  the  wing  of  the  crow 
with  such  swiftness  as  the  crow  did  when  it  was  attacked. 

And  the  proof  of  this  will  be  shown  in  the  uproar  they  make,  for 
that  of  the  man  will  never  produce  so  great  a  noise  as  the  wing  of  the 
bird  made  when  it  was  attacked. 


WHY  THE  BIRD  SUSTAINS  ITSELF  UPON  THE  AIR 

The  air  which  is  struck  with  most  swiftness  by  the  movable  thing  is 
compressed  to  the  greatest  degree  in  itself. 

This  is  proved  by  the  fact  that  the  less  thick  flexible  body  will  never 
support  the  thicker  upon  itself,  as  for  example  one  sees  the  anvil  float- 
ing upon  melted  bronze,  and  gold  and  silver  when  liquefied  staying 
beneath  a  fusion  of  lead;  and  for  this  reason,  as  the  atmosphere  is  a 
body  capable  of  being  itself  compressed  when  it  is  struck  by  something 
which  is  moving  at  a  greater  rate  of  speed  than  that  of  its  flight,  it  is 
compressed  into  itself  and  becomes  like  a  cloud  within  the  rest  of  the 
air,  that  is  it  is  of  the  same  density. 

But  when  the  bird  finds  itself  within  the  wind,  it  can  sustain  itself 
above  it  without  beating  its  wings,  because  the  function  which  the  wing 
performs  against  the  air  when  the  air  is  motionless  is  the  same  as  that 
of  the  air  moved  against  the  wings  when  these  are  without  motion. 

c.a.  77  r.  b 

WHY  THE  BIRD  FALLS  IN  A  PARTICULAR  LINE 

On  whatever  side  the  weight  of  the  bird  is  as  it  drops  from  a  position 
of  equality,  on  that  side  its  descent  will  be. 

And  at  whatever  angle  the  bird  sets  itself,  in  the  same  angle  its 
descent  will  be. 

And  if  a  part  is  bent  forward  and  the  wings  spread  out  at  an  equal 
slant,  the  movement  of  the  bird  will  be  in  the  centre  of  the  two  inclined 
parts. 


FLIGHT  425 

And  this  movement  will  slope  more  towards  the  part  which  bends 
more. 
[Drawing] 

That  circle  will  be  of  less  size  in  which  the  bird  sets  itself  on  a  less 
slanting  line. 

The  slant  of  the  wings  always  tends  to  be  equal  to  the  slant  of  the 
body  of  the  bird. 
[  Drawing  a  b\ 

If  the  wings  are  held  slanting  and  the  bust  in  a  position  of  equality, 
without  doubt  the  bird  will  descend  along  the  line  of  the  slant  of  the 
wings;  but  this  slant  will  be  varied  to  the  right  or  left  as  is  in  the 
movement  a  b.  c.a.  77  v.  b 


HOW  MANY  ARE  THE  WAYS  IN  WHICH  A  BIRD  TURNS  ITS 
STRAIGHT   MOVEMENT   INTO   A   CURVING   MOVEMENT? 

The  bird  that  wishes  to  turn  its  straight  course  into  a  curved  one 
without  raising  or  lowering  its  height,  moves  the  wing  on  the  convex 
side  of  its  curving  movement  more  frequently  than  it  does  that  on  the 
concave  side  of  this  movement. 

The  wing  of  the  bird  as  it  beats  its  wings  has  the  shoulder  raised 
more  in  front  than  behind;  and  this  it  does  in  order  to  acquire  move- 
ment, because  if  the  wings  were  to  move  equally  up  and  down  the 
bird  would  not  move  from  its  first  position. 

The  bird  bends  its  straight  course  towards  that  side  on  which  the 
wing  is  most  lowered.  And  it  is  as  though  this  wing  were  more  smit- 
ten by  the  wind  than  the  other. 


OF  THE  BIRD  AS  IT  FLIES  WITH  BOUNDS  (BALZI) 

The  bird  which  flies  with  a  bound  acquires  impetus  in  its  descent, 
because  in  the  course  of  this  by  closing  its  wings  it  acquires  weight, 
and  consequently  velocity;  it  follows  therefore  that  the  reflex  move- 
ment is  more  powerful,  and  adding  to  this  the  fact  of  it  beating  its 
wings,  it  creates  double  the  power  which  is  produced  by  the  simple 
reflex  movement,  and  by  the  fact  of  this  duplication  the  reflex  move- 
ment becomes  longer  than  it  would  have  been  without  the  addition 


426  FLIGHT 

made  by  the  beating  of  its  wings.  And  this  is  the  real  cause  why  the 
reflex  movement  is  equal  to  its  falling  movement  and  why  at  the  end  of 
the  flight  there  is  equality  in  the  extent  of  its  descent  and  of  its  ascent. 

When  the  bird  descends  with  a  great  slant  without  beating  its  wings 
all  the  extremities  of  the  wings  and  tail  bend  upwards,  and  this  move- 
ment is  slow,  for  the  bird  is  not  only  supported  by  the  air  beneath  it 
but  by  the  lateral  air  towards  which  the  convex  surface  of  the  bent 
feathers  spreads  itself  at  equal  angles. 

When  the  bird  rises  from  the  ground  to  a  height  and  leaps  and  closes 
its  open  wings  with  impetus,  and  makes  a  wave  of  the  air  which  is 
compressed  and  strikes  upwards  at  its  breast  from  below,  the  impetus 
of  this  tending  to  continue,  the  movement  drives  the  bird  to  a  height, 
and  it  flaps  its  wings  many  times  quite  regularly  in  the  course  of  this 
movement  until  it  has  risen  up  sufficiently. 

The  bird  which  rises  with  a  circular  movement  stays  in  a  slanting 
position  with  the  breadth  of  its  wings,  and  the  circle  in  which  it 
revolves  will  be  so  much  greater  in  proportion  as  its  position  is  more 
slanting;  and  this  circle  will  be  so  much  smaller  as  its  position  is  less 
slanting. 

The  bird  which  makes  a  greater  movement  with  one  wing  than  the 
other  will  describe  a  circular  movement,  and  the  movement  will  also 
be  circular  when  the  wing  is  beaten  on  one  side  and  held  motionless  on 
the  other;  and  the  circle  will  be  so  much  greater  or  less  according  as 
this  wing  is  moved  more  slowly  or  more  rapidly. 

Movement  of  the  bird  driven  by  the  wind: 

The  bird  which  is  driven  by  the  wind,  when  it  raises  itself  without 
beating  its  wings  lengthens  the  turning  process  more  in  the  falling 
movement  than  in  the  reflex  movement;  but  in  the  reflex  movement  it 
rises  and  in  the  falling  movement  it  lowers  itself. 

The  bird  in  descending  against  the  wind  lowers  its  feet  as  the  wind 
strikes  them,  and  this  it  does  in  order  not  to  disarrange  the  tail  from 
the  direction  of  the  whole  body  when  it  wishes  to  lower  itself. 

c.a.  97  v.  a 

The  bird  which  makes  the  shortest  revolving  movement  prepares  the 
extreme  extension  of  its  wings  with  less  slant,  and  for  this  reason  the 


FLIGHT  427 

circle  of  its  revolving  movement  is  so  much  more  curved  as  the  revolv- 
ing movement  is  shorter. 

The  bird  can  never  move  backward,  because  the  points  of  the  wings 
when  extended  are  never  farther  in  front  than  the  centre  of  gravity 
which  the  length  of  the  bird  has  of  itself,  and  this  must  of  necessity  be 
the  case;  whereas  if  it  should  move  backwards  its  feathers  would  turn 
right  over  in  front  and  restrain  the  movement  with  their  resistance; 
and  this  the  bird  shows  us,  for  when  it  is  resting  it  always  turns  its 
beak  to  the  wind. 

If  the  left  horn  of  the  tail  is  as  far  above  the  centre  line  of  movement, 
and  above  the  centre  line  of  the  weight  which  the  bird  has  in  the  line 
of  its  movement,  as  the  right  horn  of  this  tail  is  below  the  said  centres, 
the  movement  of  the  bird  will  of  necessity  be  straight,  because  the  left 
horn  of  the  tail  is  as  powerful  to  bend  the  straight  movement  of  the 
bird  to  the  right  when  it  is  above  the  bird  as  the  right  horn  of  this  tail 
is  to  bend  the  bird  to  the  left  when  it  is  below  the  bird. 

The  bird  will  always  descend  in  the  direction  in  which  it  weighs 
most. 

The  bird  weighs  most  in  the  direction  in  which  its  breadth  is  least. 
[Diagram]  Therefore  it  will  descend  by  the  line  a  b  and  not  by  the 
line  b  a. 

I  have  seen  the  sparrow  and  the  lark  fly  upward  in  a  straight  line 
when  they  were  in  a  level  position.  And  this  happens  because  the  wing 
raised  with  swift  movement  remains  filled  with  holes,  and  only  rises 
with  the  impetus  it  has  acquired,  and  this  is  renewed  in  the  lowering 
of  the  wings,  for  the  wing  then  reunites  and  presses  one  feather  in 
beneath  another,  as  is  said  in  the  eighth  of  this. 

The  bird  which  descends  with  the  wind  that  strikes  it  below  increases 
this  descent  by  raising  its  tail,  exposing  the  under  part  of  it  to  the 
percussion  of  the  wind. 

The  bird  whenever  it  rests  upon  any  spot  always  takes  up  its  position 
with  its  beak  against  the  approach  of  the  wind. 

It  is  always  the  under  side  of  the  branches  of  any  plant  that  show 
themselves  to  the  wind  which  strikes  it,  and  one  leans  against  another. 

c.a.  160  r.  b 

Unless  the  movement  of  the  wing  which  presses  the  air  is  swifter 


428  FLIGHT 

than  the  flight  of  the  air  when  pressed,  the  air  will  not  become  con- 
densed beneath  the  wing,  and  in  consequence  the  bird  will  not  support 
itself  above  the  air. 

That  part  of  the  air  which  is  nearest  to  the  wing  will  most  resemble 
in  its  movement  the  movement  of  the  wing  which  presses  on  it;  and 
that  part  will  be  more  stable  which  is  farther  removed  from  the  said 
wing. 

That  part  of  the  air  which  is  nearest  to  the  wing  which  presses  on  it, 
will  have  the  greatest  density. 

The  air  has  greater  density  when  it  is  nearer  to  water,  and  [greater 
rarity]  when  it  is  nearer  to  the  cold  region,  and  midway  between  these 
it  is  purer. 

The  air  of  the  cold  region  offers  no  resistance  to  the  movement  of 
the  birds  unless  they  have  already  passed  through  a  considerable  space 
of  the  air  beneath  them. 

The  extremities  of  the  wings  of  birds  are  of  necessity  flexible. 

The  properties  of  the  air  are  such  that  it  may  become  condensed  or 
rarefied.  c.a.  161  r.  a 

No  impetus  created  by  any  movement  whatever  can  be  immediately 
consumed,  but  if  it  finds  an  object  which  has  a  great  resistance  it  con- 
sumes itself  in  a  reflex  movement. 

The  impetus  acquired  by  the  beating  of  the  wings  in  the  slanting 
descent  of  birds  is  the  reason  for  these  birds  descending  for  a  long 
space  without  beating  their  wings  and  for  the  said  slant. 

Define  what  impetus  is  and  what  slanting  movement  consists  in,  and 
which  has  the  greater  or  less  slant,  and  how  the  reflex  movement  of 
birds  becomes  more  or  less  slanting  according  to  the  greater  or  less 
opening  of  the  tail  and  wings. 

The  impetus  acquired  will  be  more  permanent  when  the  movement 
of  the  descent  slants  less. 

Impetus  is  a  power  of  the  mover  applied  in  a  movable  thing  which 
causes  the  movable  thing  to  move  after  it  is  separated  from  its  mover. 

[There  will  never  be  impetus  unless  the  resistance  of  the  movable 
thing  is  completely  subdued  by  its  mover.]  And  especially  when  the 
dense  friction  of  the  bodies  moved  resists  the  movable  thing. 

This  may  be  seen  in  the  case  of  a  beam  drawn  by  oxen  which  only 


FLIGHT  429 

moves  so  long  as  the  oxen  are  in  movement,  and  when  the  cause  has 
ceased  the  effect  tails,  that  is  that  the  movement  of  the  beam  ends 
together  with  the  movement  of  the  oxen. 

When  the  friction  of  the  movable  thing  over  the  place  where  it  is 
moved  is  of  slight  density,  the  power  of  the  mover  will  be  united  for  so 
great  a  space  with  the  movable  thing,  since  this  is  separated  from  the 
mover  in  proportion  as  the  friction  is  of  less  density.  So  one  sees  a  barge 
drawn  through  the  water  for  a  certain  distance  of  its  own  accord  after 
it  has  been  separated  from  the  power  of  its  mover;  and  the  bird,  after 
it  has  beaten  its  wings,  moves  upon  the  compressed  air  without  any 
further  beating  of  its  wings,  carried  for  a  long  distance  by  its  impetus. 

Movable  things  and  movers  are  of  three  kinds,  of  which  one  moves 
through  as  much  space  as  the  movement  made  by  its  mover,  and  this  is 
only  slightly  dominated  by  the  power  of  the  mover;  another  moves 
through  a  much  less  space  than  that  traversed  by  the  mover,  and  this  in 
itself  is  of  greater  resistance  than  the  power  of  its  mover,  not  taking 
into  account  the  space  that  intervenes  between  the  mover  and  the 
movable  thing;  the  third  moves  in  the  same  time  through  a  consider- 
ably greater  space  than  that  over  which  its  mover  is  moved;  and  this 
movable  thing  in  itself  not  taking  into  account  the  intervening  space 
has  much  less  power  of  resistance  than  its  mover. 

There  are  other  powers  of  mover  and  movable  things,  in  which  the 
movable  thing  follows  or  is  followed  by  its  movement  over  such  space 
and  direction  as  has  that  of  its  mover,  and  after  the  mover  remains 
without  movement  the  movable  thing  exerts  the  power  of  the  mover, 
and  by  means  of  this  it  moves  through  a  long  tract  of  space,  as  the 
arrow  does  when  shot  from  the  cord  of  the  bow,  which  moves  for  a 
long  time  by  itself,  after  the  cord  of  the  bow  has  separated  itself  from  it.

The  bird  may  stay  in  the  air  without  change  of  position,  even  if  the 
power  of  the  wind  is  greater  than  the  power  of  the  weight  of  this  bird; 
and  it  does  this  with  a  slight  swift  movement  of  the  wings  using  them 
as  oars  behind  the  flight  of  the  wind  with  greater  speed  than  that  of 
this  wind,  and  so  it  is  in  a  position  of  equilibrium. 

The  bird  may  stay  in  the  air  without  change  of  wings  or  of  position, 
even  if  the  power  of  the  movement  of  the  air  is  more  powerful  than 


430  FLIGHT 

the  weight  of  the  bird.  And  this  contrast  is  due  to  its  slant  and  it  is  in 
a  slanting  line. 

When  there  is  the  same  span  of  wing  the  bird  which  is  in  a  more 
sloping  line  will  be  the  heavier  in  the  air.  c.a.  180  r.  a 

The  bird  which  beats  its  wings  with  equal  movement  without  beat- 
ing its  tail  will  have  a  straight  movement;  but  if  one  of  the  wings  drop 
more  than  the  other  the  straight  movement  will  be  changed  to  a  curve 
and  it  will  circle  downwards  round  a  spot  below  to  which  the  lower 
wing  is  pointing.  c.a.  184  v.  c 

[With  diagrams] 

Sudden  changes  of  the  wings  and  tail  of  birds  make  sudden  changes 
in  the  lines  of  their  movements.  For  suppose  the  bird  is  moving  in  an 
eastward  direction  and  suddenly  turns  towards  the  west;  this  sudden 
turn  is  effected  by  extending  one  of  its  wings  on  the  side  on  which  it 
wishes  to  turn,  and  turning  it  so  that  it  faces  the  percussion  of  the  air 
in  the  line  in  which  it  is  moving,  drawing  the  opposite  wing  to  itself 
and  bending  the  tail  in  such  a  way  that  that  extended  wing,  that  is  as  in 
the  bird  a  d  /,  is  flying  towards  you,  and  as  it  flies  it  immediately  turns 
itself  backward  by  its  right  side  in  /,  and  then  extends  this  wing  d  f 
more  than  usual,  displaying  it  more  in  front  to  the  wind;  and  the  oppo- 
site wing  a  c  will  be  bent  as  in  c  b,  and  the  tail  c  d  will  turn  as  in  e  d; 
then  the  fury  of  the  impetus  is  struck  by  the  air,  and  works  more  in 
that  part  of  the  bird  which  is  more  remote  from  its  centre  of  gravity, 
and  less  in  that  nearer  to  it. 

When  the  bird  rises  in  a  circle  without  beating  its  wings  it  keeps  its 
centre  of  gravity  much  lower  than  the  tips  of  its  wings,  and  receives  the 
wind  underneath  it  from  whatever  side  it  may  come,  after  the  manner 
of  a  wedge,  that  is  either  under  its  tail  or  its  breast  or  each  of  its  wings. 

If  the  water  a  b  strikes  the  tail  of  the  fish  which  is  in  the  axis  above 
the  centre  of  its  accidental  gravity  there  is  no  doubt  that  this  fish  will 
bend  round  this  centre;  but  its  tail  will  bend  more  in  the  current  of  the 
water  than  its  trunk  will,  for  this  being  firmer  offers  more  resistance  in 
its  contrary  movement. 

The  impetus  which  was  circular  in  its  commencement  may  follow 
out  in  itself  the  same  circular  movement  upon  its  axis  as  that  of  the 
millstone  or  the  revolving  wheel,  and  may  follow  it  circular  or  straight. 


FLIGHT  431 

as  the  wheel  of  the  cart  revolving  naturally  outside  of  its  axis  or  as  the 
reflex  movement  made  in  a  slanting  line  by  the  spherical  bodies.  Simi- 
larly the  flight  of  birds,  even  though  the  beginning  of  the  bird's  impulse 
may  be  caused  by  direct  movement,  may  continue  in  circular  move- 
ment for  as  great  a  distance  as  this  impetus  endures. 

The  level  movement  of  birds  when  they  fly  may  swiftly  be  changed 
either  to  a  slanting  or  vertical  movement  towards  the  sky  or  towards 
the  earth.  The  movement  towards  the  sky  occurs  when  the  helms  of 
the  wings  and  also  the  tail  are  turned  towards  the  earth. 

When  a  bird  is  descending  it  keeps  a  straighter  course  and  has  less 
risk  of  being  overturned  if  it  has  its  wings  bent  beneath  it  than  if  it 
keeps  them  straight. 

When  a  bird's  centre  of  gravity  is  below  its  wings  it  has  so  much  the 
less  risk  of  being  turned  upside  down,  as  is  seen  above. 

Make  a  small  one  to  go  over  the  water,  and  try  it  in  the  wind  without 
much  depth  of  water  over  some  part  of  the  Arno,  with  the  wind 
natural,  and  then  as  you  please,  and  turn  the  sail  and  the  helm. 

See  to-morrow  to  all  these  matters  and  the  copies,  and  then  efface  the 
originals  and  leave  them  at  Florence,  so  that  if  you  lose  those  that  you 
take  with  you  the  invention  will  not  be  lost  .  .  . 

There  is  as  much  power  of  movement  in  the  water  or  the  air  against 
an  object  as  there  is  in  this  object  against  the  air  or  the  water. 

The  centre  of  gravity  of  the  fish  lying  level  in  the  water  or  of  the 
bird  lying  level  in  the  air  is  situated  midway  between  the  extremities 
which  offer  equal  resistance. 

Write  of  swimming  under  water  and  you  will  have  the  flight  of  the 
bird  through  the  air.  There  is  a  suitable  place  there  where  the  mills 
discharge  into  the  Arno,  by  the  falls  of  Ponte  Rubaconte. 

There  are  two  different  ways  in  which  a  bird  can  turn  in  any  direc- 
tion while  continually  beating  its  wings.  The  first  of  these  is  when  at 
the  same  time  it  moves  one  wing  more  rapidly  downwards  than  the 
other  with  an  equal  degree  of  force,  the  movement  approximating 
towards  the  tail;  the  second  is  when  in  the  same  space  of  time  the 
movement  of  one  wing  is  longer  than  that  of  the  other.  Also  in  striking 
with  the  wings  downwards  slantwise,  if  they  become  bent  or  moved 
one  lower  down  and  the  other  farther  back,  the  part  which  drives  the 
wing  lower  down  will  be  higher  in  the  first  case,  and  the  opposite  part 


432  FLIGHT 

of  the  wings  which  has  the  longer  movement  backward  will  go  farther 
forward  through  this  first;  consequently  for  this  reason  the  movement 
of  the  bird  will  form  a  curve  round  that  part  of  it  which  is  highest. 

These  then  are  all  the  movements  made  by  the  bird  without  beating 
its  wings,  and  they  are  each  and  all  subject  to  a  single  rule,  for  all 
these  movements  rise  upon  the  wind,  for  they  expose  themselves  to  it 
slantwise  receiving  it  under  their  wings  after  the  manner  of  a  wedge. 

c.a.  214  r.  d 
[Figure] 

The  centre  of  gravity  of  this  bird  forms  the  axis  of  its  equilibrium. 

When  this  bird  raises  itself  in  circles  by  a  single  wind  without  beat- 
ing its  wings  it  keeps  the  impetus  of  the  wind  under  its  wings  so  that 
they  raise  it  as  though  it  was  a  wedge. 

When  the  wind  enters  under  the  left  wing  it  passes  above  the  right 
wing,  and  this  wind  would  throw  the  bird  over,  if  it  were  not  that  the 
tail  is  suddenly  twisted  so  that  the  wind  passes  over  it  and  makes  a 
wedge  opposite  to  it,  and  so  drives  it  in  and  turns  it. 

When  it  has  turned  so  much  that  the  wind  strikes  it  in  the  beak  the 
tail  will  only  work  in  a  straight  line;  but  it  bends  upwards  so  that  the 
wind  strikes  it  above  and  at  the  same  time  the  breast  and  wings  are 
struck  from  below,  but  since  the  force  of  impact  on  the  left  wing  is 
greater  because  it  is  more  bent  the  bird  has  to  wheel  round  and  turn 
its  right  wing  to  face  the  wind. 

When  the  tip  of  the  right  wing  enters  into  the  line  of  the  wind, 
nothing  is  so  useful  in  order  to  make  the  wind  strike  at  more  equal 
angles  as  is  the  bending  of  the  head  and  also  the  neck  against  the 
approach  of  this  wind. 

When  the  tail  enters  into  the  line  of  the  wind  then  this  tail  is  struck 
beneath  by  the  movement  of  the  wind,  and  the  head  is  struck  above, 
and  each  of  the  wings  are  struck  beneath.  But  the  right  wing  in  twist- 
ing is  more  exposed  to  and  afifected  by  the  stroke  of  the  wind  than  is 
the  left,  and  therefore  it  travels  more  with  the  right  than  with  the  left, 
and  therefore  its  movement  becomes  a  curve  and  continually  rises  being 
pushed  up  from  below  by  the  wind. 

The  movement  of  the  wing  against  the  air  is  as  great  as  that  of  the 
air  against  the  wing. 

The  wing  which  is  most  extended  strikes  against  a  greater  quantity 


FLIGHT  433 

of  air,  and  as  a  consequence  descends  less  than  the  wing  which  is  more 
folded  up;  therefore  the  descent  of  this  flying  thing  will  be  made  along 
the  line  of  that  wing  which  is  more  folded  up. 

That  wing  is  more  delayed  which  is  struck  by  the  air  at  more  equal 
angles  or  by  a  greater  quantity  of  air. 

Therefore  when  the  bird  descends  in  a  slanting  direction  and  per- 
ceives itself  to  be  dropping  with  its  left  wing  it  will  extend  this  wing 
more  than  the  other,  that  is  it  will  bend  it  more  in  face  of  the  air 
where  it  strikes.  c.a.  214  v.  a 

[Drawing] 

A  bird  raises  itself  more  swiftly  when  the  circles  in  which  it  rises 
are  smaller. 

What  is  here  set  forth  occurs  because  the  bird  as  it  rises  without  beat- 
ing its  wings  by  the  help  of  the  wind  receives  the  wind  underneath 
it  in  the  manner  of  a  wedge,  and  this  wedge  has  its  greater  angle  upon 
the  side  that  slopes  less,  and  therefore  it  raises  the  object  above  it  more 
and  more. 

The  bird  never  moves  upward  unless  the  wind  enters  underneath  it 
and  forms  itself  into  a  wedge,  driving  it  for  a  certain  distance  along  the 
line  of  its  course. 
[Diagram] 

See  to-morrow  morning  whether  the  bird  as  it  turns  coming  against 
the  wind  n  remains  in  the  line  a  b  keeping  its  head  at  b  or  whether 
it  remains  in  the  line  c  d. 

Here  there  rises  a  doubt,  namely,  whether  the  wedge  does  not  raise 
the  object  which  is  situated  above  itself  in  a  perpendicular  line,  if  this 
object  is  not  supported  in  such  a  way  that  it  has  no  power  to  fly  before 
the  blow  together  with  the  wedge,  as  the  bird  will  be  able  to  rise  above 
the  wind  which  serves  it  as  a  wedge,  so  that  this  wind  will  not  carry  it 
with  it;  it  will  be  so  much  the  more  difficult  therefore  for  this  bird  to 
rise  to  a  height  against  the  wind  if  it  has  not  already  mounted  after  the 
manner  in  which  water  falls  in  an  empty  screw.  c.a.  220  r.  a

HOW  A  BIRD  LOWERS  ITSELF  WITHOUT  THE  USE  OF  THE 
WIND  OR  BEATING  ITS  WINGS 

[Diagram] 

When  the  centre  of  gravity  of  the  bird  is  in  front  of  the  centre  of 
resistance  of  the  wings  the  bird  will  then  descend  by  a  slanting  line 
always  observing  this  slant. 

The  bird's  descent  will  be  found  to  be  of  swifter  movement  when 
the  slant  is  less. 

That  bird  travels  with  the  longer  course  when  its  descent  is  inter- 
rupted by  many  reflex  movements,  that  is  in  waves,  as  is  shown  above; 
let  us  say  that  the  movement  of  the  bird  is  so  arranged  as  to  go  from 
a  to  b,  and  when  it  has  travelled  half  a  mile  it  makes  in  c  d  as  great 
reflex  movement  as  gives  the  nature  of  the  impetus  of  such  descent, 
and  then  brings  back  its  wings  to  their  first  slanting  position  and  de- 
scends afterwards  in  another  movement  of  half  a  mile,  and  then  rises 
up  again  and  reascends  until  it  finishes  its  course  at  the  place  indicated^ 
[Diagram] 

If  the  bird  which  does  not  beat  its  wings  should  not  wish  to  descend 
rapidly  to  a  depth,  then  after  a  certain  amount  of  slanting  descent  it 
will  set  itself  to  rise  by  a  reflex  movement  and  to  revolve  in  a  circle, 
mounting  after  the  manner  of  the  cranes  when  they  break  up  the 
ordinary  lines  of  their  flight  and  come  back  into  a  troop  and  proceed 
to  raise  themselves  by  many  turns  after  the  manner  of  a  screw,  and 
then,  having  gone  back  to  their  first  line  they  follow  their  first  move- 
ment again  which  drops  with  a  gentle  descent,  and  then  return  again 
to  a  troop  and  moving  again  in  a  circle  raise  themselves. 
[Diagram] 

The  bird  which  takes  longer  strokes  with  one  wing  than  with  the 
other  will  progress  with  a  circular  movement.  c.a.  220  v.  c 

With  wings  expanded  the  pelican  measures  five  braccia,  and  it 
weighs  twenty-five  pounds;  its  measurement  thus  expanded  therefore 
is  the  square  root  of  the  measurement  of  the  weight. 

The  man  is  four  hundred  [pounds]  and  the  square  root  of  this  figure 
is  twenty;  twenty  braccia  therefore  is  the  necessary  expanse  of  the  said 
wings. 


FLIGHT  435 

The  width  of  the  wings  of  the  pelican  is  three  quarters  of  a  braccio, 
so  you  will  divide  the  five  braccia  which  it  measures  when  open  into 
quarters,  so  that  there  are  twenty  quarters  in  its  length  and  three 
quarters  in  its  width,  and  you  may  say  that  the  width  is  three  twen- 
tieths of  the  length. 

If  therefore  the  span  of  the  man's  wings  be  twenty  braccia  you  would 
say  that  they  are  also  three  braccia  in  width,  and  three  twentieths  of 
this  length  of  twenty  braccia,  that  is,  where  the  width  is  greatest. 

c.a.  302  r.  b 

The  imperceptible  fluttering  of  the  wings  without  any  actual  strokes 
keeps  the  bird  poised  and  motionless  amid  the  moving  air. 

The  reverse  movement  against  the  direction  of  the  wind  will  always 
be  greater  than  the  advancing  movement;  and  the  reverse  movement 
when  made  with  the  course  of  the  wind  will  be  increased  by  the  wind, 
and  will  become  equal  to  the  advancing  movement. 

The  ways  in  which  birds  rise,  without  beating  their  wings  but  by 
circles,  with  the  help  of  the  wind,  are  of  two  kinds,  simple  and  com- 
plex. The  simple  comprise  those  in  which,  in  their  advancing  move- 
ment, they  travel  above  the  flight  of  the  wind,  and  at  the  end  of  it  turn 
and  face  the  direction  of  the  wind,  receiving  its  buffeting  from  beneath, 
and  so  finish  the  reverse  movement  against  the  wind. 

The  complex  movement  by  which  birds  rise  is  also  circular,  and  con- 
sists of  an  advancing  and  reverse  movement  against  the  direction  of 
the  wind  in  a  course  which  takes  the  form  of  a  half  circle,  and  of  an 
advancing  and  reverse  movement  which  follows  the  course  of  the  wind. 

The  simple  circular  movement  by  which  birds  rise  is  also  circular, 
and  consists  of  an  advancing  and  reverse  movement  against  the  direc- 
tion of  the  wind  in  a  course  which  takes  the  form  of  a  half  circle,  and 
of  an  advancing  and  reverse  movement  which  follows  the  course  of  the 
wind. 

The  simple  circular  movement  of  rising  without  beating  the  wings 
will  always  occur  when  there  is  great  agitation  of  the  winds,  and  this 
being  the  case  it  follows  that  the  bird  in  so  rising  is  also  carried  a  con- 
siderable distance  by  the  force  of  the  wind.  And  the  complex  movement 
will  be  found  to  occur  when  there  are  light  winds,  for  experience  shows 
that  in  these  complex  movements  the  bird  rises  through  the  air  without 


436  FLIGHT 

being  carried  too  far  by  the  wind  in  the  direction  in  which  it  is  travel- 
ling. 

The  down  and  feathers  underneath  the  wings  are  plentiful,  and  at 
the  ends  of  the  wings  and  tail  the  tips  of  the  feathers  are  flexible  or 
capable  of  being  bent,  whilst  those  on  the  front  of  the  wing,  where  it 
strikes  the  air,  are  firm.  c.a.  308  r.  b 

My  opponent  says  that  he  cannot  deny  that  the  bird  cannot  fall 
either  backwards  or  with  head  underneath  in  a  perpendicular  line;  but 
that  it  seems  to  him  that  its  descent  may  be  sheer  if  it  keeps  the  wings 
wide  open  and  has  one  of  the  wings  as  well  as  the  head  below  its  centre 
of  gravity.1  To  this  argument  the  answer  is  the  same  as  to  what  pre- 
ceded it;  that  is,  that  if  this  bird  being  in  such  a  position  without  hav- 
ing other  means  of  aiding  itself  were  to  drop  perpendicularly,  it  would 
be  contrary  to  the  fourth  part  of  the  second  book  of  the  Elements, 
where  it  was  proved  that  every  body  which  falls  freely  through  the 
air  will  fall  in  such  a  way  that  the  heaviest  part  of  it  will  become  the 
guide  of  its  movement;  and  here  the  heaviest  part  is  found  to  be  mid- 
way between  the  extremities  of  the  open  wings,  that  is  midway  between 
the  two  lightest  parts,  and  therefore,  as  has  been  proved,  such  a  descent 
is  impossible. 

We  have  therefore  proved  that  when  a  bird  has  its  wings  spread  out 
and  its  head  somewhat  raised,  it  is  impossible  for  it  ever  to  fall  or 
descend  in  a  perpendicular  line;  on  the  contrary,  it  will  always  descend 
by  a  slanting  line,  and  every  tiny  movement  of  wings  or  tail  changes 
the  direction  and  slanting  descent  of  this  line  to  the  reflex  movement. 

Nature  has  so  provided  that  all  the  large  birds  can  stay  at  so  great  an 
elevation  that  the  wind  which  increases  their  flight  may  be  of  straight 
course  and  powerful.  For  if  their  flight  were  low,  among  mountains 
where  the  wind  goes  wandering  and  is  perpetually  full  of  eddies  and 
whirlwinds,  and  where  they  cannot  find  any  spot  of  shelter  by  reason 
of  the  fury  of  the  icy  blasts  among  the  narrow  defiles  of  the  mountains, 
nor  can  so  guide  themselves  with  their  great  wings  as  to  avoid  being 
dashed  upon  the  cliffs  and  high  rocks  and  trees,  would  not  this  some- 
times prove  to  be  the  cause  of  their  destruction?  Whereas  at  great  alti- 

1  The  MS.  has  here  an  explanation  of  a  diagram:  'that  is,  it  will  drop  in  the  line  a  b, 
the  wings  d  c  being  wide  apart  at  their  natural  extension'. 


FLIGHT  437 

tildes  whenever  through  some  accident  the  course  oi  the  wind  is 
changed  in  any  way  whatsoever  the  bird  has  always  time  to  redirect  its 
course,  and  in  safety  take  a  calm  flight,  which  will  always  be  entirely 
free;  and  it  can  always  pass  above  clouds  and  thereby  avoid  wetting  its 
wings. 

Inasmuch  as  all  beginnings  of  things  are  often  the  cause  of  great 
results,  so  we  may  see  a  small  almost  imperceptible  movement  of  the 
rudder  to  have  power  to  turn  a  ship  of  marvellous  size  and  loaded  with 
a  very  heavy  cargo,  and  that,  too,  amid  such  a  weight  of  water  as 
presses  on  its  every  beam,  and  in  the  teeth  of  the  impetuous  winds 
which  are  enveloping  its  mighty  sails.  Therefore  we  may  be  certain  in 
the  case  of  those  birds  which  can  support  themselves  above  the  course 
of  the  winds  without  beating  their  wings,  that  a  slight  movement  of 
wing  or  tail,  which  will  serve  them  to  enter  either  below  or  above  the 
wind,  will  suffice  to  prevent  the  fall  of  the  said  birds.       c.a.  308  v.  b 

The  thrushes  and  other  small  birds  are  able  to  make  headway  against 
the  course  of  the  wind,  because  they  fly  in  spurts;  that  is  they  take  a 
long  course  below  the  wind,  by  dropping  in  a  slanting  direction 
towards  the  ground,  with  their  wings  half  closed,  and  they  then  open 
the  wings  and  catch  the  wind  in  them  with  their  reverse  movement, 
and  so  rise  to  a  height;  and  then  they  drop  again  in  the  same  way. 

c.a.  313  r.  b 

When  the  slanting  movement  of  the  bird  as  it  drops  against  the 
wind  makes  the  weight  of  the  bird  more  powerful  than  the  wind  that 
strikes  it  in  front,  the  movement  of  this  bird  will  become  swift  against 
this  wind. 

The  bird  which  descends  under  the  straight  approach  of  the  wind 
turns  the  wing  somewhat  over  from  the  shoulder  to  the  tip;  and  it  does 
this  in  order  to  have  as  much  leverage  as  possible  in  the  more  slanting 
movement  against  the  wind.  c.a.  353  r.  c 

The  swallow  has  its  wings  quite  different  from  those  of  the  kite,  for 
it  is  very  narrow  in  the  shoulder  and  long  in  the  span  of  the  wing.  Its 
stroke  when  it  flies  is  made  up  of  two  distinct  actions,  that  is  the  span 
of  the  wing  is  spread  out  like  an  oar  in  the  direction  of  the  tail,  the 
.shoulder  towards  the  earth;  and  in  this  way  while  the  one  movement 


438  FLIGHT 

impels  it  forward  the  other  keeps  it  at  its  height,  and  the  two  combined 
carry  it  a  stage  onward  wherever  it  pleases.  c.a.  369  r.  a 

The  movement  of  the  air  against  a  fixed  thing  is  as  great  as  the  move- 
ment of  the  movable  thing  against  the  air  which  is  immovable. 

And  it  is  the  same  with  water  which  a  similar  circumstance  has 
shown  me  to  act  in  the  same  way  as  does  the  air,  as  with  the  sails  of 
ships  when  accompanied  by  the  lateral  resistance  of  their  helm. 

c.a.  395  r.  b 

[Of  the  flight  of  the  bat  and  of  the  eagle] 

I  say  that  if  the  bat  weighs  two  ounces  and  measures  half  a  braccio 
vvith  wings  expanded  the  eagle  ought  according  to  this  proportion  to 
measure  with  wings  expanded  not  less  than  sixty  braccia,  and  we  see 
by  experience  that  its  breadth  is  not  more  than  three  braccia.  And  it 
would  seem  to  many  who  neither  see  nor  have  seen  similar  creatures 
that  one  of  the  two  would  not  be  able  to  fly,  considering  that  if  there 
exists  the  proper  proportion  between  the  bat's  weight  and  the  breadth 
of  its  wings  then  in  the  case  of  the  eagle  they  are  not  large  enough,  and 
if  the  eagle  is  properly  equipped  the  other  has  them  too  large  and  they 
will  be  inconvenient  and  unsuitable  for  its  use.  We  see  however  both 
the  one  and  the  other  borne  with  the  utmost  dexterity  by  their  wings, 
and  especially  the  bat  which  by  its  swift  turns  and  feints  overcomes  the 
rapid  twists  and  retreats  of  the  flies  and  gnats  and  other  similar 
creatures. 

The  reason  why  the  eagle  supports  itself  with  its  small  wings  as  the 
bat  does  with  its  large  ones  is  contained  in  the  comparison.  .  .  . 

When  a  single  rush  has  the  same  proportion  between  its  size  and  its 
length  as  a  bundle  of  similar  rushes  has,  it  will  in  itself  have  the  same 
strength  and  power  of  resistance  as  the  said  bundle.  Therefore  if  the 
bundle  has  nine  heads  and  supports  nine  ounces  a  single  one  of  these 
similar  rushes  of  which  there  are  nine  heads  will  by  chance  support  one 
ounce. 

Place  on  the  top  of  a  rush  a  danaro1  as  a  weight  and  you  will  see  it 
bend  down  as  far  as  the  ground.  Take  a  thousand  of  these  rushes  and 
tie  them  together  stretched  out,  fix  them  at  the  foot  and  make  the  heads 
level  and  load  them;  you  will  perceive  that  whereas  by  the  first  reason 

1  A  small  coin,  about  20  grains  Troy  in  weight 


FLIGHT  439 

it  ought  to  support  about  three  and  a  half  pounds  it  will  in  fact  support 
more  than  forty. 

So  for  this  reason  it  follows  that  the  expanse  of  air  that  supports  the 
bat  which  weighs  the  two  hundred  and  twentieth  part  of  the  weight  of 
an  eagle,  if  it  had  to  be  trodden  down  and  pressed  by  the  beating  of  the 
wings  of  the  eagle  would  need  to  be  sixty  times  larger.  b  89  v. 

When  a  bird  in  beating  its  wings  raises  them  higher  above  its  centre 
of  gravity  than  it  lowers  them  beneath  it  it  will  have  its  head  higher 
than  its  tail  during  its  movement.  This  is  proved  by  the  fourteenth  of 
this: — the  movable  thing  will  bend  its  straight  movement  more  towards 
the  side  where  its  movement  is  less  impeded  than  to  that  where  it  is 
more  impeded;  and  by  the  eighth  which  says: — it  is  as  much  to  move 
the  air  against  the  immovable  thing  as  to  move  the  thing  against  the 
immovable  air.  Therefore  the  wing  when  it  moves  farther  downward 
than  upward  makes  more  percussion  with  the  air  that  borders  on  it 
below  than  with  that  which  touches  it  above;  and  for  this  reason  its 
straight  movement  will  slant  upwards. 

If  the  bird  while  moving  its  wings  an  equal  distance  below  and 
above  its  centre  of  gravity  moves  them  more  rapidly  downwards  than 
upwards  it  will  curve  its  level  movement  upwards.  This  is  proved  by 
the  ninth  of  the  foregoing  which  said : — Of  the  equal  movements  made 
by  the  wings  of  birds  those  which  are  the  most  rapid  will  have  most 
power  to  compress  the  air  which  borders  on  them  below;  and  by  the 
seventeenth  which  says: — the  percussion  of  a  movable  thing  is  more 
deflected  which  has  struck  against  a  spot  that  offers  more  resistance; 
therefore  it  is  concluded  that  if  the  wing  making  equal  movement 
downward  and  upward  moves  down  more  rapidly  than  up  it  will 
curve  its  level  movement  upwards  rather  than  downwards. 

And  by  the  converse  of  what  has  gone  before  if  the  wings  while 
making  equal  movement  below  and  above  the  bird's  centre  of  gravity 
should  rise  more  swiftly  than  they  fall,  the  bird's  movement  will  slant 
inclining  towards  the  ground.  e  21  v. 

The  inclination  of  the  wings  of  birds  desiring  to  move  with  equi- 
distant movement  to  the  earth  must  necessarily  always  produce  as 
much  more  fatigue  when  moving  downwards  than  upwards,  as  the 
bird  weighs  more  downwards  than  in  the  movement  of  equality.  This 


440  FLIGHT 

is  proved  by  the  thirteenth  of  this  where  it  is  said: — the  weight  of 
every  heavy  thing  is  in  the  line  of  its  movement  and  so  much  more  or 
less  as  this  movement  is  swifter  or  slower. 


Definition  of  impetus 

Impetus  is  a  power  created  by  movement  and  transmitted  from  the 
mover  to  the  movable  thing;  and  this  movable  thing  has  as  much 
movement  as  the  impetus  has  life. 

The  wings  of  birds  feel  as  much  more  effort  downwards  than  up- 
wards when  the  bird  wishes  to  rise  upwards,  in  proportion  as  the  bird 
weighs  more  downwards  than  upwards.  e  22  r. 

A  bird  supporting  itself  upon  the  air  against  the  movement  of  the 
winds  has  a  power  within  itself  that  desires  to  descend,  and  there  is 
another  similar  power  in  the  wind  that  strikes  it  which  desires  to  raise 
it  up. 

And  if  these  powers  are  equal  one  to  the  other  so  that  the  one  can- 
not conquer  the  other,  the  bird  will  not  be  able  either  to  raise  or  lower 
itself,  and  consequently  will  remain  steady  in  its  position  in  the  air. 

This  is  proved  thus : — let  mbea  bird  set  in  the  air  in  the  current  of 
the  wind  a  b  d  c.  As  this  wind  strikes  it  under  the  slant  of  the  wing  n  f 
it  comes  to  make  a  wedge  there  which  would  bear  it  upwards  and 
backwards  by  a  slanting  movement  if  it  were  not  for  the  opposing 
power  of  its  weight,  which  desires  to  drop  down  and  forward,  as  is 
shown  by  its  slant  g  h,  and  since  powers  that  are  equal  to  each  other 
do  not  subdue  but  offer  a  complete  resistance  the  one  to  the  other,  for 
this  reason  the  bird  will  neither  raise  itself  nor  lower  itself;  therefore 
it  will  remain  steady  in  its  position. 
[Figures] 

If  the  bird  shown  above  lowers  its  wings  it  makes  itself  more  stable 
upon  the  air  and  supports  itself  with  less  difficulty,  because  it  oc- 
cupies more  space  by  keeping  its  wings  in  a  position  of  equilibrium 
than  in  either  lowering  or  raising  its  wings.  In  keeping  its  wings  high 
however  it  cannot  bend  them  either  to  the  right  or  the  left  with  the 
same  ease  that  it  would  if  it  kept  them  low.  But  it  is  more  certain 
not  to  be  overturned  in  keeping  its  wings  high  than  in  keeping  them 


FLIGHT  441 

low  and  bending  them  less  to  the  right  or  the  left,  because  as  it  lowers 
itself  on  the  right  side,  through  using  its  tail  as  a  rudder,  there  is  an 
increase  of  resistance,  because  the  wing  embraces  more  air  than  the 
other  wing  on  the  side  on  which  it  descends  abruptly  in  returning  to 
a  position  of  equilibrium.  Consequently  it  is  a  good  expedient  to 
descend  with  a  straight  and  simple  slant,  and  this  it  would  not  be 
able  to  do  if  it  held  its  wings  lower  than  its  body,  for  if  it  were  to  bend 
itself  about  one  of  its  sides  by  using  its  tail  as  a  rudder  it  would  im- 
mediately turn  upside  down,  the  wing  that  is  farther  extended  em- 
bracing more  air  and  offering  more  resistance  to  the  slanting  descent 
than  the  other.  e  22  v. 

The  extremities  of  the  wings  bend  much  more  in  pressing  the  air 
than  when  the  air  is  traversed  without  the  beating  of  the  wings. 

The  simple  part  of  the  wing  is  bent  back  in  the  swift  slanting  descent 
of  the  birds.  This  is  proved  by  the  third  of  this  which  says: — among 
things  which  are  flexible  through  the  percussion  of  the  air,  that  will 
bend  most  which  is  longest  and  least  supported  by  the  opposite  side. 

Therefore  the  longest  feathers  of  the  wings  not  being  covered  by 
the  other  feathers  that  grow  behind  them  and  not  touching  each  other 
from  their  centre  to  their  tip  will  be  flexible,  and  by  the  ninth  of  this 
which  said: — of  things  equally  flexible  that  will  bend  the  most  which 
first  opens  the  air.  And  this  we  shall  prove  by  the  eleventh  which 
says: — of  equal  and  similar  things  bent  by  the  wind  that  will  bend  the 
most  which  is  struck  by  air  of  greater  density. 

The  helms  placed  on  the  shoulders  of  wings  are  extremely  necessary 
for  it  is  these  parts  which  keep  the  bird  poised  and  motionless  in  the 
air  facing  the  course  of  the  winds. 

[  With  drawing  of  wing] 

This  helm  a  is  placed  near  the  spot  where  the  feathers  of  the  wings 
bend,  and  through  being  very  strong  it  bends  but  little  or  not  at  all, 
being  situated  in  a  very  strong  place  and  armed  with  powerful  sinews 
and  being  itself  of  hard  bone  and  covered  with  very  strong  feathers, 
one  of  which  serves  as  a  support  and  protection  of  the  other.

Simple  slant 

If  the  slanting  movement  of  the  bird  be  made  simply  according  to 
the  direction  of  its  length  this  slant  will  be  rectilineal. 

Compound  slant 

But  if  to  the  slant  of  the  length  of  the  bird  there  be  added  the  slant 
of  the  breadth  of  its  open  wings  the  movement  of  this  bird  will  be 
curved,  and  the  curve  will  have  its  concave  side  in  the  direction  of  the 
lower  wing. 

Irregular  movement 

And  if  the  bird  is  struck  by  the  wind  on  the  tip  of  its  lower  wing  its 
compound  movement  with  its  slanting  curve  will  become  broken  and 
will  merely  form  a  straight  slant. 

The  wing  of  the  bird  is  always  concave  in  its  lower  part  as  far  as 
the  part  that  extends  from  the  elbow  to  the  shoulder,  and  in  the  rest 
it  is  convex. 

In  the  concave  part  of  the  wing  the  air  is  whirled  round,  and  in  the 
convex  it  is  pressed  and  condensed.  e  23  v. 


WHY  THE  BIRD  MAKES  A  REVOLVING  MOVEMENT  BY 
BENDING  ITS  TAIL 

All  the  bodies  that  have  length  and  move  through  the  air,  with  their 
lateral  extremities  equidistant  from  the  central  line  of  their  bulk,  will 
make  straight  movements;  the  power  of  the  impetus  which  impels 
these  bodies  varying  neither  in  the  natural  movement  nor  even  in  the 
violent  or  the  semi-natural  movement. 

If  however  the  lateral  extremities  of  the  bodies  that  have  length  are 
at  an  uneven  distance  from  the  central  line  of  their  bulk  the  move- 
ment of  the  body  will  form  a  curve  in  the  air  as  it  moves;  and  such 
curve  will  have  its  concave  part  on  the  side  on  which  the  extremity 
of  the  body  mentioned  is  more  remote  from  the  said  central  line. 


FLIGHT  443 

Concerning  complex  slants  in  birds'  flight 

A  complex  slant  is  said  to  be  that  which  birds  make  when  they  move 
in  the  air  keeping  their  tail  higher  than  their  head  and  one  wing 
lower  than  the  other. 

When  a  bird  flies  in  a  complex  slant  the  movement  in  the  one  slant 
will  be  so  much  swifter  than  in  the  other  as  the  one  is  less  oblique 
than  the  other. 

The  movement  made  by  birds  that  fly  with  a  complex  slant  is  curved. 

The  curve  created  by  the  complex  movement  made  by  birds  as  they 
fly  will  be  greater  or  less  as  the  lateral  slant  is  less  or  greater,  e  35  v. 

The  flight  of  birds  has  but  little  force  unless  the  tips  of  the  wings 
are  flexible.  This  is  proved  by  the  fifth  of  the  Elements  which  says: — 
lateral  power  checks  the  descent  of  heavy  things;  as  may  be  seen  in 
the  case  of  a  man  pressing  with  his  feet  and  back  against  two  sides 
of  a  wall  as  one  sees  chimney  sweepers  do.  Even  so  in  great  measure 
the  bird  does  by  the  lateral  twistings  of  the  tips  of  its  wings  against  the 
air  where  they  find  support,  and  bend. 

When  the  bird  in  its  direct  descent  is  struck  by  the  wind  under  its 
wings  this  descent  will  become  so  much  more  slanting  as  the  wind  is  of 
greater  power.  Proved  by  the  ninth  of  this  which  says: — of  direct 
descents  which  similar  and  equal  heavy  bodies  make  in  the  air  that 
will  slant  most  which  is  struck  by  the  wind  with  most  impetus. 

If  a  bird  fly  with  its  wings  at  equal  height  and  lower  one  of  the  sides 
of  its  tail  its  direct  flight  will  become  curved,  and  this  curve  will  have 
its  concave  side  towards  the  lowered  side  of  the  tail,  and  the  wing  on 
this  side  will  be  as  much  slower  than  the  opposite  wing  as  the  move- 
ment of  the  bird  is  more  curved. 

This  is  proved  by  the  seventh  of  this  which  says: — that  part  of  a 
wheel  as  it  revolves  will  have  least  movement  which  is  nearest  to  the 
centre  of  this  revolution.  As  therefore  the  tip  of  the  wing  a  touches  a, 
the  centre  round  which  it  revolves,  it  will  have  less  movement,  and  the 
opposite  wing  will  have  its  extremity  d  with  the  movement  g  b. 

e  36  r. 

The  descent  of  birds  is  of  two  kinds,  of  which  one  is  with  certainty 
upon  a  fixed  position,  the  other  is  uncertain  upon  two  positions  or 


444  FLIGHT 

more.  In  the  first  its  wings  are  open  and  the  points  are  raised  above 
the  back,  and  with  these  at  equal  height  it  drops  with  straight  simple 
slant  to  its  appointed  place.  The  second  bird  as  it  descends  has  the 
points  of  its  wings  held  lower  than  the  breast  and  bends  its  tail  now 
to  the  right  now  to  the  left,  with  slant  now  simple  now  complex  and 
sometimes  irregular. 
[Figure] 

The  bird  that  is  struck  on  its  side  by  the  wind  moves  the  wing  that 
is  towards  the  wind  with  greater  swifter  motion  than  it  does  the  other 
as  the  wind  is  more  impetuous  in  its  movement.  This  may  be  proved : — 
let  a  b  c  be  the  bird  that  moves  along  the  line  a  f  and  to  the  wind  d, 
which  strikes  it  at  the  side  on  the  wing  a  b,  and  would  carry  it  along 
the  line  of  its  course  if  the  wing  a  b  was  not  swifter  in  its  movement 
than  the  wind.  And  this  is  why  when  the  wind  has  struck  the  side  of 
the  bird  and  by  some  eddying  recoil  has  folded  itself  up  against  the 
wing  which  has  closed  itself  by  flapping,  this  wing  has  thus  had  a 
second  support  against  the  said  bending  of  the  straight  movement  of 
the  bird.  It  must  therefore  be  concluded  that  the  wide  swift  move- 
ment, which  the  wing  that  is  struck  by  the  wind  makes  in  excess  of 
that  made  by  the  opposite  wing,  at  the  same  time  as  the  wind  which 
has  struck  the  bird  and  been  bent  back  against  the  said  wing,  is  that 
which  prevents  the  straight  course  of  birds  from  being  deflected  by 
the  wind.  And  moreover  unless  the  opposite  wing  was  slow  and  of 
little  movement  it  would  strike  into  the  course  of  the  wind  and  the 
wind  [would  strike]  against  it;  and  thus  the  wind  would  be  most 
powerful  to  accompany  this  bird  in  its  course.  e  36  v. 


WHY  THE  FLIGHT  OF  BIRDS  WHEN  THEY  MIGRATE  IS  MADE 
AGAINST  THE  APPROACH  OF  THE  WIND 

The  flight  of  birds  when  they  migrate  is  made  against  the  move- 
ment of  the  wind  not  indeed  in  order  that  their  movement  may  be 
made  more  swiftly  but  because  it  is  more  lasting  and  less  fatiguing. 
And  this  comes  about  because  with  a  slight  beating  of  their  wings 
they  enter  the  wind  with  a  slanting  movement,  this  movement  being 
below  the  wind.  After  this  impetuous  movement  they  place  themselves 
slantwise  upon  the  course  of  the  wind. 


FLIGHT  445 

This  wind  alter  entering  under  the  slant  of  the  bird  alter  the  manner 
of  a  wedge  raises  it  up  during  such  time  as  the  acquired  impetus  takes 
to  consume  itself,  after  which  it  descends  afresh  under  the  wind  and 
again  acquires  speed;  then  repeating  the  above-mentioned  reflex  move- 
ment upon  the  wind  until  it  has  regained  the  elevation  that  it  lost,  and 
so  continuing  in  succession. 

WHY  BIRDS  SELDOM  FLY  IN  THE  DIRECTION  OF  THE 
CURRENT  OF  THE  WIND 

It  very  seldom  happens  that  the  flight  of  birds  is  made  in  the  direc- 
tion of  the  current  of  the  wind,  and  this  is  due  to  the  fact  that  this 
current  envelops  them  and  separates  the  feathers  from  the  back  and  in 
addition  to  this  chills  the  bared  flesh.  But  the  greatest  loss  is  that  after 
the  descent  slantwise  its  movement  cannot  enter  upon  the  wind  and  by 
the  help  of  it  be  thrown  back  to  the  elevation  it  has  left  unless  it  has 
already  turned  backwards,  which  would  not  help  it  to  make  progress 
in  its  journey. 

The  bird  spreads  out  the  feathers  of  its  wings  more  and  more  as  its 
flight  becomes  slower;  and  this  is  according  to  the  seventh  of  the 
Elements  which  says: — that  body  will  become  lighter  which  acquires 
greater  breadth.  e  37  r. 

A  bird  descending  makes  itself  so  much  swifter  as  it  contracts  its 
wings  and  tail.  This  is  proved  by  the  fourth  of  Gravity,  which  says : — 
that  heavy  body  makes  a  more  swift  descent  which  occupies  a  less 
quantity  of  air. 

That  bird  is  more  rapid  in  its  descent  which  descends  by  a  less  slant- 
ing line.  This  is  proved  by  the  second  of  Gravity,  which  says: — that 
heavy  body  is  swiftest  which  descends  by  the  shortest  way. 

A  bird  in  descending  lessens  its  speed  more  and  more  as  it  is  more 
extended.  This  is  proved  by  the  fifth  of  Weight,  which  says: — that 
heavy  body  is  most  checked  in  its  descent  which  is  most  extended. 

A  bird  in  making  a  reflex  movement  rises  in  proportion  as  it  acquires 
greater  breadth.  This  is  proved  by  the  fourteenth  of  Local  Movement, 
which  says : — the  heavy  body  that  occupies  a  less  space  of  air  in  the  line 
of  its  movement  penetrates  it  more  rapidly.  Therefore  the  widest  expan-

sion  of  the  wings  produces  the  greatest  diminution  in  the  bulk  of  the 
whole  bird,  and  in  consequence  the  impetus  of  its  reflex  movement  is 
less  impeded;  and  therefore  it  rises  farther  at  the  end  of  this  reflex 
movement. 

When  the  bird  descends  upon  the  spot  where  it  wishes  to  settle,  it 
raises  its  wings  and  spreads  out  the  half  of  its  length  and  so  descends 
slowly  upon  the  aforesaid  low  place.  e  37  v. 

There  is  as  much  to  move  the  air  against  the  immovable  thing  as  to 
move  the  thing  against  the  immovable  air. 

When  the  bird  moves  with  slow  descent  on  a  long  course  without 
beating  its  wings  and  the  incline  leads  it  more  quickly  to  the  ground 
than  its  intention  is,  it  then  lowers  its  wings  and  moves  them  against 
the  immovable  air,  and  this  movement  raises  the  bird  up  just  as  though 
a  wave  of  wind  struck  it  below:  and  this  is  proved  by  the  last  but  one. 

OF  TWO  CONTRARY  SLANTS  OF  WHICH  ONE  IS  DESCEND- 
ING AND  THE  OTHER  IS  A  REFLEX  MOVEMENT 

The  movement  of  the  bird  that  descends  by  two  contrary  slants  will 
be  longer  in  proportion  as  the  slant  on  which  it  rises  more  resembles 
the  slant  by  which  it  descends. 

This  may  be  proved : — suppose  that  of  itself  the  slant  with  which  the 
bird  descends  makes  a  hundred  miles  an  hour  in  order  to  descend  to 
earth  with  a  descent  of  a  hundred  braccia,  and  that  the  opposite  slant 
along  which  it  makes  its  reflex  action  at  this  time  spares  it  the  half  of 
this  descent,  I  affirm  that  the  movement  which  was  a  hundred  miles  an 
hour  will  become  fifty,  as  is  proved  in  its  place.  e  38  r. 

Birds  always  fly  more  slowly  when  they  raise  their  wings  than  when 
they  lower  them.  This  is  caused  by  the  necessary  period  of  rest  that  is 
required  after  the  adjacent  fatigue  of  the  tired  limbs,  and  moreover 
speed  is  not  necessary  in  raising  these  limbs  as  it  is  in  lowering  them, 
seeing  that  the  impetus  that  carries  the  bird  is  generated  through  a 
long  space  of  movement  in  this  bird.  It  is  sufficient  merely  for  it  to 
have  raised  its  wings  from  where  they  first  descended  when  the  said 
impetus  commences  to  decline,  which  reveals  itself  through  the  falling 
of  the  bird.  But  when  the  bird  wishes  to  acquire  speed  it  resumes  the 


FLIGHT  447 

impetus  nearer  to  its  inception  and  beats  its  wings  more  frequently 
and  with  the  longest  and  most  rapid  movement  possible. 


OF  THE  CIRCLING  MOVEMENT  MADE  BY  THE  KITE 
IN  RISING 

The  circling  movement  made  by  birds  as  they  rise  above  the  wind 
is  produced  by  the  bird  entering  upon  the  wind  with  one  of  its  wings, 
and  balancing  itself  with  the  other  in  the  direct  line  of  the  wind. 

In  addition  to  this  it  lowers  one  of  the  corners  of  its  tail  towards  the 
centre  of  its  circular  movement,  and  because  of  this  the  wind  that 
strikes  it  on  the  inside  checks  the  movement  of  the  side  that  is  lower 
and  nearer  to  the  centre  of  this  circle.  And  this  is  the  cause  of  the 
circling  movement,  and  the  wing  held  above  the  wind  causes  the  bird 
to  rise  to  the  maximum  height  of  the  wind.  e  38  v. 

The  simple  movement  which  the  wings  of  birds  make  is  more  easy 
when  they  rise  than  when  they  are  lowered.  And  this  ease  of  move- 
ment springs  from  two  reasons  of  which  the  first  is  that  the  weight  in 
falling  somewhat  raises  the  wings  up  of  themselves,  the  second  is  due 
to  the  fact  that  owing  to  the  wing  being  convex  above  and  concave 
below  the  air  flows  away  more  easily  from  the  percussion  of  the  wings 
as  they  rise  than  when  they  are  lowered,  for  then  the  air  being  pent 
up  within  the  concavity  of  the  wing  becomes  compressed  more  easily 
than  it  escapes. 


OF  THE  EXPANSION  OF  THE  TAIL  IN  THE  REFLEX 
MOVEMENT  OF  BIRDS 

Birds  spread  out  their  tails  in  their  reflex  movement  because  the  air 
is  compressed  beneath  them  and  resists  the  penetration  of  the  bird  in 
its  maximum  breadth,  so  that  the  impetus  is  consumed  with  just  the 
edge  or  front  of  the  wing.  If  this  were  not  so  the  impetus  acquired  in 
the  falling  movement  would  consume  itself  partly  in  the  direction  of 
the  earth  and  partly  in  the  reflex  movement;  and  then  this  reflex  move- 
ment would  be  as  lacking  in  height  as  that  which  drops  down  by  keep- 
ing the  tail  straight. 


448  FLIGHT 

The  bird  acquires  more  lightness  the  more  it  spreads  itself  out  and 
expands  its  wings  and  tail. 

That  heavy  body  shows  itself  lightest  which  extends  in  greatest 
breadth. 

From  this  conclusion  one  infers  that  by  means  of  a  wide  expanse  of 
wings  a  man's  weight  can  support  itself  in  the  air. 

That  body  shows  itself  less  heavy  which  extends  in  greater  breadth. 

E  39  r. 

OF  THE  CAUSE  OF  THE  CIRCULAR  MOVEMENT  OF  BIRDS 

The  circular  movement  of  birds  is  produced  by  the  unequal  move- 
ment of  their  wings,  and  this  is  caused  by  the  percussion  created  in  the 
air  by  one  of  the  corners  of  the  tail  that  projects  above  or  below  the 
route  made  by  the  bird  in  the  air  traversed  by  it. 

Of  the  things  that  are  moved  by  others  with  simple  movement  the 
thing  moved  is  as  swift  as  the  swiftness  of  its  mover:  therefore  the  bird 
carried  by  the  wind  in  the  same  direction  as  this  wind  will  have  a  speed 
equal  to  it. 

But  if  the  objects  carried  by  the  wind  slant  more  towards  the  ground 
than  the  direction  of  the  course  of  this  wind  the  thing  moved  will  be 
swifter  than  its  mover.  And  if  the  slant  of  the  objects  carried  by  the 
wind  turns  towards  the  sky  this  is  a  clear  sign  that  the  movement  of 
the  thing  moved  is  slower  than  that  of  the  wind.  The  reason  is  that 
when  the  slant  is  turned  towards  the  ground  it  produces  this  move- 
ment by  reason  of  its  gravity  and  not  by  the  help  of  the  wind.  But 
when  the  slant  of  the  movement  made  by  the  thing  moved  is  towards 
the  sky,  this  slant  is  caused  merely  by  the  shape  of  the  thing  moved, 
for  it  bears  itself  like  a  leaf  which  caught  by  the  wind  in  its  breadth 
raises  itself  up  merely  by  the  help  of  the  wind,  and  moves  as  much  as 
its  mover,  as  has  been  shown  in  its  place.  e  39  v. 

When  the  bird  is  driven  by  the  wind  and  has  a  more  slanting  course 
than  the  course  of  the  wind  it  is  so  much  swifter  than  the  said  wind. 

When  the  bird  driven  by  the  wind  has  its  movement  parallel  to  that 
of  the  wind  it  also  has  a  speed  equal  to  that  of  the  wind. 

When  birds  are  driven  by  the  wind  without  beating  their  wings  the 


FLIGHT  449 

bird  is  swifter  than  the  wind  in  proportion  as  its  course  is  more  slanting 
than  that  of  the  wind.  This  is  proved  as  follows:  suppose  the  wind  in 
a  position  ot"  equality  to  move  one  degree  of  space  in  one  degree  of  time 
and  the  bird  driven  by  the  same  wind  to  move  the  same  degree  in  the 
same  time,  these  movements  up  to  this  point  will  be  equal.  But  on  ac- 
count of  the  slant  in  the  bird's  movement  let  us  assume  it  to  acquire 
a  second  degree  of  movement  in  the  same  time  that  the  wind  is  ac- 
quiring its  first  degree;  it  follows  therefore  that  the  bird  in  the  same 
time  can  be  twice  as  fast  as  the  wind  that  drives  it. 

But  this  same  slanting  movement  does  not  acquire  its  distance  within 
a  position  of  equilibrium,  but  between  this  position  of  equilibrium  and 
the  centre  of  the  earth,  as  if  the  position  of  equilibrium  was  the  line 
a  c  along  which  the  wind  moves  from  a  to  c,  and  the  bird  moves  by 
the  help  of  the  wind  and  by  help  of  its  gravity  from  a  to  d.  I  say  that  in 
the  same  time  in  which  the  bird  shall  be  moved  (without  the  help  of 
its  gravity)  from  a  to  b,  it  will  be  moved  by  the  help  of  the  wind  and 
of  its  gravity  from  a  to  d,  the  one  movement  being  in  the  proportion 
of  one  and  a  half  as  compared  with  the  other,  from  a  to  d  upon  the 
movement  a  b.  But  as  regards  the  distance  of  the  aspects,  a  d  is  the 
same  as  a  b,  as  is  shown  us  by  the  perpendicular  b  d.  e  40  r. 

OF  BIRDS  WHICH  FLY  IN  COMPANIES 

When  the  birds  which  fly  in  companies  come  to  make  long  journeys, 
and  the  wind  chances  to  strike  them  on  one  side,  they  are  greatly 
helped  in  their  flight  because  the  flight  is  made  in  loops  without  work- 
ing their  wings;  because  the  falling  movement  is  made  beneath  the 
wind,  with  the  wings  somewhat  close  together,  and  in  the  direction  in 
which  they  are  travelling.  But  the  reflex  movement  is  made  above  the 
wind;  and  with  the  wings  held  open  it  rises  up  as  the  wind  meets  it, 
and  consequently,  the  wind  entering  beneath  the  bird  lifts  it  up  towards 
the  sky,  after  the  manner  of  a  wedge,  when  it  penetrates  beneath  a 
heavy  body  which  is  set  above  it.  By  this  means,  after  the  birds  have 
been  lifted  up  to  their  proper  height,  which  is  the  equivalent  of  that  at 
the  beginning  of  the  falling  movement,   they   return  to   their  first 


450  FLIGHT 

course,  recommencing  always  in  this  course  their  falling  movements; 
and  their  reflex  movements  are  always  made  against  the  wind. 

e  40  v. 

OF  FLYING  THINGS 

Before  birds  start  on  long  journeys  they  wait  for  the  winds  favour- 
able to  their  movements,  and  these  favourable  winds  are  of  a  different 
kind  with  different  sorts  of  birds,  because  those  which  fly  in  jerks  or 
bounds  are  obliged  to  fly  against  the  wind,  others  receive  the  wind 
on  one  of  their  sides  at  different  angles  and  others  receive  it  on  both 
sides.  But  the  birds  that  fly  by  jerks  such  as  fieldfares  and  other  birds 
like  these  which  fly  in  companies,  have  the  feathers  of  their  wings 
weak  and  poorly  protected  by  the  lesser  feathers  which  form  a  covering 
for  the  larger  ones.  And  this  is  why  it  is  necessary  that  their  flight 
should  be  against  the  course  of  the  wind,  for  the  wind  closes  up  and 
presses  one  feather  upon  another  and  so  renders  their  surface  smooth 
and  slippery  when  the  air  tries  to  penetrate  it.  It  would  be  the  contrary 
if  the  wind  were  to  strike  these  birds  towards  the  tail,  because  then  it 
would  penetrate  under  each  feather  and  turn  them  over  towards  the 
head,  and  thus  their  flight  would  have  a  confused  movement,  like  that 
of  a  leaf  blown  about  in  the  course  of  the  winds  which  goes  perpet- 
ually whirling  through  the  air  continually  revolving,  and  in  addition 
to  this  their  flesh  would  be  without  protection  against  the  buffeting 
of  the  cold  winds.  And  in  order  to  avoid  such  accidents  they  fly  against 
the  course  of  the  wind  with  a  curving  movement,  and  their  bounds  ac- 
quire great  impetus  in  their  descent,  which  is  made  with  wings  closed 
under  the  wind.  And  the  reflex  movement  proceeds  with  wings  open 
above  the  wind,  which  brings  the  bird  back  to  the  same  height  in  the 
air  as  that  from  which  it  first  descended,  and  so  it  continues  time  after 
time  until  it  arrives  at  the  desired  spot. 

The  reflex  movement  and  the  falling  movement  vary  in  birds  in  two 
ways,  of  which  one  is  when  the  reflex  movement  is  in  the  same  direc- 
tion as  the  falling  movement,  the  second  is  when  the  reflex  movement 
is  in  one  direction  and  the  falling  movement  is  in  another. 

The  bird  in  the  falling  movement  closes  its  wings  and  in  the  reflex 
movement  it  opens  them :  it  does  this  because  a  bird  becomes  heavier  in 


FLIGHT  451 

proportion  as   ii   tokls   its  wings  and  so  much  Lighter  as  it  opens  its 
wings  more. 

The  reflex  movement  is  always  made  against  the  wind  and  the  fall- 
ing movement  is  made  in  the  direction  in  which  the  wind  is  moving. 

e  41  r. 

If  the  flight  of  the  bird  turns  to  the  south  without  beating  its  wings 
when  the  wind  is  in  the  east,  it  will  make  the  falling  movement  recti- 
linear with  its  wings  somewhat  contracted  and  underneath  the  wind. 
But  the  reflex  movement  which  succeeds  this  falling  movement  will 
be  with  the  wings  and  tail  open  and  it  will  have  been  directed  towards 
the  east. 

At  the  end  of  this  movement  it  will  turn  its  front  back  again  to  the 
south  and  with  its  wings  folded  it  will  create  again  the  succeeding 
falling  movement  which  will  be  of  the  same  nature  at  the  first,  desiring 
to  make  a  long  course  with  the  help  of  this  wind;  and  the  junction  of 
the  falling  movement  with  the  reflex  movement  will  always  be  of  the 
nature  of  a  rectangle,  and  so  will  be  that  of  the  reflex  movement  with 
the  falling  movement. 

There  are  two  ways  in  which  the  wind  causes  birds  to  become  sta- 
tionary in  the  air  without  beating  their  wings. 

The  first  is  when  the  wind  strikes  against  the  sides  of  steep  moun- 
tains or  other  rocks  by  the  sea,  as  the  bird  then  sets  itself  at  such  an 
angle  that  it  carries  in  front  as  much  of  its  weight  against  the  reflex 
wind  as  this  wind  in  front  has  power  in  its  resistance.  And  since  equal 
powers  cannot  prevail  over  each  other  it  follows  that  in  such  a  position 
a  bird  through  its  imperceptible  vibration  remains  motionless.  The 
second  way  is  when  the  bird  sets  itself  at  such  a  slant  above  the  course 
of  the  wind  that  it  has  as  much  power  to  descend  as  the  wind  has  to 
resist  its  descent. 

When  by  the  help  of  the  wind  the  bird  rises  without  beating  its 
wings  and  makes  a  circular  movement,  and  when  it  spreads  its  tail  at 
the  uprising  of  the  wind,  it  is  being  driven  by  two  powers,  one  of 
which  is  that  of  the  wind  which  strikes  the  wings  in  the  hollow  be- 
neath them  and  the  other  is  the  weight  of  the  bird  which  is  descend- 
ing by  a  complex  slant.  And  from  the  fact  of  its  acquiring  such  velocity 
it  comes  to  pass  that  as  it  turns  its  breast  to  meet  the  onset  of  the  wind 


452  FLIGHT 

this  wind  acts  under  the  bird  after  the  manner  of  a  wedge  which  lifts 
up  a  weight;  thus  the  bird  makes  its  reflex  movement  much  higher 
than  the  commencement  of  its  falling  movement;  and  this  is  the  true 
cause  why  birds  rise  some  distance  without  beating  their  wings. 

e  41  v. 

DEFINITION  OF  THE  MOVEMENTS 

Straight  movement  is  that  which  extends  from  one  point  to  another 
by  the  shortest  line. 

Curved  movement  is  that  in  which  there  is  found  some  part  of 
straight  movement. 

Spiral  movement  is  formed  out  of  slanting  and  curved  lines  in  which 
the  lines  drawn  from  the  centre  to  the  circumference  are  all  found  to 
be  of  varying  length,  and  it  is  of  four  kinds,  namely  convex  spiral, 
level  spiral  and  concave  spiral  and  the  fourth  is  a  spiral  in  cylindrical 
form.  There  is  also  the  circular  movement  always  made  round  about  a 
point  at  equal  distance,  which  is  said  to  be  revolving,  since  there  are 
there  irregular  movements  which  although  they  are  infinite  are  made 
up  of  a  blend  of  each  of  the  aforesaid  movements. 

The  commencement  of  the  simple  falling  movement  is  always  higher 
than  the  termination  of  its  simple  reflex  movement,  the  mobile  genera- 
tor of  these  movements  being  immobile  in  the  air. 

But  the  complex  falling  movement  in  conjunction  with  the  complex 
reflex  movement  will  have  the  contrary  result  to  the  simple,  provided 
that  the  falling  movement  is  lower  than  the  reflex  movement,  and  this 
arises  out  of  the  fact  that  the  bird  which  below  the  wind  creates  this 
falling  movement  presses  down  and  lowers  the  course  of  this  move- 
ment; but  the  reflex  which  is  produced  above  the  wind  with  wings  open 
raises  it  considerably  higher  than  the  commencement  of  this  falling 
movement.  e  42  r. 


DEFINITION  OF  THE  WAVES  AND  IMPETUS  OF  THE  WIND 
AGAINST  FLYING  THINGS 

The  bird  maintains  itself  in  the  air  by  imperceptible  balancing  when 
near  to  the  mountains  or  lofty  ocean  crags;  it  does  this  by  means  of  the 
curves  of  the  winds  which  as  they  strike  against  these  projections, 


FLIGHT  453 

being  forced  to  preserve  their  fust  impetus  bend  their  straight  course 
towards  the  sky  with  divers  revolutions,  at  the  beginning  of  which  the 
birds  come  to  a  stop  with  their  wings  open,  receiving  underneath  them- 
selves the  continual  bufferings  of  the  reflex  courses  of  the  winds,  and 
by  the  angle  of  their  bodies  acquiring  as  much  weight  against  the  wind 
as  the  wind  makes  force  against  this  weight.  And  so  by  such  a  condi- 
tion of  equilibrium  the  bird  proceeds  to  employ  the  smallest  beginnings 
of  every  variety  of  power  that  can  be  produced. 

Of  the  movement  and  the  eddies  made  by  the  current  of  the  air 
striking  upon  various  projections  of  the  mountains,  and  how  the  birds 
steer  themselves  in  the  various  tempests  of  the  winds  by  the  impercep- 
tible balancing  of  their  wings  and  tail: 

The  falling  movement  is  always  united  with  the  reflex  movement 
and  the  beginning  of  the  reflex  movement  is  united  with  the  end  of 
the  falling  movement;  and  if  such  movements  form  a  continuous  suc- 
cession always  following  each  other,  one  will  be  the  cause  of  the  other, 
and  the  death  of  one  will  immediately  produce  the  other,  so  that  they 
will  never  both  exist  at  the  same  time;  and  the  falling  movement  has 
a  weak  beginning  and  is  continually  increasing  and  the  reflex  move- 
ment is  the  opposite. 


HOW  THE  TAIL  OF  THE  BIRD  IS  USED  AS  A  RUDDER 

When  the  bird  lowers  its  tail  equally  it  descends  by  a  straight  slant- 
ing movement.  But  if  it  is  more  lowered  on  the  right  side  then  the 
straight  line  of  the  descent  will  become  curved  and  will  bend  towards 
the  right  side  with  a  greater  or  less  curve  of  movement  in  proportion 
as  the  right  point  of  the  tail  is  higher  or  lower,  and  if  the  left  point  of 
the  tail  is  lowered  it  will  do  the  same  on  the  left  side. 

But  if  the  tail  is  raised  equally  a  little  above  the  level  of  the  back  of 
the  bird  it  will  move  along  a  straight  line  slanting  upwards;  but  if  it 
raises  the  right  point  of  the  tail  more  than  the  left  this  movement  will 
be  curved  towards  the  right  side,  and  if  it  raises  the  left  point  of  the  tail 
this  straight  movement  will  curve  on  the  left  side.  e  42  v. 

When  two  movements  of  impetus  meet,  the  percussion  is  more 
powerful  than  if  they  were  without  encounter.  As  therefore  the  im- 


454  FLIGHT 

petus  of  the  bird  encounters  the  impetus  of  the  wind  its  simple  impetus 
increases  and  the  reflex  movement  is  greater  and  higher. 

The  bird  moves  against  the  wind  without  beating  its  wings  and  this 
is  done  beneath  the  wind  as  it  descends,  and  then  it  makes  a  reflex 
action  above  this  wind  until  it  has  consumed  the  impetus  already  ac- 
quired, and  here  it  is  necessary  that  the  descent  should  be  so  much 
swifter  than  the  wind  that  the  death  of  the  acquired  impetus  at  the  end 
of  the  reflex  movement  may  be  equal  to  the  speed  of  the  wind  that 
strikes  it  below. 


WHY  SMALL  BIRDS  DO  NOT  FLY  AT  A  GREAT  HEIGHT 
AND  LARGE  ONES  DO  NOT  LIKE  TO  FLY  LOW 

This  arises  from  the  fact  that  the  small  birds  being  without  feathers 
cannot  endure  the  intense  cold  of  the  great  height  of  the  air  at  which 
fly  eagles  and  other  large  birds  which  have  more  power  of  movement 
and  are  covered  with  many  rows  of  feathers.  Also  the  small  birds  hav- 
ing feeble  and  simple  wings  support  themselves  in  the  lower  air  which 
is  thick  and  would  not  support  themselves  in  the  rarefied  air  which 
offers  less  resistance. 

The  end  of  the  reflex  movement  is  much  higher  (for  the  birds  which 
fly  against  the  wind)  than  the  beginning  of  their  falling  movement; 
and  by  this  Nature  does  not  break  her  own  laws,  and  this  is  shown  by 
what  has  gone  before.  e  43  r. 

HOW  THE  BIRD  RISES  BY  MEANS  OF  THE  WIND  WITHOUT 
BEATING   ITS  WINGS 

The  bird  rises  to  a  great  height  without  beating  its  wings  by  means 
of  the  wind,  which  strikes  it  in  a  great  mass  underneath  its  wings  and 
tail  placed  slantwise  and  above  its  back  placed  at  an  opposite  slant. 

This  may  be  proved: — suppose  the  wind  compressed  beneath  the 
bird  to  have  the  same  effect  beneath  it  that  one  sees  happening  when  a 
wedge  is  driven  beneath  a  weight,  for  the  wedge  at  each  degree  of  its 
movement  causes  the  weight  to  acquire  a  degree  of  height.  But  since 
the  opposite  slant  of  the  body  which  the  bird  has  is  disposed  to  descend 
against  the  approach  of  the  wind  with  the  same,  power  as  that  with 


FLIGHT  455 

which  the  wind  raises  it  up,  through  the  slant  of  the  body  being  con- 
trary to  that  of  the  wings,  it  is  covered  as  much. 
[A  il raiting  of  a  sector] 

Here  it  is  necessary  to  calculate  the  degrees  of  the  slant,  for  in  no 
degree  of  slant  either  of  an  object  upon  the  water  or  a  bird  in  the  air 
do  they  stop,  but  their  speed  will  be  greater  or  less  as  their  position 
slants  less  or  more. 

The  bird  weighs  less  which  spreads  itself  out  more,  and  conversely 
that  weighs  more  which  draws  itself  together  more  tightly;  and  the 
butterflies  make  experiments  of  this  in  their  descents.  e  43  v. 


HOW  THE  BIRD  FALLING  HEAD  DOWNWARDS  HAS  TO 
GUIDE  ITSELF 

The  bird  that  falls  head  downwards  guides  itself  by  bending  its  tail 
towards  its  back.  This  is  proved  by  the  tenth  which  says: — the  centre 
of  a  heavy  object  that  descends  in  the  air  will  always  remain  below  the 
centre  of  its  lightest  part.  Therefore  as  c  d  the  central  line  of  the  gravity 
of  the  bird  is  at  a  distance  from  a  b  the  central  line  of  the  levity  of  the 
tail  of  this  bird,  the  two  lines  will  necessarily  form  the  same  line  over  a 
short  space  of  the  descent  of  this  bird.  And  this  being  so  one  must 
needs  admit  that  the  direct  descent  will  of  necessity  become  a  slant 
and  in  becoming  a  slant  the  descent  will  be  as  much  slower  as  the 
movement  is  longer,  or  that  the  movement  will  be  as  much  longer  as 
the  descent  is  slower,  and  as  much  longer  and  slower  as  the  descent 
is  more  slanting. 


HOW  THE  BIRD  STEADIES  ITSELF  AS  IT  FALLS  BACKWARDS 

But  if  the  bird  turns  over  in  the  air  because  of  the  wind  the  tail 
ought  to  close  up  as  much  as  it  can  and  the  wings  rise  behind  the  head. 
And  with  the  part  in  front  of  the  centre  it  becomes  heavy  and  with 
that  behind  light,  the  centre  of  gravity  not  being  in  the  centre  of  its 
volume;  and  by  the  ninth  which  says: — the  fact  that  the  centre  of  the 
volume  is  not  concentric  with  the  centre  of  gravity  is  the  reason  why 
the  body  in  which  these  centres  are  contained  will  never  remain  in  a 
state  of  equilibrium  with  its  greatest  breadth;  and  by  the  tenth  of 


456  FLIGHT 

this: — the  centre  of  the  gravity  of  bodies  suspended  in  the  air  will  al- 
ways be  below  the  centre  of  the  volume  of  the  same  bodies,     e  44  r. 

Why  the  bird  makes  use  of  the  helm  placed  in  the  front  of  the  wings 
although  it  has  other  ways  of  curving  its  straight  movement: 

The  bird  only  makes  use  of  one  of  the  helms  placed  in  the  front  of 
its  wings  when  it  wishes  to  bend  its  straight  movement  into  a  level 
position. 

When  however  it  comes  to  pass  that  this  bending  process  is  complex, 
that  is  it  is  a  slanting  curve,  it  will  then  draw  in  one  of  its  wings  a 
little,  and  thus  will  make  a  curved  movement  which  will  descend  on 
that  side  on  which  the  wing  is  drawn  in,  showing  there  the  convex 
movement. 

But  such  a  process  as  this  involves  the  danger  of  its  turning  over  on 
its  side  and  leaving  the  point  of  the  wing  extended  towards  the  sky, 
and  as  a  means  of  protection  against  this  it  is  necessary  to  extend  the 
wing  that  is  drawn  in,  always  showing  the  under  side  of  the  wing  to 
the  ground,  for  if  you  were  to  show  it  the  right  side  the  bird  would 
turn  upside  down.  When  therefore  in  these  conditions  you  have  ex- 
tended the  folded  wing  towards  the  ground  you  will  at  the  same  time 
gather  up  the  upper  wing  which  was  extended,  until  such  time  as  you 
return  to  a  position  of  equality. 

In  having  shown  one  of  the  dangers  which  occur  to  deflect  the 
straight  movement  of  the  birds  in  the  air,  by  disturbing  the  equal  re- 
sistance which  wings  make  when  they  are  equally  open  upon  the  air 
and  have  their  centre  of  gravity  between  them  midway  between  their 
extremities,  we  have  at  the  same  time  proved  that  it  is  safer  to  bend 
one  of  the  two  helms  of  the  winds  than  it  is  to  bend  one  of  the  two 
wings.  e  44  v. 

WHICH  OF  THE  MOVEMENTS  OF  THE  WINGS  IS  THE- 

SWIFTEST 

The  movement  of  the  wings  is  twofold  inasmuch  as  part  of  tru. 
movement  descends  towards  the  earth  and  part  towards  the  place  from 
whence  the  bird  is  flying.  But  that  part  of  the  movement  which  is 


FLIGHT  457 

made  inwards  the  earth  checks  the  bird's  descent  and  the  backward 
movement  drives  it  forward. 

What  it  is  in  the  bird  that  causes  it  to  bend  its  straight  movement 
without  it  either  descending  or  raising  itself: 

The  bird  bends  its  straight  movement  made  in  a  position  of  equi- 
librium without  raising  or  lowering  itself,  by  means  of  the  right  or 
left  helm  placed  in  the  front  part  of  the  wings.  This  is  proved  thus: 
let  a  p  o  g  be  the  bird  which  moving  in  a  position  of  equilibrium 
bends  the  straight  movement  m  p  a  to  the  curving  movement  a  b 
by  means  of  the  helm  t  which  is  set  in  the  front  part  of  the  left  wing, 
and  this  comes  about  by  the  ninth  of  this  which  says : — the  bodies  with 
equal  sides  about  the  central  line  of  their  gravity  will  always  keep  the 
straight  line  of  their  movement  in  the  air — and  if  the  volume  of  one  of 
the  sides  is  increased  or  diminished  the  straight  movement  will  de- 
scribe a  curve,  showing  the  concave  part  of  the  curve  on  the  side  of 
the  greater  inequality  of  the  thing  that  is  moved.  e  45  r. 


OF  THE  UNDERSIDE  OF  THE  WINGS  [with  drawing] 

They  form  coverings  one  to  the  other  b  to  a,  the  resisting  parts  of 
the  feathers  beneath  the  wings  of  the  birds  behind  the  flight  of  the  air 
or  wind,  so  that  this  air  or  wind  shuts  up  a  part  of  the  feathers  that 
offer  weak  resistance  upon  the  opposite  feathers  which  offer  powerful 
resistance. 


WHY  THE  FEEBLE  RESISTANCES  ARE  BENEATH  THE 
POWERFUL  ONES 

The  feathers  that  offer  a  feeble  resistance  are  set  beneath  those  which 
ofTer  a  powerful  resistance  with  their  extremities  turned  towards  the 
tail  of  the  bird,  because  the  air  underneath  flying  things  is  thicker  than 
it  is  above  them  and  in  front  than  it  is  behind;  and  the  necessity  of 
flight  brings  it  about  that  these  lateral  extremities  of  the  wings  are  not 
found  by  the  stroke  of  the  wind  because  then  they  would  immediately 
become  spread  out  and  separated  one  from  another,  and  would  be 
instantly  penetrated  by  the  wind.  Consequently  these  resistances  being 
so  placed  that  the  parts  which  have  a  convex  curve  are  turned  towards 


458  FLIGHT 

the  sky,  the  more  they  are  struck  by  the  wind  the  more  they  lower 
themselves  and  draw  closer  to  the  lower  resistances  with  which  they 
are  in  contact,  and  so  prevent  the  entry  of  the  wind  beneath  the  front 
of  the  lateral  parts  of  these  resistances. 

WHAT  TEXTURE  OF  AIR  SURROUNDS  BIRDS  AS  THEY  FLY 

The  air  which  surrounds  the  birds  is  as  much  lighter  above  than  the 
ordinary  lightness  of  the  other  air  as  it  is  heavier  below,  and  as  much 
lighter  behind  than  above  as  the  bird's  movement  is  swifter  in  its 
transverse  course  than  is  that  of  its  wings  towards  the  ground,  and 
similarly  the  heaviness  of  the  air  is  greater  in  front  of  the  contact  of 
the  bird  than  below  it  in  proportion  to  the  two  above  mentioned 
degrees  of  lightness  of  the  air. 

The  straight  movement  of  birds  in  the  air  forms  a  curve  towards  the 
side  on  which  the  wing  is  drawn  together,  and  this  arises  entirely  out 
of  the  fact  that  every  heavy  body  descends  on  that  side  on  which  it  has 
less  resistance;  this  movement  therefore  may  be  described  as  a  complex 
curve  formed  out  of  a  lateral  curve  and  the  declining  curve  made  by 
the  bird  upon  that  side  which  is  lower  than  itself.  e  45  v. 

OF  RAISING  AND  LOWERING  THE  WINGS 

Birds  raise  their  wings  when  open  with  greater  ease  than  they  lower 
them.  And  this  is  proved  by  the  third  of  this  which  says: — parts  of 
bodies  which  are  convex  are  more  suitable  for  penetrating  the  air  than 
those  which  are  concave. 

It  follows  that  as  birds  have  their  wings  convex  on  the  side  that  is 
uppermost  and  concave  on  the  side  below  they  will  raise  their  wings 
with  greater  ease  than  they  lower  them. 

OF  THE  SPREADING  OUT  OF  THE  FEATHERS  AS  THE 
WINGS  ARE  RAISED 

The  feathers  spread  out  one  from  another  in  the  wings  of  birds  when 
these  wings  are  raised  up,  and  this  happens  because  the  wing  rises  and 
penetrates  the  thickness  of  the  air  with  greater  ease  when  it  is  per- 
forated than  when  it  is  united. 


FLIGHT  459 

OF  THE  CLOSING  UP  OF  THE  FEATHERS  AS  THE  WINGS 

ARE  LOWERED 

The  spaces  between  the  feathers  in  the  wings  of  birds  contract  as  the 
wings  are  lowered,  in  order  that  these  wings  by  becoming  united  may 
prevent  the  air  from  penetrating  between  these  feathers,  and  that  with 
their  percussion  they  may  have  a  more  powerful  stroke  to  press  and 
condense  the  air  that  is  struck  by  these  wings. 

OF  THE  RESISTANCES  OF  THE  FEATHERS  IN  THE  WINGS 

OF  BIRDS 

The  resistances  of  the  feathers  in  the  wings  of  birds  form  with  their 
powerful  curves  shields  one  of  another  in  the  upper  part  against  the 
penetration  of  the  air  or  the  onset  of  the  wind,  so  that  this  wind  may 
not  as  it  enters  cause  them  to  spread  themselves  out  and  raising  open 
them  and  so  separate  the  feathers  one  from  another. 

It  is  shown  here  below  how  as  the  feathers  under  the  wings  in  order 
to  support  themselves  have  to  rest  and  rub  themselves  upon  the  air 
which  sustains  them,  part  of  the  resistance  that  there  is  in  the  feathers 
remains  beneath  the  strong  part  of  the  other  feathers,  for  the  feathers 
underneath  the  wings  have  their  long  weak  portions  situated  under- 
neath the  short  strong  parts  of  the  next  row  of  feathers. 

Why  the  sinews  beneath  the  birds'  wings  are  more  powerful  than 
those  above.  It  is  done  for  the  movement: 

The  shoulder  where  the  helm  of  the  wing  is  placed  is  hollow  below 
after  the  manner  of  a  spoon,  and  being  thus  concave  below  it  is  convex 
above.  It  is  fashioned  thus  in  order  that  the  process  of  rising  may  be 
easy  and  that  of  lowering  itself  difficult  and  may  meet  with  resistance, 
and  especially  it  is  of  use  to  go  forward  drawing  itself  back  in  the 
manner  of  a  file.  e  46  r. 

OF  THE  EXTREMITIES  OF  THE  WINGS  WHEN  RAISED 

The  extremities  of  the  wings  when  raised  to  their  maximum  height 

are  farther  away  from  each  other  than  when  lowered  as  far  as  possible. 

And   when   these   wings   re-ascend   their   extremities   continue   the 


460  FLIGHT 

descent  that  has  been  begun  until  they  straighten  the  curve  that  they 
have  formed,  and  then  bend  in  the  opposite  curve  and  continue  it 
nearly  to  the  end  of  their  elevation;  and  as  the  wings  recede  from  this 
elevation  the  extremities  pursue  the  elevation  that  has  been  begun 
until  the  first  curve  has  been  destroyed  and  another  has  been  formed 
in  the  contrary  direction. 

In  the  impetus  made  in  the  air  by  the  birds  it  is  better  and  easier  to 
bend  a  part  of  the  wings  than  the  whole.  The  part  of  the  bird  which 
bends  in  the  air  will  cause  the  whole  of  it  to  bend,  as  one  sees  happen 
to  a  ship  through  the  turning  of  its  rudder. 

By  what  has  been  said  above  the  points  of  the  wings  produce  a 
greater  movement  than  is  demanded  by  their  length  since  they  are  not 
flexible.  This  is  proved: — let  there  be  the  movement  of  the  points  of 
the  wings  which  are  flexible  a  c  and  of  those  which  are  not  flexible 
b  d\  the  movement  a  c  of  the  flexible  extremities  of  the  wings  exceeds 
b  d  the  movement  of  the  non-flexible  wings,  and  of  these  two  lines  of 
movement  the  one  is  proved  to  be  less  than  the  other  because  the  one 
is  part  of  the  other. 

But  because  the  points  of  the  wings  as  they  are  raised  and  lowered 
make  a  less  movement  than  the  parts  of  the  feathers  joined  to  them, 
and  before  these  points  of  the  wings  commence  to  extend  the  parts  of 
the  feathers  united  to  these  points  they  turn  in  a  contrary  movement, 
it  is  necessary  for  part  of  the  extremity  of  these  feathers  to  turn  back 
with  the  rest  of  the  feather,  and  for  the  point  to  come  forward  like  a 
finger  that  raises  itself  as  much  as  the  hand  descends,  which  finger  one 
would  describe  as  immovable  because  it  does  not  change  its  position; 
and  for  this  reason  we  may  say  that  the  point  of  the  flexible  wing  has 
a  movement  resembling  that  of  the  wings  that  are  not  flexible. 

e  46  v. 


WHETHER  THE  CURVES  OF  THE  END  PARTS  OF  THE  WINGS 
ARE  NECESSARY  OR  NOT 

The  air  which  is  underneath  the  curves  of  the  end  parts  of  the  wings 
as  they  descend  is  more  compressed  than  any  other  portion  of  the  air 
that  is  found  underneath  the  bird,  and  this  is  brought  about  by  the 
beating  of  the  wings.  This  is  proved  bv  the  seventh  which  treats  of 


FLIGHT  461 

percussion,  where  it  is  stated  that  percussion  is  greater  in  proportion 
as  the  movement  of  that  which  strikes  is  more  long  continuing.  There- 
fore in  the  case  of  the  whole  wing  descending  at  the  same  time  that 
part  has  most  rapid  movement  which  is  most  distant  from  the  fixed 
part,  and  as  a  consequence  that  air  is  most  compressed  which  is  struck 
by  the  swiftest  blow.  It  follows  also  that  the  flexion  of  the  point  of 
the  wing  is  after  the  manner  of  a  spring  or  a  bow  bent  by  force,  and 
that  this  process  of  bending  compresses  the  air  with  which  it  comes  in 
contact. 

But  when  these  wings  rise  up  their  points  follow  the  line  of  their 
descent  until  they  straighten  themselves  and  then  they  bend  back  in  the 
opposite  direction,  that  is  that  if  the  concavity  which  there  is  in  the 
end  of  the  wing  as  it  descends  turns  towards  the  sky  the  concavity  of 
the  same  end  as  the  wing  rises  will  be  turned  towards  the  earth. 

That  part  of  the  shaft  is  most  rapid  which  is  furthest  away  from  its 
motive  power,  and  the  proportion  of  speed  to  speed  is  as  the  distance, 
the  shaft  as  it  moves  not  bending.  e  47  r. 

If  the  movement  of  the  wind  had  uniform  power  in  its  expanse  the 
bird  would  not  be  so  often  engaged  in  beating  the  wind  and  balancing 
itself  with  its  wings. 

The  air  in  itself  is  capable  of  being  compressed  and  rarefied  to  an 
infinite  degree. 


WHETHER  THE  FOLDS  IN  THE  EXTREMITIES  OF  THE 
WINGS  ARE  NECESSARY  OR  NOT 

The  curve  which  is  created  in  the  extreme  parts  of  the  wings  when 
these  wings  strike  and  press  upon  the  air  which  is  condensed  beneath 
them  has  the  effect  of  greatly  increasing  the  bird's  power  of  flight,  for 
in  addition  to  pressing  on  the  air  that  is  below  them  they  compress  the 
adjacent  lateral  air,  by  the  fourth  of  the  second  which  says  'every 
violence  seeks  to  undo  itself  on  the  very  lines  of  the  movement  which 
has  produced  it';  and  by  the  seventh  'every  straightness  which  is  bent 
by  force  has  the  lines  of  its  power  converging  in  the  centre  of  a  com- 
plete circle  formed  by  the  curve  commenced  by  this  extremity  of  wing'. 
As  if  the  wing  abed  being  curved  at  its  extremity  c  d  £,  I  come  to 


462  FLIGHT 

finish  the  circle  c  d  b  r  of  which  the  centre  is  n,  and  from  this  1  draw 
the  line  n  f  touching  the  point  of  the  wing;  and  the  others  will  be  the 
lines  n  e  and  n  /,  and  thus  in  the  centre  are  the  infinite  images  of  the 
others. 

And  by  what  is  said  below  all  these  lines  have  the  same  boundaries 
as  the  curve  of  the  wings  b  d  c  by  the  rule  of  the  perpendicular;  there- 
fore the  force  of  this  extremity  of  wing  b  d  c  is  directed  along  the  lines 
b  /,  d  e,  c  m>  and  of  these  b  f  is  outside  the  space  occupied  by  the  bird 
as  the  line  b  o  informs  us.  e  47  v. 

OF  FLYING  THINGS 

If  the  lateral  parts  change  from  a  position  of  equilibrium  the  straight 
slanting  movement  will  change  to  a  curved  slanting  movement. 

The  bird  which  after  its  descent  is  thrown  back  in  the  air  will  never 
regain  its  former  height  unless  it  beats  its  wings  and  has  the  help  of 
the  wind. 

The  bird  that  drops  down  before  the  approach  of  the  wind  with  a 
straight  slant  will  always  have  its  reflex  movement  more  raised  than  its 
falling  movement. 

The  curving  slant  that  is  seen  to  occur  when  birds  are  flying  to  meet 
the  approaching  wind  with  a  falling  reflex  movement  is  much  more 
steady  than  the  same  movements  made  in  a  straight  slant. 

OF  REFLEX  WINDS 

If  the  birds  are  driven  by  the  wind  without  beating  their  wings  and 
the  wind  meets  the  wall  set  over  against  it,  in  avoiding  this  wall  [the 
bird]  immediately  encounters  the  reflex  wind. 

If  the  bird  moves  towards  the  north  upon  the  wind  and  the  wind 
wishes  to  turn  it  to  the  east,  the  bird  in  order  not  to  spoil  the  equal 
expanse  of  wing  which  keeps  it  at  its  maximum  levity  will  lower  the 
right  tip  of  the  tail  and  receive  the  stroke  of  the  wind  upon  it  more 
than  it  does  upon  the  left  tip,  keeping  thus  its  straight  movement 
direct  to  the  north  upon  the  wind.  e  48  r. 


FLIGHT  463 

OF  THE  THINGS  THAT  MOVE  IN  THE  AIR  AND  THEIR 

DESCENT 

A  parallel  board  of  uniform  thickness  and  weight  placed  flat  in  a 
position  of  equality  in  uniform  resistance  will  descend  uniformly  in 
each  of  its  parts.  And  if  this  board  is  placed  in  the  air  in  a  slanting 
position  the  descent  will  slant  uniformly,  and  this  is  proved  in  its 
place. 

The  shape  of  the  front  part  or  back  part  of  the  thing  that  moves  in 
the  air  or  water  is  what  bends  its  straight  course. 

An  irregularity  attached  either  in  front  or  behind  the  extremities  of 
the  equality  that  moves  in  the  air  is  what  diverts  to  right  or  left  or  up 
or  down  or  in  some  slant  the  straight  movement  of  the  aforesaid 
equality. 

A  bird  which  descends  with  a  straight  slant  in  one  direction  will  not 
change  the  equal  position  of  its  side  parts. 

A  bird  in  the  air  makes  itself  heavy  or  light  whenever  it  pleases;  and 
it  does  this  by  spreading  out  its  wings  and  expanding  its  tail  when  it 
wishes  to  check  its  swift  descent,  or  by  contracting  wings  and  tail 
when  it  wishes  to  quicken  a  descent  which  has  been  delayed. 

e  48  v. 

The  helms  placed  on  the  shoulders  of  the  wings  are  [formed]  of 
very  strong  feathers  because  they  bear  a  greater  strain  than  all  the 
other  feathers. 

[Figure]  a  b  the  helms  of  the  wings  come  into  use  when  the  bird  is 
in  swift  descent.  When  it  wishes  to  capture  its  prey  and  to  turn  from 
one  direction  to  another  without  checking  its  movement  it  uses  these 
helms,  and  if  these  were  not  there  it  would  be  necessary  for  it  to  em- 
ploy the  whole  wing,  and  this  by  reason  of  its  size  would  greatly  hin- 
der the  movement  commenced,  contrary  to  its  intention. 

OF  THE  SLANTING  MOVEMENT  OF  BIRDS 

The  bird  which  consumes  the  impetus  against  the  coming  of  the 
wind  with  its  wings  open  without  any  movement,  except  for  their 
accessary  balancing,  if  it  finds  itself  above  this  wind,  will  always  rise, 


464  FLIGHT 

but  with  greater  or  less  increase  of  height  as  the  impulse  which  moves 
it  is  of  greater  or  less  power  and  of  less  or  greater  slant  in  itself. 

But  if  the  bird  moves  without  beating  its  wings  underneath  the 
wind  the  impetus  will  be  consumed  in  the  descent  of  the  bird  but  the 
impetus  will  be  the  more  permanent  as  the  descent  is  less  slanting. 

If  the  bird  moves  with  its  wings  open  and  without  beating  them,  at 
the  same  time  as  the  wind  and  in  the  same  direction,  this  bird  will 
then  acquire  a  degree  of  descent  with  each  degree  of  movement;  but 
this  descent  will  be  as  much  more  slanting  as  the  wind  is  swifter,  as  is 
proved  when  heavy  substances  are  thrown  into  running  water. 

And  if  a  bird  is  struck  behind  and  below  by  the  wind  then  the  bird 
will  rise  up,  but  this  is  only  done  on  very  rare  occasions  by  birds,  be- 
cause such  a  movement  turns  the  feathers  over  and  down  so  that  they 
point  towards  the  head  of  the  bird.  e  49  r.

When  the  bird  is  driven  by  the  wind  it  proceeds  continually  to 
descend  by  a  slanting  movement,  and  when  it  desires  to  rise  to  its 
former  height  it  turns  backwards  and  uses  the  impetus  of  the  wind  as 
a  wedge. 

Science 

The  impetus  that  the  bird  acquires  by  its  falling  movement  may  be 
reflected  in  each  direction  by  a  movement  that  is  either  straight  or  a 
gradual  curve  whichever  it  may  be  until  this  impetus  is  consumed. 

Rule 

When  the  bird  struck  beneath  the  right  side  by  the  wind  desires  to 
descend  upon  some  spot  it  lowers  the  one  of  its  wings  upon  the  side 
where  it  wishes  to  settle. 

Science 

The  bird  that  desires  rapidly  to  consume  the  impetus  it  has  acquired 
turns  its  wings  in  their  full  extent  against  the  spot  where  it  wishes  to 
halt — and  this  it  does  without  the  help  of  the  wind. 


FLIGHT  465 

When  a  bird  desires  to  rise  straight  up  without  the  wind  by  means 
of  beating  its  wings  the  turning  movement  is  necessary. 

But  if  the  bird's  movement  is  to  be  in  a  straight  line  without  the 
help  of  the  wind  it  is  necessary  that  the  movement  should  be  made  by 
frequent  beatings  of  the  wings,  and  for  this  cause  the  movement  will 
be  extremely  slanting.  e  49  v- 


THEORY  OF  FLYING  THINGS 

The  movement  made  by  a  movable  thing  which  is  long  in  shape 
and  of  uniform  sides  round  about  its  centre-line  will  take  a  straight 
course  through  the  air  for  so  long  a  time  as  the  impetus  lent  to  it  by  its 
mover  lives  within  it. 

The  bird  which  flies  in  a  curved  line  in  a  level  position  moves  one 
wing  with  a  longer  and  more  rapid  movement  than  the  other,  but 
such  movement  does  not  raise  or  lower  the  one  wing  more  than  the 
other. 

But  if  the  curved  movement  of  birds  is  made  up  of  curve  and  slant, 
then  in  addition  to  the  movement  in  one  wing  being  swifter  and 
longer  than  in  the  other  the  one  wing  will  also  go  higher  and  lower 
than  the  other.  And  this  is  proved  by  the  fourth  which  says,  'wings  of 
equal  movement  propel  the  bird  in  a  straight  line',  and  by  the  con- 
verse 'wings  of  which  the  movement  is  unequal  in  length  make  a 
curved  movement'.  And  if  the  movement  of  wings  which  are  unequal 
is  of  equal  height  but  of  varying  length  the  movement  of  the  bird  will 
then  be  a  curve  in  a  level  position.  And  if  the  movement  of  the  wings 
in  addition  to  being  unequal  in  length  is  also  unequal  in  height  and 
depth,  this  being  more  in  the  case  of  one  wing  than  the  other,  this 
movement  is  composed  of  curve  and  slant.  e  50  r. 

OF  THE  REVOLVING  MOVEMENT 

[With  three  sketches  of  a  top  spinning] 

The  pegtop  or  'chalmone'  which  by  the  rapidity  of  its  revolving- 
movement  forgoes  the  power  that  comes  from  the  inequality  of  its 
weight  round  the  centre  about  which  it  revolves,  on  account  of  the 
impetus  that  controls  this  body,  is  a  body  which  will  never  have  such  a 


466  FLIGHT 

tendency  to  fall  as  the  inequality  of  its  weight  desires,  so  long  as  the 
power  of  the  impetus  that  moves  this  body  does  not  become  less  than 
the  power  of  this  inequality. 

But  when  the  power  of  the  inequality  exceeds  the  power  of  the 
impetus  it  makes  itself  the  centre  of  the  revolving  motion  and  so  this 
body  brought  to  a  recumbent  position  completes  upon  this  centre  the 
remainder  of  the  aforesaid  impetus. 

And  when  the  power  of  the  inequality  is  equal  to  the  power  of  the 
impetus  the  top  is  bent  obliquely,  and  the  two  powers  contend  in  a 
concerted  movement  and  move  one  another  in  a  great  circuit  until  the 
centre  of  the  second  variety  of  revolving  movement  is  established,  and 
in  this  the  impetus  ends  its  power.  e  50  v. 

The  rows  of  feathers  on  the  wings  placed  one  above  the  other  are 
set  there  for  the  purpose  of  strengthening  the  largest  feathers. 

Make  first  the  anatomy  of  the  birds,  then  that  of  their  wings  stripped 
of  feathers  and  then  with  the  feathers. 

Parallel  lines  which  between  their  extremities  are  equidistant  from 
the  same  point  are  always  curved,  and  the  one  is  shorter  than  the  other 
if  they  are  in  contact  with  the  two  sides  of  the  same  triangle. 

All  the  feathers  of  the  wings  that  grow  beneath  the  penultimate 
feathers  of  the  same  wings  are  in  process  of  bending  during  the  bird's 
flight,  and  the  most  flexible  are  those  which  do  not  form  a  covering 
one  to  another,  that  is  those  which  are  pierced  during  the  flight. 

In  order  that  a  bird  flying  against  the  wind  may  be  able  to  settle  on 
a  high  spot  it  has  to  fly  above  the  spot  and  then  turn  back  and  without 
beating  its  wings  descend  upon  the  above-mentioned  place.  This  is 
proved,  for  if  the  bird  should  wish  to  abandon  its  flight  in  order  to 
settle,  the  wind  would  throw  it  backwards,  and  this  cannot  happen 
when  it  acts  in  the  aforesaid  manner. 

If  the  flight  of  the  bird  is  conditioned  by  the  length  of  the  bird  and 
the  wind  strikes  it  on  the  side  the  movement  of  its  flight  must  needs 
be  between  its  length  and  the  said  side:  as  though  the  bird  a  b  should 
wish  to  fly  from  a  to  c  and  the  wind  /  should  strike  it  on  the  flank  or 
at  the  side,  this  bird  will  then  direct  its  movement  by  the  line  a  g,  and 
the  wind  will  continually  bend  the  movement  along  the  curve  m  n  c\ 
thus  it  will  go  where  it  wishes  and  will  find  itself  at  the  spot  marked  c. 


FLIGHT  467 

But  should  the  wind  deflect  the  bird's  course  in  a  more  pronounced 
curve  than  its  will  consents  to,  the  bird  will  then  resume  its  flight 
against  the  wind  as  it  did  at  first,  and  then  with  a  second  curving 
movement  the  wind  will  lead  it  to  the  desired  place.  e  51  r. 

Whether  or  no  equal  striking  forces  made  with  equal  lengths  of 
movement  at  different  times  will  create  equal  lengths  of  movement  in 
the  objects  moved:  this  is  answered  by  the  seventh  of  the  ninth  which 
says: — among  moving  forces  of  equal  powers  and  of  movements  united 
with  their  objects  moved,  that  which  divides  its  movable  thing  most 
swiftly  from  itself  will  be  that  which  will  move  this  movable  thing 
farthest  from  itself.  At  this  point  the  adversary  says  that  moving 
forces  of  equal  power  will  not  vary  their  speed  and  cannot  therefore 
with  similar  movement  drive  one  of  two  equal  movable  things  farther 
from  them  than  the  other.  The  reply  to  this  is  that  there  are  two  kinds 
of  moving  forces  of  which  one  is  sensitive  and  the  other  is  not:  that 
which  is  sensitive  has  life,  and  the  other  is  without  life.  But  that  which 
has  life  moves  its  movable  things  by  means  of  the  expansion  and  con- 
traction of  the  muscles  that  form  parts  of  its  limbs,  this  expansion  and 
contraction  being  made  with  a  greater  or  less  amount  of  speed  with 
the  same  power,  the  cause  that  is  swiftest  not  being  the  most  powerful. 

No  other  difference  is  found  except  that  the  greater  or  less  speed 
compresses  more  or  less  the  air  through  which  the  arm  of  the  moving 
force  is  exerted.  But  the  insensitive  moving  force  such  as  catapults  or 
mangonels  or  other  similar  engines  which  by  means  of  trapezes  or  by 
the  force  of  cords  or  bent  wood  drive  forth  from  themselves.  .  .  . 

The  bird  which  one  sees,  carried  on  by  its  impetus,  flying  higher 
than  the  spot  on  which  it  desires  to  settle,  spreads  out  its  tail  and 
lowers  it;  and  striking  the  air  with  it  in  the  course  of  its  movement  it 
bends  its  straight  course  and  causes  it  to  curve  and  makes  it  end  upon 
the  spot  where  it  settles  down. 

The  kite  which  descends  to  the  east  with  a  great  slant  with  the  wind 
in  the  north  wall  have  its  movement  bent  to  the  south-east  by  this  wind 
unless  it  lowers  the  right  tip  of  its  tail  and  bends  its  movement  slightly 
to  the  north-east.  This  is  proved  thus: — let  a  b  c  d  be  the  bird, 
moving  to  the  east  in  the  direction  n  m,  and  the  north  wind  strikes  it 
crosswise  by  the  line  /  n,  and  would  cause  it  to  bend  to  the  south-east 


468  FLIGHT 

if  it  were  not  that  it  has  the  right  tip  of  the  tail  lowered  to  meet  the 
wind,  as  it  strikes  it  behind  the  centre  of  gravity  over  a  longer  space 
than  existed  in  front  of  this  centre  of  gravity,  and  so  its  straight  move- 
ment is  not  deflected.1  e  52  r. 

When  the  bird  desires,  with  its  wings  extended,  to  make  a  circular 
movement  which  shall  raise  it  to  a  height  with  the  help  of  the  wind,  it 
lowers  one  of  its  wings  and  one  of  the  tips  of  its  tail  towards  the  centre 
of  the  circle  in  which  it  is  revolving. 

And  when  the  movement  of  the  bird  is  circular  in  order  to  raise 
itself  to  a  height  without  beating  its  wings  it  receives  the  wind  under 
one  of  its  wings  over  a  fourth  part  of  this  circle;  and  in  this  way  the 
wind  makes  itself  a  wedge  and  raises  it  up.  It  would  turn  it  upside 
down  if  it  were  not  that  the  other  wing  supported  it  and  sustained  it 
upon  the  air  which  strikes  with  a  whirling  movement  underneath  this 
wing,  which  is  the  one  that  was  struck  and  pressed  together  beneath 
the  other  wing. 

THINGS  THAT  FLY 

The  helms  formed  on  the  shoulders  of  the  wings  of  birds  are  pro- 
vided by  resourceful  nature  as  a  convenient  means  of  deflecting  the 
direct  impetus  which  often  takes  place  during  the  headlong  flight  of 
birds,  for  a  bird  finds  it  much  more  convenient  to  bend  by  direct 
force  one  of  the  smallest  parts  of  the  wings  than  the  whole  of  them; 
and  this  is  why  their  feathers  are  made  very  small  and  very  strong  so 
that  they  may  serve  as  a  cover  for  one  another  and  by  so  doing  arm 
and  fortify  each  other  with  marvellous  power.  And  these  feathers  have 
their  base  in  the  small  and  very  thick  bones,  moved  by  the  sinews 
which  bend  them  over  their  joints  and  which  are  very  great  in  these 
wings. 

The  movement  and  position  of  these  bones  on  the  shoulders  of  the 
wings  is  ordered  and  established  in  the  same  way  as  the  thumb  in  the 
human  hand,  which  being  in  the  centre  of  the  four  sinews  that  sur- 
round it  at  the  base  with  four  equal  spaces  between  them,  produces  by 
means  of  these  sinews  an  infinite  number  of  movements  both  curved 
and  straight.

FLIGHT  469 

We  may  say  the  same  of  the  rudder  placed  behind  the  movement  oi 

the  ship,  imitated  from  the  tails  of  birds;  as  to  which  experience 
teaches  ns  how  much,  more  readily  this  small  rudder  is  turned  during 
the  rapid  movements  of  great  ships  than  the  whole  ship  itself. 

Why  the  inventors  of  ships  do  not  place  their  rudders  in  front  as  is 
the  case  with  the  rudder  placed  in  front  of  the  shoulders  of  the  wings: 

This  was  not  done  with  ships  because  the  waves  of  the  water  are 
thrown  up  in  the  air  to  such  a  great  height  when  smitten  by  the 
impetuous  blow  of  the  moving  ship  as  would  render  the  movement  of 
the  rudder  very  difficult  from  the  gravity  it  would  have  acquired,  and 
moreover  it  would  often  get  broken.  But  since  air  within  air  has  no 
weight  but  has  condensation  which  is  very  useful  the  rudders  (or 
helms)  of  the  wings  have  a  better  use  in  a  thick  substance  than  in  a 
thin  one,  the  thick  offering  more  resistance  than  the  thin.  The  ship 
does  the  same  in  the  added  gravity  of  the  water  as  has  been  said,  and 
for  this  reason  the  rudder  has  been  placed  behind  the  ship  where  the 
water  furrowed  and  cleft  open  by  its  course  falls  back  from  the  dikes 
which  have  been  made  in  the  depth  of  the  hollow  created,  and  in  its 
descent  strikes  the  rudder  with  greater  or  less  power  as  the  falling 
water  strikes  it  at  angles  greater  or  less;  and  in  addition  to  this  the 
volume  of  water  pent  up  in  the  centre  of  the  said  concavity  falls  with 
impetus  at  the  blow  of  the  rudder  as  has  been  stated. 

But  at  the  tail  of  the  kite  there  is  the  stroke  of  the  air  which  presses 
with  fury  closing  up  the  void  which  the  movement  of  the  bird  leaves 
of  itself,  and  this  occurs  on  each  side  of  the  void  so  created. 

The  void  which  the  bird  leaves  of  itself  successively  as  it  penetrates 
:n  the  air  is  struck  on  its  sides  by  that  part  of  the  bird  which  most 
exceeds  the  space  about  its  central  line. 

If  the  percussion  which  the  sides  of  the  bird  make  on  the  sides  of 
the  air  they  penetrate,  with  those  parts  that  is  which  are  at  the  greatest 
distance  from  the  centre  line  of  their  movement,  is  above  the  middle  of 
its  right  side,  then  the  straight  movement  will  curve  towards  the  right 
side,  and  if  it  is  below  the  middle  upon  the  opposite  side  this  straight 
movement  will  then  curve  upon  the  left  side;  it  will  also  do  the  same 
if  struck  above  the  middle  of  the  left  side  as  if  struck  below  it  on  the 
left  (right?)  side  and  of  the  side  above  or  of  that  below;  and  of  the 
appearance  of  each  we  will  speak  in  its  place. 


470  FLIGHT 

The  tail  of  the  bird  spread  out  takes  the  same  proportion  of  the 
bird's  whole  weight  as  is  the  proportion  that  the  open  tail  bears  to  the 
other  parts  of  the  bird,  the  bust,  neck,  head  and  open  wings, — and  so 
much  less  in  proportion  as  the  centre  of  gravity  of  the  whole  bird  is 
nearer  the  centre  of  the  bust  than  of  the  tail. 

[The  air]  runs  after  the  vacuum  which  the  bird  leaves  of  itself  as  it 
pierces  the  air  as  much  as  the  bird  flies  forward  in  the  air  which  con- 
tinually receives  its  contact.  Consequently  it  is  not  the  closing  up  of  the 
air  behind  the  bird  that  drives  the  bird  before  it  but  the  impetus  which 
moves  the  bird  forward  opens  and  drives  the  air,  which  becomes  a 
sheath  and  draws  the  air  behind  it. 

The  bird  which  without  moving  its  wings  rises  up  by  the  help  of  the 
wind  descends  half  the  distance  that  it  rises  as  it  moves  above  the 
wind  when  its  tail  is  turned  to  this  wind.  And  as  much  more  as  the 
circle  is  larger.  e  52  v.  and  53  r. 

The  bird  that  flies  with  a  curving  movement  as  it  beats  its  wings 
beats  the  wing  on  the  convex  side  of  this  movement  more  frequently 
and  with  a  longer  movement  than  it  does  on  the  concave  side. 

If  the  bird  were  to  raise  its  wing  above  the  wind  on  the  side  on 
which  it  is  struck  by  this  wind,  this  bird  would  be  turned  upside 
down,  but  for  the  fact  that  the  opposite  wing  is  lowered  and  bent 
underneath  the  percussion  of  the  wind  beyond  the  centre  of  its  gravity, 
which  percussion  would  immediately  restore  it  to  a  position  of  equi- 
librium in  the  tips  of  its  wings. 

The  bird  which  spreads  its  bulk  out  longer  and  thinner  will  have 
its  flight  less  affected  by  the  percussion  of  the  wind  as  it  receives  the 
aforesaid  percussion. 

When  the  bird  has  arranged  itself  so  that  it  receives  the  percussion 
of  the  wind  slantwise,  the  extreme  part  of  the  lower  wing  bends  con- 
siderably and  assumes  the  shape  of  a  foot  and  in  this  way  it  serves 
somewhat  as  a  support  to  the  weight  of  the  bird. 

Birds  with  short  tails  have  very  wide  wings;  by  their  width  they 
take  the  place  of  the  tail,  and  they  make  considerable  use  of  the  helms 
set  on  the  shoulders  of  the  wings  when  they  wish  to  turn  to  any  spot. 

The  bird  that  receives  the  wind  full  in  front  turns  over  as  it  rises 
and  stretches  out  its  neck  towards  the  sky;  and  by  lowering  and  open- 


FLIGHT  471 

ing  its  tail  it  stops  itself  from  turning  over.  And  this  proceeds  Erom  the 
fact  that  a  greater  volume  of  wind  strikes  the  bird  below  its  centre  of 
gravity  than  above  it.  e  53  v- 

In  order  to  give  the  true  science  of  the  movement  of  the  birds  in  the 
air  it  is  necessary  first  to  give  the  science  of  the  winds,  and  this  we  shall 
prove  by  means  of  the  movements  of  the  water.  This  science  is  in  itself 
capable  of  being  received  by  the  senses:  it  will  serve  as  a  ladder  to 
arrive  at  the  perception  of  flying  things  in  the  air  and  the  wind. 

Wind 

The  wind  in  passing  the  summits  of  mountains  becomes  swift  and 
dense  and  as  it  flows  beyond  the  mountains  it  becomes  thin  and  slow, 
like  water  that  issues  forth  from  a  narrow  channel  into  the  wide  sea. 

When  the  bird  passes  from  a  slow  to  a  swift  current  of  the  wind  it 
lets  itself  be  carried  by  this  wind  until  such  time  as  it  has  devised  a 
new  assistance  for  itself,  as  is  proved  in  this  book. 

When  the  bird  moves  with  impetus  against  the  wind  it  makes  long 
quick  beats  of  its  wings  with  a  slanting  movement,  and  after  thus 
beating  its  wings  it  remains  for  a  time  with  all  its  members  contracted 
and  low. 

The  bird  will  be  overturned  by  the  wind  when  in  a  less  slanting 
position  it  so  arranges  itself  as  to  receive  beneath  it  the  percussion  of 
any  lateral  wind. 

But  if  the  bird  that  is  struck  laterally  by  the  wind  is  on  the  point  of 
being  overturned  by  this  wind  it  will  fold  its  upper  wing,  and  so  im- 
mediately go  back  to  the  position  of  having  its  body  turned  towards 
the  ground,  but  if  it  fold  its  lower  wing  it  will  be  immediately  turned 
upside  down  by  the  wind.  e  54  r. 


OF  THE  BIRD'S  MOVEMENT 

Of  whether  birds  when  continually  descending  without  beating  their 
wings  will  proceed  a  greater  distance  in  one  sustained  curve,  or  by 
frequently  making  some  reflex  movement;  and  whether  when  they 
wish  to  pass  in  flight  from  one  spot  to  another  they  will  go  more 


472  FLIGHT 

quickly  by  making  impetuous  headlong  movements,  and  then  rising 
up  with  reflex  movement,  and  again  making  a  fresh  descent,  and  so 
continuing:  to  speak  of  this  subject  you  must  needs  in  the  first  book 
explain  the  nature  of  the  resistance  of  the  air,  in  the  second  the  anat- 
omy of  the  bird  and  of  its  wings,  in  the  third  the  method  of  working 
of  the  wings  in  their  various  movements,  in  the  fourth  the  power  of 
the  wings  and  of  the  tail,  at  such  time  as  the  wings  are  not  being 
moved  and  the  wind  is  favourable,  to  serve  as  a  guide  in  different 
movements. 

Dissect  the  bat,  study  it  carefully,  and  on  this  model  construct  the 
machine. 

OF  SWIMMING  AND  FLIGHT 

When  two  forces  strike  against  each  other  it  is  always  the  swiftest 
which  leaps  backwards.  So  it  is  with  the  hand  of  the  swimmer  when 
it  strikes  and  presses  upon  the  water  and  makes  his  body  glide  away 
with  a  contrary  movement;  so  it  is  also  with  the  wing  of  the  bird  in 
the  air.  f  41  v. 

Before  you  write  about  creatures  which  can  fly  make  a  book  about 
the  insensible  things  which  descend  in  the  air  without  the  wind  and 
another  [on  those]  which  descend  with  the  wind. 

When  the  bird  is  moving  to  the  east  with  the  wind  in  the  north  and 
finds  itself  with  its  left  wing  above  the  said  wind  it  will  be  turned 
over,  unless  at  the  onset  of  this  wind  it  puts  its  left  wing  under  the 
wind  and  by  some  such  movement  throws  itself  towards  the  north- 
east and  under  the  wind.  f  53  v. 

AIR 

Its  onset  is  much  more  rapid  than  that  of  water,  for  the  occasions 
are  many  when  its  wave  flees  from  the  place  of  its  creation  without 
the  water  changing  its  position;  in  the  likeness  of  the  waves  which  in 
May  the  course  of  the  wind  makes  in  the  cornfields,  when  one  sees 
the  waves  running  over  the  fields  without  the  ears  of  corn  changing 
their  place. 

When  the  heavy  substance  descends  in  the  air,  and  this  air  moves  in 
a  contrary  direction  in  order  to  fill  up  continuously  the  space  left  by 


FLIGHT  iji 

this  heavy  substance,  the  movement  of  this  air  is  a  curve,  because  when 
it  desires  to  rise  by  the  shortest  line  it  is  prevented  by  the  heavy  sub- 
stance which  descends  upon  it,  and  so  of  necessity  it  is  obliged  to  bend 
and  then  to  return  above  this  heavy  substance  and  fill  up  the  vacuum 
that  has  been  left  by  it.  And  if  it  were  thus  the  air  would  not  be  com- 
pressed beneath  the  speed  of  the  heavy  substance,  and  this  being  so 
the  birds  would  not  be  able  to  support  themselves  upon  the  air  that  is 
struck  by  them;  but  it  is  necessary  to  say  here  that  the  air  is  com- 
pressed beneath  that  which  strikes  it  and  it  becomes  rarefied  above  in 
order  to  fill  up  the  void  left  by  that  which  has  struck  it.  f  87  v. 


BIRDS  IN  SLANTING  MOVEMENT 

The  adversary  says  that  if  the  bird  is  struck  below  by  the  wind 
this  bird  will  always  rise  up,  and  this  will  not  fail  to  be  the  case  if  the 
bird  be  flying  against  the  wind.  But  if  the  bird  and  the  wind  go  with 
equal  movement  along  the  same  path  it  must  needs  be  that  at  every 
degree  of  movement  made  by  the  wind  the  bird  acquires  a  degree  of 
descent;  we  may  therefore  say  that  in  such  time  as  the  wind  moves  a 
degree  in  a  horizontal  position,  a  degree  to  which  we  may  apply  a 
name  .  .  . 

The  bird  that  flies  in  an  easterly  direction  without  beating  its  wings 
as  it  crosses  the  course  of  the  south  wind  gathers  in  its  right  wing  and 
extends  its  left;  and  this  inequality  of  wings  is  according  to  the  ninth 
of  the  first  which  says:  the  birds  that  support  themselves  without 
beating  their  wings  in  the  course  of  the  wind,  or  descend  through  the 
motionless  air  bend  their  straight  movement  towards  the  side  where 
one  of  the  wings  is  pressed  together. 

Therefore  the  bird  p  flying  along  the  line  a  f  with  an  equal  expan- 
sion of  wings  n  b  will  bend  this  movement  from  c  f  towards  d, 
gathering  in  the  right  wing  from  m  to  n.  g  41  v. 

The  adversary  says  that  if  the  movement  of  the  bird  be  slanting  in 
the  course  of  the  wind  and  made  in  a  position  of  equality,  this  bird 
will  be  struck  by  the  wind  on  the  side  underneath;  and  the  bird  which 
is  struck  underneath  continually  rises  upward. 

Birds  always  fly  low  when  the  course  of  the  wind  is  contrary  to  their 


474  FLIGHT 

pprh,  and  this  teaches  us  how  the  wind  is  more  powerful  at  a  height 
>.Lan  low  down.  Here  the  adversary  says  that  the  wind  which  strikes 
jJie  earth  suddenly  acquires  more  density  than  it  had  at  first,  and  con- 
sequently it  becomes  more  powerful  and  heavier. 

When  the  bird  is  driven  by  the  wind  it  proceeds  to  lower  itself 
continually  with  a  slanting  movement;  and  when  it  wishes  to  raise 
itself  again  to  its  former  altitude,  it  turns  back  with  the  speed  of  the 
impetus  it  has  acquired;  and  this  is  consumed  against  the  wind  which 
acts  as  a  wedge  and  raises  it  to  a  greater  altitude  than  it  left;  from 
thence  it  afterwards  descends  with  the  slant  mentioned  before,  after 
which  it  acts  as  we  said  above,  and  so  continually  acquiring  degrees  of 
altitude  it  raises  itself  at  last  to  the  spot  that  it  desires.  c  42  r. 

The  bird  which  without  beating  its  wings  descends  with  a  great 
slant  beneath  the  approach  of  the  wind  bends  its  straight  course  to- 
wards the  side  where  one  of  its  wings  is  contracted.  g  49  v. 

OF  THE  END  OF  THE  FLIGHT  OF  BIRDS 

The  end  of  the  flight  of  birds  in  certain  species  is  made  with  a 
straight  and  slanting  movement  and  in  others  it  is  made  with  a  curved 
slanting  movement.  But  in  the  case  of  that  which  is  made  with  a 
straight  slant  it  is  necessary  that  this  movement  should  slant  very  con- 
siderably, that  is  that  the  slant  is  almost  horizontal  as  is  shown  in 
m  n  [diagram]. 

And  if  the  movement  of  these  birds  drops  very  much  then  of 
necessity  this  is  intermingled  with  many  reflections,  and  especially 
toward  the  end  as  will  be  shown  in  its  place. 

OF  THE  END  OF  THE  FLIGHT  THAT  IS  MADE  UPWARDS 

FROM  BELOW 

When  it  is  near  the  end  [of  its  flight]  the  bird  makes  itself  slant  only 
a  little  in  its  length,  and  opens  its  wings  and  its  tail  very  widely,  but 
the  wings  reach  this  end  with  frequent  tiny  beats  in  the  course  of 
which  the  impetus  is  consumed,  and  so  as  they  contract  it  remains  for 
a  very  brief  space  above  the  spot  where  it  finally  settles  with  a  very 
slight  percussion  of  its  feet. 


FLIGHT  475 

Bats  when  they  fly  have  of  necessity  their  wings  covered  completely 
with  a  membrane,  because  the  creatures  of  the  night  on  which  they 
feed  seek  to  escape  by  means  of  confused  revolutions  and  this  confusion 
is  enhanced  by  their  various  twists  and  turns.  As  to  the  bats  it  is  neces- 
sary sometimes  that  they  follow  their  prey  upside  down,  sometimes  in 
a  slanting  position,  and  so  in  various  different  ways,  which  they  could 
not  do  without  causing  their  own  destruction  if  their  wings  were  of 
feathers  that  let  the  air  pass  through  them.  g  63  v. 

OF   THE   COMMENCEMENT   OF   BIRDS'   FLIGHT 

When  birds  wish  to  commence  their  flight  it  is  necessary  for  them 
to  do  so  in  one  of  two  ways,  one  of  which  commences  by  lowering 
themselves  with  their  body  to  the  ground  and  then  making  a  leap  in 
the  air  by  extending  very  rapidly  their  folded  legs. 

At  the  close  of  this  leap  the  wings  have  completed  their  extension 
and  the  bird  immediately  lowers  them  swiftly  towards  the  ground  and 
reascends  the  second  stage  which  is  slanting  like  the  first;  and  thus 
continuing  in  succession  it  rises  to  whatsoever  height  it  pleases.  Some 
others  first  raise  their  wings  to  slant  forward  and  lower  themselves  as 
far  as  they  can  with  their  breasts  on  the  ground,  and  in  this  position 
they  extend  their  legs  very  rapidly  leaping  up  and  slanting  forward, 
and  then  at  the  end  of  the  effort  they  drop  their  wings  so  that  they  are 
slanting  downwards  and  backwards.  Thus  they  find  themselves  con- 
siderably above  and  in  front  of  the  place  from  which  they  set  out  and 
at  the  end  of  the  effort  they  are  in  another;  and  so  their  movement 
continues. 

There  are  other  birds  which  after  having  lowered  themselves  to  the 
ground  and  having  their  wings  extended  high  and  forwards,  lower  the 
wings  and  extend  the  legs  at  the  same  time,  and  thus  the  power  pro- 
duced by  the  first  beating  of  the  wings  allied  to  the  power  acquired  by 
extending  the  legs  becomes  very  great,  and  this  power  united  is  the 
greatest  that  it  is  possible  to  create  for  the  beginnings  of  the  flights  of 
these  birds. 

The  second  method  employed  by  birds  at  the  commencement  of 
their  flight  is  when  they  are  descending  from  a  height:  they  merely 
throw  themselves  forward  and  at  the  same  time  spread  their  wings 


476  FLIGHT 

high  and  forwards  and  then  in  the  course  of  the  leap  lower  their  wings 
downwards  and  backwards,  and  so  using  them  as  oars  continue  their 
slanting  descent. 

Others  have  the  habit  of  throwing  themselves  forward  with  wings 
closed  and  then  opening  the  wings  as  they  descend,  and  having  opened 
them  are  stopped  by  the  resistance  of  the  air,  and  then  close  them  and 
fall  again.  g  64  r. 

THE  FLIGHT  OF  THE  FOURTH  SPECIES  OF  BUTTERFLIES 
THE  DEVOURERS  OF  THE  WINGED  ANTS 

The  butterflies  with  four  equal  and  separated  wings  (ant  lions) 
always  fly  with  the  tail  high  using  it  as  a  rudder  for  any  sort  of  move- 
ment. That  is  that  if  one  of  these  insects  wishes  to  descend  it  lowers 
its  tail  and  if  it  wishes  to  ascend  it  raises  its  tail,  and  if  it  wishes  to 
turn  to  the  right  or  left  it  bends  its  tail  to  the  right  or  left  and  the 
same  with  all  sorts  of  angles  of  movement  which  lie  between  the  said 
four  principal  movements.  And  this  is  the  largest  butterfly  of  the  afore- 
said species,  black  and  yellow  in  colour. 

It  uses  its  four  wings  in  short  wheeling  flights  when  it  wishes  to 
prey  on  the  small  winged  ants,  moving  sometimes  the  right  forward 
and  the  left  backward  and  sometimes  the  left  forward  and  the  right 
backward  because  the  rudder  formed  by  the  tail  is  not  sufficient  to 
regulate  the  speed  of  its  movement. 

OF  THE  THREE  CHIEF  POSITIONS  WHICH  THE  WINGS  OF 
BIRDS  ASSUME  AS  THEY  DESCEND 

Of  the  three  chief  positions  which  the  wings  of  birds  assume  as  they 
descend  slantwise  without  beating  their  wings,  the  first  is  a  b  c  in 
which  the  wings  have  their  extremities  of  equal  height  and  so  also  the 
opposite  angles  of  the  tail,  whence  their  movement  will  descend  by  the 
slant  a  d.  The  second  arrangement  will  be  a  e  f,  in  which  the  extrem- 
ities of  the  wings  and  the  angles  of  the  tail  are  of  different  heights, 
the  left  wing  being  higher,  and  its  slanting  movement  being  a  g.  The 
third  arrangement  of  the  slant  of  the  same  wings  is  the  converse  of  the 
second,  for  in  it  the  left  wing  is  lower  than  the  right;  and  its  move- 
ment is  at  a  o,  and  the  position  of  the  wings  is  n  m.  g  64  v. 


FLIGHT  477 

A  SCREEN  TO  PREVENT  THE  WIND  FROM  TURNING  THE 
BIRD  UPSIDE  DOWN 

I  have  seen  the  bird  turned  upside  down  by  the  wind  on  its  left 
when  it  entered  above  the  wind  with  its  left  wing. 

In  the  case  of  all  the  birds  that  fly  high  as  they  raise  their  wings  they 
remain  perforated,  as  is  shown  in  its  place.  And  as  the  wings  descend 
they  remain  united;  so  as  the  compressed  and  condensed  air  does  not 
yield  place  to  the  descent  of  the  wings  with  the  same  speed  as  the 
wing,  it  becomes  necessary  for  the  bird  to  have  the  reflex  of  such  per- 
cussion, by  which  it  rises  and  is  carried  to  a  height,  by  the  impetus 
acquired,  through  as  great  a  span  of  height  as  the  impetus  of  the  reflex 
has  of  life.  And  in  this  time  the  wings  reopen  and  become  perforated 
with  the  spaces  interposed  between  the  said  feathers,  then  the  bird 
lowers  its  wings  again  violently  as  it  closes  up  its  feathers,  and  so  ac- 
quires anew  the  impetus  that  it  had  lost.  And  in  this  way  all  the  birds 
act  which  rise  in  straight  movement  such  as  the  lark  and  the  like.  And 
chose  birds  which  do  not  possess  such  a  wide  expanse  of  feathers  such 
as  birds  of  prey,  it  is  necessary  for  them  to  raise  themselves  by  turning 
round,  that  is  in  the  form  of  a  screw  or  otherwise  in  circular  move- 
ment. 

The  butterfly  and  many  similar  insects  all  fly  with  four  wings 
having  those  behind  smaller  than  those  in  front.  Those  in  front  form 
a  partial  covering  to  those  behind,  and  all  the  insects  of  this  class  pos- 
sess the  power  to  rise  with  straight  movement,  for  as  they  raise  them- 
selves on  these  wings  they  remain  perforated  because  they  keep  the 
front  wings  much  higher  than  those  behind.  And  this  continues  almost 
to  the  end  of  that  impulse  which  urges  them  upwards,  and  then  as 
they  lower  their  wings  the  larger  become  joined  to  the  lesser,  and  so  as 
they  descend  they  again  acquire  a  fresh  impulse. 

There  are  also  other  kinds  of  flying  insects  which  fly  with  four 
wings  equal,  but  these  do  not  cover  each  other  in  their  descent  any 
more  than  in  their  rise;  and  those  of  this  kind  cannot  rise  with  straight 
movement.  g  65  r. 


478  FLIGHT 

OF  PERCUSSION— FLIGHT  OF  MAN 

Of  the  things  that  fall  in  the  air  from  the  same  height,  that  will 
produce  less  percussion  which  descends  by  the  longer  route:  it  follows 
that  that  which  descends  by  the  shorter  route  will  produce  more  per- 
cussion. 

This  first  movable  thing  formed  of  paper  slightly  curved  has  its 
first  descent  with  the  front  b  and  moves  from  a  to  c,  in  which  move- 
ment a  descends  farther  than  b;  consequently  a  at  the  end  of  the  reflex 
movement  finds  itself  at  c,  and  b  is  raised  to  d.  And  this  is  proved  by 
the  ninth  of  this  which  says: — the  thing  that  strikes  the  air  with  a 
greater  part  of  itself  has  less  power  to  penetrate  this  air.  And  by  the 
tenth: — that  thing  is  swifter  in  penetrating  the  air  which  strikes  it 
with  less  breadth.  And  by  the  eleventh: — the  heaviest  part  of  a  body 
that  moves  through  the  air  becomes  the  guide  of  the  movement  of 
this  body. 

This  may  be  proved: — let  a  b  be  the  heavy  substance,  which,  al- 
though in  itself  of  uniform  thickness  and  weight,  being  in  a  slanting 
position,  has  a  front  that  has  more  weight  than  any  other  part  of  its 
breadth  equal  to  the  front  which  can  serve  as  its  face,  and  for  this 
reason  the  front  will  become  the  guide  of  this  descent.  And  by  the 
twelfth: — that  air  offers  most  resistance  to  its  moving  thing  which  is 
most  compressed;  therefore  that  face  weighs  least  with  its  parts  which 
has  below  it  the  compressed  air.  And  by  the  thirteenth: — the  air  that 
has  the  swiftest  movement  moves  most — it  follows  that  the  man  can 
descend  as  is  shown  below. 

This  [man]  will  move  on  the  right  side  if  he  bends  the  right  arm 
and  extends  the  left  arm;  and  he  will  then  move  from  right  to  left  by 
changing  the  position  of  the  arms.  g  74  r. 

GRAVITY 

Every  slanting  movement  made  by  a  heavy  substance  through  the 
air  divides  the  gravity  of  the  movable  thing  in  two  different  aspects, 
one  of  which  is  directed  to  the  place  towards  which  it  moves  and  the 
other  to  the  cause  that  restrains  it.  c  74  v. 


FLIGHT  479 

[Of  the  wings  of  the  fly] 

The  lower  wings  are  more  slanting  than  those  above,  both  as  to 
length  and  as  to  breadth. 

The  fly  when  it  hovers  in  the  air  upon  its  wings  beats  its  wings 
with  great  speed  and  din,  raising  them  from  the  horizontal  position  up 
as  high  as  the  wing  is  long.  And  as  it  raises  them  it  brings  them  for- 
ward in  a  slanting  position  in  such  a  way  as  almost  to  strike  the  air 
edgewise;  and  as  it  lowers  them  it  strikes  the  air  and  so  would  rise 
somewhat  if  it  were  not  that  the  creature  threw  its  weight  in  the  oppo- 
site direction  by  means  of  its  slant.  As  though  the  slant  of  the  fly  when 
stationary  in  the  air  was  along  the  line  e  f,  and  the  slant  of  the  move- 
ment of  the  wings  between  the  straight  up  and  the  straight  down 
position  followed  the  lines  a  b,  c  d  which  intersect  with  the  line  of  the 
descent  e  f  between  right  angles,  in  such  movement  that  the  power  of 
the  descent  by  the  slant  e  f  is  equal  to  the  power  that  it  has  to  raise 
itself  by  the  slant  of  the  movement  of  the  wings  by  the  slant  d  b  c  a. 

And  the  back  legs  serve  it  as  a  rudder,  and  when  it  wishes  to  fly  it 
lowers  its  wings  as  much  as  possible.  g  92  r. 

The  ascent1  of  birds  or  their  rebound  near  to  any  object  will  never 
extend  as  far  as  the  descent  or  will  not  exceed  it.  h  33  v. 

The  bird  rises  to  a  height  in  a  straight  line  without  beating  its  wings 
when  the  reflex  movement  of  the  wind  strikes  it  from  underneath. 

I  have  divided  the  Treatise  on  Birds  into  four  books;  of  which  the 
first  treats  of  their  flight  by  beating  their  wings;  the  second  of  flight 
without  beating  the  wings  and  with  the  help  of  the  wind;  the  third  of 
flight  in  general,  such  as  that  of  birds,  bats,  fishes,  animals  and  insects; 
the  last  of  the  mechanism  of  this  movement.  k  3  r. 

If  one  of  the  wings  is  lowered  rapidly  and  then  folded,  the  bird  drops 
a  little  on  that  side;  and  if  it  is  lowered  rapidly  and  extended  the  bird 
drops  on  the  opposite  side;  and  if  it  is  lowered  slowly  and  extended 
the  bird  moves  in  a  circle  round  this  wing,  falling  as  it  proceeds;  and  if 
it  is  lowered  slowly  and  with  hesitation  and  folded  up  the  bird  then 
descends  in  curves  on  that  side.  k  4  r.  and  3  v. 

All  birds  driven  by  the  water  or  by  the  wind  keep  their  heads  in  the 

1  MS.  calare. 


480  FLIGHT 

direction  from  whence  the  water  or  the  wind  is  coming.  They  do  this 
in  order  to  prevent  the  wind  or  the  water  penetrating  up  from  the 
extremities  to  the  roots  of  the  feathers,  so  that  each  of  the  feathers  may 
be  pressed  against  one  another,  and  thus  they  may  remain  drier  and 
warmer.  k  3  v. 

When  the  bird  lowers  one  of  its  wings  necessity  constrains  it  in- 
stantly to  extend  it,  for  if  it  did  not  do  so  it  would  turn  right  over. 
The  bird  when  it  wishes  to  turn  does  not  beat  its  wings  with  equal 
movement,  but  moves  the  one  which  makes  the  convex  of  the  circle  it 
describes  more  than  that  which  makes  the  concave  of  the  circle. 

K  4  V. 

If  the  rudder  or  tail  of  the  bird  is  beneath  the  wind  the  bird  will  be 
pulled  down  by  the  wind  from  its  middle  backwards,  and  turned  with 
its  front  towards  the  wind. 

And  if  the  bird  is  struck  on  the  slant  of  its  tail  above  the  wind  it  will 
be  pulled  down  in  front  and  turn  towards  the  wind.  k  5  r. 

The  bird  often  beats  twice  with  one  wing  and  once  with  the  other 
and  it  does  this  when  it  has  got  too  far  over  to  that  side. 

It  also  does  the  same  when  it  wishes  to  turn  on  one  side;  it  takes  two 
strokes  with  one  wing  backwards,  keeping  the  opposite  wing  almost 
stationary  pointing  towards  the  spot  to  which  it  ought  to  turn. 

k  5  v. 

The  helms  of  the  wings  are  used  when  the  bird  is  struck  from  behind 
by  the  wind  and  rests  slantwise  upon  the  air  that  supports  it:  the  bird 
is  then  struck  by  the  wind  in  the  front  of  these  helms  and  so  is  driven 
upwards,  its  reflex  movement  being  increased  by  the  movement  of  the 
wind.  k  6  r. 

If  the  extent  of  the  slant  of  the  tail  from  the  centre  of  the  bird  back- 
wards is  more  than  that  of  the  wing  from  the  centre  of  the  bird  for- 
wards the  bird  will  turn  to  face  the  wind.  But  if  the  slanting  part  of 
the  wing  is  greater  in  extent  than  that  of  the  tail  then  the  tail  will  turn 
towards  the  approach  of  the  wind.  k  6  v. 

The  bird  beats  its  wings  repeatedly  on  one  side  only  when  it  wishes 
to  turn  round  while  one  wing  is  held  stationary;  and  this  it  does  by 


FLIGHT  481 

taking  a  stroke  with  the  wing  in  the  direction  of  the  tail,  like  a  man 
cowing  in  a  boat  with  two  oars,  who  takes  many  strokes  on  that  side 
from  which  he  wishes  to  escape,  and  keeps  the  other  oar  fixed. 

k  7  r. 

Of  the  flexion  of  the  tip  of  the  wing  even  when  the  wing  does  not 
beat. 

The  helms  which  are  on  the  shoulders  of  the  wings  are  necessary 
when  the  bird  in  its  flight  without  beating  its  wings  wishes  to  maintain 
itself  in  part  of  a  tract  of  air,  upon  which  it  is  either  slipping  down  or 
rising,  and  when  it  wishes  to  bend  either  upwards  or  downwards  or  to 
right  or  left.  It  then  uses  these  helms  in  this  manner: — if  the  bird 
wishes  to  rise  it  spreads  the  helm  in  the  opposite  direction  to  the  way 
the  wind  strikes  it;  and  if  to  descend  it  spreads  the  top  part  of  the 
helm  slanting  to  the  course  of  the  wind.  If  it  turns  to  the  right  it 
spreads  the  right  helm  to  the  wind,  and  if  it  turns  to  the  left  it  spreads 
the  left  helm  to  the  wind.  k  7  v. 

The  helm  of  the  wing  is  used  by  the  bird  when  in  flying  it  supports 
itself  upon  its  wings  raised  so  that  by  their  vibration  they  prevent  it 
from  descending;  and  in  addition  to  this  these  helms  or  fingers  show 
themselves  fronting  the  air  down  which  the  slant  of  the  bird  is  gliding, 
and  by  thus  striking  upon  it  with  these  helms  it  resists  it  as  it  glides. 

That  bird  descends  most  rapidly  which  has  the  least  distance  be- 
tween the  extremities  of  the  tips  of  its  wings.  k  8  r. 

The  birds  which  seek  to  penetrate  within  the  approaching  wind  are 
in  the  habit  of  fluttering  to  the  right  and  to  the  left,  like  sailors  tacking 
against  the  direction  of  the  winds;  and  this  they  do  in  order  not  to 
make  a  long  descent,  for  if  the  bird  did  not  guard  against  descending 
for  any  great  distance,  it  would  be  driven  right  against  the  current  of 
the  wind;  and,  entering  under  the  wind  slanting  lengthwise,  it  will 
present  so  much  of  its  weight  by  this  line  as  to  subdue  the  resistance  of 
the  wind.  k  8  v. 

The  'hands'  of  the  bird  show  themselves  in  front,  close  to  the  spot 
where  it  descends  by  a  straight  slant  in  order  to  consume  the  impetus 
it  has  acquired. 


482  FLIGHT 

By  beating  its  wings  in  order  to  support  itself  at  a  height  and  to 
advance  from  the  'hand'  behind,  it  supports  itself  at  the  height  and  the 
'hand'  causes  it  to  make  progress.  k  9  r. 

When  the  bird  is  carried  along  by  the  wind  and  wishes  to  turn 
quickly  towards  it,  it  will  then  enter  beneath  the  wind  with  the  wing 
turned  towards  it;  and  then  with  the  feathers  of  the  tail  turned  towards 
the  wind,  it  will  enter  upon  it,  and  so  by  the  help  of  the  wind  striking 
upon  its  tail  it  turns  much  more  rapidly.  k  9  v. 

The  wing  bends  so  much  the  more  in  proportion  as  the  bird  is 
swifter  in  the  same  space  of  time. 

What  difference  there  is  between  the  tips  of  the  wings  of  birds  which 
bend  and  those  which  do  not,  and  whether  to  bend  up  and  down  thus 
is  necessary  for  the  flight  of  these  birds  or  no,  since  one  sees  that  how- 
ever slightly  these  tips  are  cut  the  bird's  power  of  flight  is  almost 
stopped.  k  10  r. 

When  the  bird  rises  up  by  the  assistance  of  the  wind  without  beating 
its  wings,  it  spreads  out  and  raises  its  wings  so  that  they  form  an  arch 
with  the  concave  side  towards  the  sky,  and  it  receives  the  wind  under 
its  wings  continually,  in  its  movement  to  and  fro,  and  this  would  cause 
it  to  turn  right  over  if  it  were  not  that  the  point  of  its  tail  is  turned  to 
the  wind  as  it  enters  beneath  the  wind;  and  this  afterwards  by  its 
power  of  resistance  acts  to  prevent  the  said  movement  of  turning  over, 
because  the  wings  are  restrained  by  the  tail  in  such  a  way  that  their 
various  parts  are  of  equal  power,  and  so  the  tail  becomes  partly  lowered 
and  the  bird  is  raised  forward  slightly.  k  10  v. 

Always  the  wind  that  strikes  the  tail  is  farther  removed  from  the 
centre  and  more  powerful  than  that  of  the  wing. 

What  has  been  set  forth  before  is  here  proved.  I  say  that  if  the  wing 
be  in  such  a  position  in  relation  to  the  tail  that  the  amount  of  the  wind 
a  b  which  strikes  the  wing  m  o  is  equal  to  the  amount  of  the  wind  b  c 
which  strikes  the  tail  above  at  o  n,  the  bird  will  not  turn,  but  will  be 
carried  in  the  line  of  the  course  of  the  wind.  But  if  the  wind  that  strikes 
the  tail  above  is  more  powerful  than  the  wind  that  strikes  beneath  the 
wing,  then  the  tail  will  move  away  and  will  be  dominated  by  the  power 
of  the  wind,  and  the  wing  will  turn  to  the  wind  which  will  be  more 


FLIGHT  4S> 

powerful  than  it  was  before,  because  the  movement  that  the  wing 
makes  against  the  wind  increases  in  speed  and  power,  and  so  the  wind 
entering  beneath  it  forms  a  wedge  there  and  raises  and  turns  it. 

k  n  r. 

When  the  bird  wishes  to  ascend  it  drives  the  centre  of  its  gravity 
behind  the  centre  of  its  wings,  and  it  does  this  in  order  to  be  in  a  slant- 
ing position.  It  is  of  the  nature  of  an  equable  wind  to  straighten  all  the 
uneven  parts  of  the  bird,  placing  it  with  its  extremities  equidistant  from 
the  centre  of  its  bulk,  this  being  understood  of  such  as  support  them- 
selves without  beating  their  wings  in  the  air  by  the  help  of  the  wind; 
and  consequently  it  makes  first  a  circling  movement  and  then  a  straight 
movement.  k  n  v. 

When  the  bird  wishes  to  avoid  being  turned  over  by  the  wind  it  has 
two  expedients,  one  of  which  is  to  move  the  wing  that  was  above  the 
wind  and  place  it  suddenly  below  the  wind,  that  is  to  say  the  one  that 
was  turned  to  the  wind;  the  other  is  to  lower  the  opposite  wing  so  that 
the  wind  that  strikes  it  on  the  inside  is  more  powerful  than  on  the 
wing  that  faces  the  wind.  k  12  r. 

The  bird  in  its  flight  without  the  help  of  the  wind  drops  half  the 
wing  downwards,  and  thrusts  the  other  half  towards  the  tip  back- 
wards; and  the  part  which  is  moved  down  prevents  the  descent  of  the 
bird,  and  that  which  goes  backward  drives  the  bird  forward. 

When  the  bird  raises  its  wings  it  brings  their  extremities  near  to- 
gether; and  while  lowering  them  it  spreads  them  farther  apart  during 
the  first  part  of  the  movement,  but  after  this  middle  stage  as  they 
continue  to  descend  it  brings  them  together  again.  k  12  v. 

The  point  of  the  wing  of  the  bird  serves  to  guide  it  through  the  air 
as  the  point  of  the  oar  does  through  the  water  or  the  arm  or  hand  of 
the  swimmer  beneath  the  water.  But  here  arises  a  doubt  as  to  whether, 
if  for  instance  the  bird  be  travelling  along  the  line  /  a  and  the  wing  or 
rather  the  point  move  backward  moving  from  a  to  /,  it  makes  its  path 
by  a  b  /,  driving  the  bird  forward,  and  returns  towards  a  by  the  path 
above  f  c  a,  or  whether  it  really  acts  as  the  hand  of  the  swimmer  does 
under  the  water  which  forces  itself  back  by  the  line  above  a  c  f  and 
returns  by  /  b  a.  k  13  r. 


484  FLIGHT 

When  the  bird  is  borne  along  by  the  help  of  the  north  wind,  and 
moves  with  it  to  the  south,  it  keeps  one  wing  fixed  to  the  north-east,  a 
little  above  the  wind,  and  lowers  the  wing  that  is  to  the  south-west  and 
makes  it  serve  as  a  cover  to  the  wind  by  receiving  there  beneath  it  the 
percussion  of  the  wind  slantwise.  It  seldom  beats  this  wing  but  it  is 
entirely  by  means  of  it  that  it  maintains  its  equilibrium,  whether  the 
wind  be  greater  or  less. 

When  the  bird  ascends  by  reflex  movement  against  the  wind,  if  it 
did  not  turn  round  on  its  lower  wing  it  would  by  this  reflex  movement 
turn  back  with  its  breast  to  the  wind,  and  this  wind  would  over- 
throw it. 

And  ascending  by  reflex  movement  with  its  spine  to  the  wind  it 
would  turn  back  with  its  spine  below  the  wind.  k  13  v. 

The  thrushes  and  the  other  birds  fly  readily  against  the  wind. 

When  the  bird  wishes  to  let  itself  fall  on  one  of  its  sides  it  throws 
its  wing  down  rapidly  on  the  side  on  which  it  wishes  to  descend,  and 
the  impetus  of  this  movement  causes  the  bird  to  drop  on  this  side. 

When  the  north  wind  blows  and  the  bird  is  carried  by  the  wind  and 
wishes  to  return  facing  the  wind,  it  drives  the  wing  downwards  and 
turns  and  enters  with  its  spine  beneath  the  wind.  k  14  r. 

A  bird  beats  its  wings  frequently  as  it  settles  when  it  has  descended 
from  a  height,  in  order  to  break  the  impetus  of  the  descent,  to  settle 
itself  on  the  ground  and  to  diminish  the  force  of  the  impact. 

k  58  [9]  r. 

When  birds  ascend  by  wheeling  round  with  the  wind  they  keep  their 
wings  very  high  so  that  the  wedge  of  the  wind  and  of  the  impetus  may 
raise  them. 

When  they  move  in  a  downward  direction  they  lower  their  wings 
for  two  reasons;  the  first  is  because  less  air  sustains  them,  the  other 
because  the  wind  serves  as  a  wedge  above  them  and  drives  them  down 
and  continually  lowers  them.  k  58  [9]  v. 

Many  are  the  times  when  the  bird  beats  the  corners  of  its  tail  in  order 
to  steer  itself,  and  in  this  action  the  wings  are  used  sometimes  very 
little,  sometimes  not  at  all.  k  59  [10]  r. 


FLIGHT  485 

When  the  kite  rises  or  sinks  without  beating  its  wings,  it  holds  them 
slanting,  and  keeps  the  tail  slanting  in  the  same  way  but  not  to  the 
same  extent,  for  if  this  were  so  the  bird  would  fall  to  the  ground  by 
the  line  of  the  slant  of  the  wings  and  of  the  tail;  but  as  this  tail  is  away 
from  the  centre  of  the  bird's  length  it  meets  with  somewhat  more  re- 
sistance than  the  wings,  and  this  in  consequence  checks  its  movement, 
and  so  the  tail  has  less  movement  than  the  wings.  Necessity  causes  the 
bird  to  move  with  a  circular  motion,  and  as  the  tail  is  less  slanting  so 
in  proportion  the  circles  are  less  in  diameter,  and  so  also  conversely. 

k  59   [10]   v.  and  60   [11]   r. 

When  the  bird  flies  along  a  level  line  it  seems  that  the  nearer  it 
approaches  the  eye  the  more  it  rises. 
[Diagram] 

Let  g  h  be  the  level  line  and  let  the  bird  be  moving  along  g  c  s,  and 
let  n  be  the  eye.  I  say  that  as  the  images  of  the  bird  rise  in  every  stage 
of  its  movement  in  every  stage  of  height  in  the  pupil  it  seems  to  the 
eye  that  this  bird  is  rising.  k  121  [41]  v. 

And  if  the  bird  flies  along  a  level  line  separating  itself  from  the  eye 
it  will  seem  to  be  descending  stage  by  stage  with  the  stages  of  its 
movement.  k  121  [41]  r. 

The  slanting  movement  made  by  the  descent  of  birds  commences 
with  the  wings  straight  and  low.  Gradually  they  stretch  out  their  wings 
in  order  to  consume  the  access  of  impetus  which  heavy  bodies  acquire 
at  each  stage  of  their  descent.  And  when  such  a  movement  is  retarded 
by  the  too  great  expansion  of  wings  then  this  bird  again  contracts  its 
wings  and  so  again  the  descent  commences  to  become  swift.

Route  made  through  the  air  by  flying  things  which  descend,  with 
their  expansion  and  contraction  of  wings.  l  54  r. 

[Slanting  flight  of  birds] 

When  the  bird  descends  by  any  slant  whatever  it  brings  the  humerus 
of  the  wings  near  to  its  shoulders  and  draws  together  the  points  of  the 
wings  towards  the  tail,  and  this  tail  is  also  drawn  together  into  itself 
and  by  so  doing  it  meets  with  a  less  volume  of  air  to  resist  its  descent. 

But  when  this  bird  wishes  to  turn  to  the  right  or  to  the  left  it  will 


486  FLIGHT 

extend  its  right  or  left  wing,  that  is  to  say  the  wing  that  is  on  the  side 
on  which  it  wishes  to  turn.  This  extended  wing  finds  a  greater  volume 
of  air  and  in  consequence  comes  to  meet  with  a  greater  resistance,  with 
result  that  it  slackens  its  pace  more  than  the  opposite  wing  does  which 
is  more  contracted,  and  as  the  one  wing  moves  more  than  the  other  the 
bird  transforms  its  straight  movement  into  a  circling  movement;  but 
if  the  wing  which  is  more  contracted  towards  the  bird's  body  than  the 
other  cannot  expand  with  that  ease  which  the  bird  requires,  then  it 
spreads  out  its  tail  and  twists  it  thus  open  towards  the  side  where  this 
wing  is  contracted.  This  bird  will  then  fly  in  a  straight  movement  and 
so  as  you  see  it  will  leave  the  circular  movement. 

There  are  two  helms  on  the  humerus  of  the  wings  of  each  bird,  and 
these  without  making  any  change  of  wings  have  power  to  cause  the 
birds  various  movements  between  ascending  and  descending;  it  is  only 
in  the  transversal  movements  that  the  helm  of  the  tail  takes  part. 

l  54  v.  and  55  r. 

[The  flight  of  birds  with  the  wind] 

The  movement  of  things  that  fly  is  much  swifter  than  that  of  the 
wind.  For  if  it  were  not  so  no  bird  would  move  against  the  wind.  But 
its  movement  against  the  wind  is  as  much  less  than  its  natural  course 
within  the  still  air  as  the  degrees  of  movement  of  the  wind  are  less 
than  that  of  the  bird. 

Let  us  say  the  bird  moves  in  the  still  air  at  a  speed  of  six  degrees  and 
the  wind  of  itself  moves  at  a  speed  of  two  degrees,  then  this  wind 
following  its  natural  course  takes  away  two  degrees  of  speed  from  this 
bird  and  consequently  of  the  six  degrees  there  remain  four. 

But  if  such  bird  were  to  fly  at  six  degrees  of  speed  together  with  the 
course  of  the  wind  which  imparts  to  it  its  two  degrees,  this  bird  would 
be  flying  at  eight  degrees  of  speed.  Here  however  one  should  observe 
how  the  wing  is  supported  in  its  percussion  in  the  motionless  air,  the 
retreating  air  or  the  air  that  follows  after  it,  and  guide  one's  self  ac- 
cording to  these  rules.  l  55  v. 

[Flight  of  birds — the  lar1(\ 

When  the  bird  finds  itself  upside  down,  as  is  seen  at  a,  the  tips  of 
the  wings  are  driven  towards  the  ground  as  is  shown  at  b;  and  then 


FLIGHT  487 

this  flying  thing  will  straighten  itself  in  its  first  position,  but  it  bends 
the  tail  spread  out  towards  its  spine. 

And  if  it  falls  edgewise  it  will  raise  its  wings  towards  its  spine  and 
then  straighten  itself. 

There  are  many  varieties  of  birds  which  can  only  raise  themselves 
spirally,  that  is  by  revolving  movements;  the  lark  is  an  exception  be- 
cause as  it  raises  its  wings  it  proceeds  to  transpierce  them  with  air  in 
such  a  way  that  they  oflfer  no  resistance  being  almost  entirely  trans- 
pierced. 

When  the  bird  wishes  to  go  down  it  throws  its  wings  backward  in 
such  a  way  that  the  centre  of  their  gravity  comes  away  from  the  middle 
of  the  resistance  of  the  wings  and  so  it  comes  to  fall  forward. 

l  56  r. 

The  flight  of  many  birds  is  swifter  than  is  the  wind  which  drives 
them.  And  this  arises  from  driving  the  wings  in  the  wind  which  car- 
ries this  bird.  If  it  were  not  so  the  birds  that  rest  upon  the  wind  would 
not  be  able  to  fly  against  the  wind. 

The  bird  in  raising  its  wings  sends  them  partly  forward  and  partly 
upward,  and  the  whole  wing  comes  to  go  edgewise,  and  each  feather 
of  itself,  and  in  addition  to  this  it  remains  transpierced;  and  as  it 
proceeds  downward  it  thrusts  it  back  in  face  of  the  air  or  of  the  wind 
and  the  transpiercing  of  the  feathers  and  of  the  whole  wing  become 
united.  l  56  v.

with  ribs  by  the  stems  of  the  reeds.  l  57  r. 

[Wings  of  birds] 

The  bird  which  is  swifter  in  lowering  than  in  raising  its  wings  is 
that  which  raises  itself  more  by  pressing  the  underpart  of  the  wings 
towards  the  centre  of  the  earth. 

But  if  they  press  this  underpart  of  the  wings  towards  the  horizon 
they  will  make  equal  movements. 


488  FLIGHT

You  will  note  if  the  feathers  of  c  a  are  placed  above  in  the  manner 
and  order  of  a  b. 

A  b  n  m  is  the  position  of  the  shutters  (sportelli).  l  58  r. 

The  opening  and  lowering  of  the  tail  and  the  spreading  out  of  the 
wings  at  the  same  time  to  their  full  extent,  arrests  the  swift  movement 
of  birds. 

When  birds  in  descending  are  near  to  the  ground,  and  the  head  is 
below  the  tail,  they  then  lower  the  tail,  which  is  spread  wide  open,  and 
take  short  strokes  with  the  wings;  and  consequently  the  head  becomes 
higher  than  the  tail,  and  the  speed  is  checked  to  such  an  extent  that 
the  bird  alights  on  the  ground  without  any  shock. 

In  all  the  changes  which  birds  make  in  their  lines  of  movement  they 
spread  out  their  tails. 

There  are  many  birds  which  move  their  wings  as  swiftly  when  they 
raise  them  as  when  they  let  them  fall:  such  as  magpies  and  birds  like 
these.  l  58  v. 

There  are  some  birds  which  are  in  the  habit  of  moving  their  wings 
more  swiftly  when  they  lower  them  than  when  they  raise  them,  and 
this  is  seen  to  be  the  case  with  doves  and  such  like  birds. 

There  are  others  which  lower  their  wings  more  slowly  than  they 
raise  them,  and  this  is  seen  with  rooks  and  other  birds  like  these. 

The  birds  which  fly  swiftly,  keeping  at  the  same  distance  above  the 
ground,  are  in  the  habit  of  beating  their  wings  downwards  and  behind 
them,  downwards  to  the  extent  necessary  to  prevent  the  bird  from 
descending,  and  behind  when  they  wish  to  advance  with  greater  speed. 

The  speed  of  birds  is  checked  by  the  opening  and  spreading  out  of 
the  tail.  l  59  v. 

When  the  slant  of  the  flying  thing  is  struck  by  the  wind  in  its  lower 
part  this  flying  thing  will  rise  upwards. 

But  when  this  slant  is  struck  in  its  upper  part  this  flying  thing  will 
be  constrained  to  descend  from  its  height. 

But  if  the  wind  which  strikes  the  said  birds  in  the  part  below  were 
to  overturn  them  the  flying  thing  will  then  contract  its  wings  some- 
what, with  result  that  it  will  descend  by  its  heaviest  part.  l  60  r. 


FLIGHT  489 

When  the  kite  in  descending  turns  itself  right  over  and  pierces  the 
air  head  downwards,  it  is  forced  to  bend  the  tail  as  far  as  it  can  in  the 
opposite  direction  to  that  which  it  desires  to  follow;  and  then  again 
bending  the  tail  swiftly,  according  to  the  direction  in  which  it  wishes 
to  turn,  the  change  in  the  bird's  course  corresponds  to  the  turn  of  the 
tail,  like  the  rudder  of  a  ship  which  when  turned  turns  the  ship,  but 
in  the  opposite  direction. 

When  the  wind  is  about  to  throw  the  bird  backward  the  bird  draws 
together  the  shoulders  of  its  wings,  so  that  its  weight  is  massed  more 
to  the  front  than  it  was  at  first,  and  consequently  the  part  that  is 
heaviest  is  first  in  its  descent,  while  in  addition  the  tail  is  spread  out 
and  bent  down.  l  62  r. 

[Tail  and  wings  of  birds] 

When  one  of  the  sides  of  the  tail  of  the  flying  body  is  lowered  with 
a  swift  movement,  then  the  air  where  it  strikes  is  more  compressed  and 
as  a  consequence  offers  more  resistance,  whence  of  necessity  the  bird 
bends  with  its  opposite  side,  and  so  the  movement  of  this  bird  is  curved 
circling  round  the  part  of  the  tail  which  is  lower. 

But  when  it  is  sometimes  the  one  and  sometimes  the  other  point  of 
the  tail  which  impels  it  to  lower  itself  sometimes  to  the  right  and  some- 
times to  the  left,  it  does  not  make  a  circling  movement  but  it  is  merely 
a  way  of  striking  the  air  as  wings  would  do.  When  this  bird  feels  itself 
dropping  on  one  of  the  sides  this  tail  beats  the  air  on  the  opposite  side 
and  in  this  way  it  resists  this  tendency.  l  62  v. 


[A  goose  swimming  and  flight] 

OF  MOVEMENT 

Swimming  illustrates  the  method  of  flying  and  shows  that  the 
weight  which  is  largest  finds  most  resistance  in  the  air.  Observe  a 
goose's  foot:  if  it  was  always  open  or  closed  in  the  same  manner  the 
creature  would  not  be  able  to  make  any  kind  of  movement.  It  is  true 
that  the  curve  of  the  foot  outwards  would  have  more  perception  of  the 
water  in  going  forward  than  the  foot  would  have  as  it  was  drawn 
back;  this  shows  that  with  the  same  weight  the  wider  it  is  the  slower 
its  movement  becomes. 


490  FLIGHT 

Observe  the  goose  moving  through  the  water,  how  as  it  moves  its 
foot  forward  it  closes  it  and  covers  but  little  water  and  consequently 
acquires  speed,  and  as  it  draws  it  back  it  spreads  it  out  and  so  makes 
itself  slower,  and  then  the  part  that  has  contact  with  the  air  becomes 
swifter.  m  83  r. 

When  one  wing  bends  with  the  same  speed  as  the  other  but  with  a 
longer  movement  it  will  cause  the  straight  movement  to  bend  to  a 
curve.  b.m.  43  r. 

CONCERNING  THINGS  THAT  CAN  FLY

This  raises  itself  in  circles  by  means  of  the  wind.  This  creature  is 
always  struck  below  by  the  wind  by  a  slanting  line;  and  when  this 
wind  strikes  it  in  front  it  bends  its  wings  with  its  shoulders  towards 
the  sky;  and  when  the  wind  catches  it  in  the  tail  it  bends  its  shoulders 
towards  the  ground.  And  so  always  this  bird  takes  the  wind  at  its 
centre  of  gravity  in  front  or  behind  or  at  the  side.  b.m.  134  r. 

The  tail  adds  or  takes  away  the  weight  from  the  wings  of  the  bird.

The  heavy  substance  finds  least  resistance  by  the  line  in  which  it 
weighs  most.  b.m.  146  r. 

That  bird  will  raise  itself  in  flight  more  readily  which  gets  the 
impetus  of  its  movement  by  dropping  somewhat  at  the  beginning  of  its 
flight. 

When  a  bird  flies  against  the  wind  it  is  necessary  that  the  progress 
which  it  makes  against  the  wind  should  be  made  in  a  slanting  line 
towards  the  earth,  entering  underneath  the  wind.  And  this  because  its 
weight  is  more  powerful  than  that  of  the  amount  of  wind  which 
strikes  it  at  unequal  angles,  and  would  wish  to  press  it  down  towards 
the  ground  if  it  were  not  that  the  air  which  is  in  front  in  the  line  of  its 
movement  is  far  less  in  amount  than  the  air  which  happens  to  be  below 
it  and  which  touches  it.  This  movement  alone  suffices  to  subdue  that 


FLIGHT  491 

air  which  offers  less  resistance,  and  that  will  offer  less  resistance  which 
is  less  in  quantity. 

Therefore  from  what  has  been  stated  we  are  certain  that  the  bird  will 
move  itself  against  that  part  of  the  air  which  offers  less  resistance  and 
which  meets  the  helms  of  the  wings,  rather  than  against  that  which 
meets  it  from  below  along  the  whole  extent  of  these  wings. 

Rectilinear  movement 

But  when  this  bird  wishes  to  rise  to  a  height  it  will  enter  above  the 
wind,  and  it  will  retain  enough  of  the  impetus  it  has  acquired  in  the 
descent  we  have  spoken  of,  so  that  by  means  of  the  speed  thus  gained 
it  will  lower  its  tail  and  likewise  the  elbows  of  its  wings  and  will  raise 
up  its  helms.  It  will  then  be  above  the  wind,  and  as  this  impetus  is 
constrained  neither  to  cease  nor  to  be  consumed  its  nature  forthwith 
compels  it  to  follow  along  the  line  where  the  least  amount  of  air  im- 
pedes its  movement,  which  will  be  in  that  line  in  which  the  wings 
show  themselves  edgewise  to  the  air  where  they  strike,  that  is  along  the 
line  where  the  air  as  it  is  met  is  always  divided  by  the  helms  which  are 
in  the  thickness  of  the  wings  and  never  along  the  line  of  their  width. 

After  having  done  this  then  the  bird  rises  up  without  beating  its 
wings,  for  the  wind  which  passes  underneath  it  raises  it  up  as  a  wedge 
raises  a  weight,  and  for  this  reason  would  cause  it  to  turn  backwards, 
if  it  were  not  that  in  this  act  of  rising  it  is  continually  becoming  slower 
and  consuming  the  impetus  already  acquired.  And  after  this  impulse 
has  been  consumed  the  bird  would  be  overturned  by  the  wind  which 
has  carried  it  up  to  a  height  if  it  did  not  immediately  lower  the  helms 
of  the  shoulders  of  the  wings,  enter  underneath  the  wind  and  lower  its 
tail.  Then  the  movement  which  has  just  ended  commences  anew,  and 
as  it  drops  it  acquires  again  the  impetus  which  it  has  lost,  with  which  it 
again  rises  up  to  a  height  with  reflex  movement  until  it  again  loses  the 
impetus  that  it  has  acquired. 

If  however  such  movement  were  circular  then  the  bird  would  follow 
other  rules  which  will  subsequently  be  defined  in  due  order.

FLIGHT 


OF  THE  BIRD  THAT  MOVES  WITHOUT  WIND  OR  BEATING 

OF  WINGS 

The  movement  of  a  bird  without  beating  of  wings  or  help  of  wind  is 
along  a  line  that  slants  steeply  downwards  and  then  rises  with  a  reflex 
movement.  By  this  reflex  movement  it  raises  itself  seven  eighths  of  the 
height  of  its  falling  movement  and  it  goes  on  doing  this  little  by  little 
until  it  reaches  the  ground. 

OF  THE  MOVEMENT  AGAINST  THE  WIND  WITHOUT 
BEATING  OF  WINGS  WHICH  RAISES  THE  BIRD 

Here  the  falling  movement  is  below  the  wind  and  the  reflex  move- 
ment will  be  above  the  wind.  b.m.  277  r.

The  reflex  movement  made  by  the  bird  against  the  course  of  the 
wind  becomes  considerably  greater  than  its  falling  movement;  and  it 
is  the  same  with  the  succeeding  reflex  movement  because  it  is  driven  by 
jjie  same  course  of  the  wind.  Quaderni  11,  16  r.

7  find  that  if  this  instrument  made  with  a  screw 
be  well  made — that  is  to  say,  made  of  linen  of 
which  the  pores  are  stopped  up  with  starch — and 
be  turned  swiftly,  the  said  screw  will  make  its 
spiral  in  the  air  and  it  will  rise  high! 

The  man  in  the  bird  rests  on  an  axis  a  little  higher  than  his  centre 
of  gravity.  c.a.  129  v.  a 

A  bird  is  an  instrument  working  according  to  mathematical  law, 
which  instrument  it  is  within  the  capacity  of  man  to  reproduce  with  all 
its  movements,  but  not  with  a  corresponding  degree  of  strength, 
though  it  is  deficient  only  in  the  power  of  maintaining  equilibrium. 
We  may  therefore  say  that  such  an  instrument  constructed  by  man  is 
lacking  in  nothing  except  the  life  of  the  bird,  and  this  life  must  needs 
be  supplied  from  that  of  man. 

The  life  which  resides  in  the  bird's  members  will  without  doubt 
better  conform  to  their  needs  than  will  that  of  man  which  is  sepa- 
rated from  them,  and  especially  in  the  almost  imperceptible  move- 
ments which  preserve  equilibrium.  But  since  we  see  that  the  bird  is 
equipped  for  many  obvious  varieties  of  movements,  we  are  able  from 
this  experience  to  declare  that  the  most  rudimentary  of  these  move- 
ments will  be  capable  of  being  comprehended  by  man's  understanding; 
and  that  he  will  to  a  great  extent  be  able  to  provide  against  the  destruc- 
tion of  that  instrument  of  which  he  has  himself  become  the  living 
principle  and  the  propeller.  c.a.  161  r.  a 

[Diagrams  of  mechanism  of  flying  machine] 

I  conclude  that  the  upright  position  is  more  useful  than  face  down- 
wards, because  the  instrument  cannot  get  overturned,  and  on  the  other 
hand  the  habit  of  long  custom  requires  this.

And  the  raising  and  lowering  movement  will  proceed  from  the 
lowering  and  raising  of  the  two  legs,  and  this  is  of  great  strength  and 
the  hands  remain  free;  whereas  if  it  were  face  downwards  it  would  be 
very  difficult  for  the  legs  to  maintain  themselves  in  the  fastenings  of 
the  thighs. 

And  in  resting  the  first  impact  comes  upon  the  feet,  and  in  rising 
they  touch  at  r  S  t;  and  after  these  have  been  raised  they  support  the 
machine,  and  the  feet  moving  up  and  down  lift  these  feet  from  the 
ground.

pieces  of  cane,  and  of  any  length  you  choose  since  you  make  it  in

joints  of  each  spring,  uniform  in  thickness,  number  and  length,  so  that 
they  may  all  bend  at  the  same  time  and  not  first  one  and  then  the 
other;  and  each  spring  should  of  itself  have  many  of  these  bands  of 
iron,  of  which  it  is  made  up.  But  if  you  prefer  not  to  use  bands  of  iron 
take  strips  of  cow's  horn  to  make  these  springs.  c.a.  308  v.  a

It  requires  less  effort  to  raise  the  wing  than  to  lower  it,  for  as  it  is

There  is  as  much  pressure  exerted  by  a  substance  against  the  air  as 
by  the  air  against  the  substance. 

Observe  how  the  beating  of  its  wings  against  the  air  suffices  to  bear 
up  the  weight  of  the  eagle  in  the  highly  rarefied  air  which  borders  on 
the  fiery  element!  Observe  also  how  the  air  moving  over  the  sea,  beaten 
back  by  the  bellying  sails,  causes  the  heavily  laden  ship  to  glide 
onwards ! 

1  The  words  (soatta)  'thong'  and  (corame)  'leather'  seem  to  point  to  the  probability 
that  these  two  sentences  refer  to  the  construction  and  trial  of  the  same  instrument, 
probably  a  flying  machine. 

2  On  the  same  page  of  the  manuscript  Leonardo  has  drawn  a  rough  map  of  Europe 
with  names  of  provinces  inserted.  Below  this  the  Iberian  peninsula  is  repeated  with 
lists  of  provinces  arranged  under  the  three  heads: — Spain,  France  and  Germany.  It  is 
not  perhaps  entirely  fantastic  to  suppose  that  these  maps  and  lists  of  provinces,  occurring 
on  the  same  sheet  as  the  foregoing  memoranda  of  the  construction  of  an  instrument  for 
flight,  may  have  been  connected  in  his  mind  with  possibilities  of  travel  that  the  invention 
of  flying  would  open  up  and  that  the  sketches  were  in  intention  aviators'  maps.  The 
reference  to  the  roof  at  the  side  of  the  tower  as  being  out  of  sight  of  the  men  working 
upon  the  cupola  shows  that  the  model  was  being  made  in  a  house  not  far  from  the 
Cathedral.

So  that  by  adducing  and  expounding  the  reasons  of  these  things  you 
may  be  able  to  realise  that  man  when  he  has  great  wings  attached  to 
him,  by  exerting  his  strength  against  the  resistance  of  the  air  and  con- 
quering it,  is  enabled  to  subdue  it  and  to  raise  himself  upon  it. 

[Sketch — man  with  parachute'] 

If  a  man  have  a  tent  made  of  linen  of  which  the  apertures  have  all 
been  stopped  up,  and  it  be  twelve  braccia  across  and  twelve  in  depth, 
he  will  be  able  to  throw  himself  down  from  any  great  height  without 
sustaining  any  injury. 

[  With  drawing  of  pair  of  balances  in  one  of  which  the  figure  of  a  man

And  if  you  wish  to  ascertain  what  weight  will  support  this  wing 
place  yourself  upon  one  side  of  a  pair  of  balances  and  on  the  other 
place  a  corresponding  weight  so  that  the  two  scales  are  level  in  the  air; 
then  if  you  fasten  yourself  to  the  lever  where  the  wing  is  and  cut  the 
rope  which  keeps  it  up  you  will  see  it  suddenly  fall;  and  if  it  required 
two  units  of  time  to  fall  of  itself  you  will  cause  it  to  fall  in  one  by 
taking  hold  of  the  lever  with  your  hands;  and  you  lend  so  much 
weight  to  the  opposite  arm  of  the  balance  that  the  two  become  equal 
in  respect  of  that  force;  and  whatever  is  the  weight  of  the  other  balance 
so  much  will  support  the  wing  as  it  flies;  and  so  much  the  more  as  it 
presses  the  air  more  vigorously.  c.a.  381  v.  a

Device  which  causes  the  wing  as  it  rises  to  be  all  pierced  through

separates  from  a  and  d  from  c  and  so  the  air  gives  place  to  the  rising 
of  the  wing,  and  as  it  falls  b  returns  to  a  and  similarly  c  to  d;  and  the

and  the  man  who  controls  the  machine  has  his  feet  at  /  d;  the  foot  / 
lowers  the  wings,  and  the  foot  d  raises  them. 

The  pivot  M  should  have  its  centre  of  gravity  out  of  the  perpendicu- 
lar so  that  the  wings  as  they  fall  down  also  fall  towards  the  man's  feet; 
for  it  is  this  that  causes  the  bird  to  move  forward. 

This  machine  should  be  tried  over  a  lake,  and  you  should  carry  a 
long  wineskin  as  a  girdle  so  that  in  case  you  fall  you  will  not  be 
drowned. 

It  is  also  necessary  that  the  action  of  lowering  the  wings  should  be 
done  by  the  force  of  the  two  feet  at  the  same  time,  so  that  you  can 
regulate  the  movement  and  preserve  your  equilibrium  by  lowering  one 
wing  more  rapidly  than  the  other  according  to  need,  as  you  may  see 
done  by  the  kite  and  other  birds.  Also  the  downward  movement  of 
both  the  feet  produces  twice  as  much  power  as  that  of  one:  it  is  true 
that  the  movement  is  proportionately  slower. 

The  raising  is  by  the  force  of  a  spring  or  if  you  wish  by  the  hand, 
or  by  drawing  the  feet  towards  you,  and  this  is  best  for  then  you  will 
have  the  hands  more  free.  b  74  v.

This  can  be  made  with  one  pair  of  wings  and  also  with  two. 

If  you  should  wish  to  make  it  with  one,  the  arms  will  raise  it  by 
means  of  a  windlass,  and  two  vigorous  kicks  with  the  heels  will  lower 
it,  and  this  will  be  useful. 

And  if  you  wish  to  make  it  with  two  pairs,  when  one  leg  is  extended 
it  will  lower  one  pair  of  wings  and  at  the  same  time  the  windlass 
worked  by  the  hands  will  raise  the  others,  helping  also  considerably 
those  that  fall,  and  by  turning  the  hands  first  to  the  right  and  then  to 
the  left  you  will  help  first  the  one  and  then  the  other.  This  instrument 
resembles  the  large  one  on  the  opposite  page  (  b  80  r.)  except  that  in 
this  the  traction  is  twisted  on  the  wheel  M  and  goes  to  the  feet. 

In  place  of  the  feet  you  should  make  a  ladder  in  three  parts  of  three 
poles  of  fir,  light  and  slender,  as  is  represented  here  in  front,  and  it

you  will  exert  a  force  equal  to  four  hundred  pounds,  and  it  will  be  as 
rapid  as  the  movement  of  the  heels.  b  79  v.

pounds,  and  with  his  hands  a  force  of  two  hundred  pounds,  and  this 

is  what  the  man  weighs. 

The  movement  of  the  wings  will  be  crosswise  after  the  manner  of 

the  gait  of  the  horse. 
So  for  this  reason  I  maintain  that  this  method  is  better  than  any

Ladder  for  ascending  and  descending;  let  it  be  twelve  braccia  high, 
and  let  the  span  of  the  wings  be  forty  braccia,  and  their  elevation  eight 
braccia,  and  the  body  from  stern  to  prow  twenty  braccia  and  its  height 
five  braccia  and  let  the  outside  cover  be  all  of  cane  and  cloth,   b  80  r. 

[With  drawing  of  screw  revolving  round  vertical  axis] 

Let  the  outer  extremity  of  the  screw  be  of  steel  wire  as  thick  as  a 
cord,  and  from  the  circumference  to  the  centre  let  it  be  eight  braccia. 

I  find  that  if  this  instrument  made  with  a  screw  be  well  made — that 
is  to  say,  made  of  linen  of  which  the  pores  are  stopped  up  with  starch — 
and  be  turned  swiftly,  the  said  screw  will  make  its  spiral  in  the  air  and 
it  will  rise  high. 

Take  the  example  of  a  wide  and  thin  ruler  whirled  very  rapidly  in 
the  air,  you  will  see  that  your  arm  will  be  guided  by  the  line  of  the 
edge  of  the  said  flat  surface. 

The  framework  of  the  above-mentioned  linen  should  be  of  long  stout 
cane.  You  may  make  a  small  model  of  pasteboard,  of  which  the  axis 
is  formed  of  fine  steel  wire,  bent  by  force,  and  as  it  is  released  it  will 
turn  the  screw.  b  83  v. 

[With  drawing] 

If  you  wish  to  see  a  real  test  of  the  wings  make  them  of  pasteboard 
covered  by  net,  and  make  the  rods  of  cane,  the  wing  being  at  least 
twenty  braccia  in  length  and  breadth,  and  fix  it  over  a  plank  of  a 
weight  of  two  hundred  pounds,  and  make  in  the  manner  represented 
above1  a  force  that  is  rapid;  and  if  the  plank  of  two  hundred  pounds 
is  raised  up  before  the  wing  is  lowered  the  test  is  satisfactory,  but  see 
that  the  force  works  rapidly,  and  if  the  aforesaid  result  does  not  follow 
do  not  lose  any  more  time. 

If  by  reason  of  its  nature  this  wing  ought  to  fall  in  four  spaces  of 
time  and  you  by  your  mechanism  cause  it  to  fall  in  two  the  result  will 
be  that  the  plank  of  two  hundred  pounds  will  be  raised  up. 

You  know  that  if  you  find  yourself  standing  in  deep  water  holding 
your  arms  stretched  out  and  then  let  them  fall  naturally  the  arms  will 
proceed  to  fall  as  far  as  the  thighs  and  the  man  will  remain  in  the  first 
position. 

But  if  you  make  the  arms  which  would  naturally  fall  in  four  spaces 

1  In  the  drawing  the  figure  of  a  man  is  seen  working  a  lever. 


FLYING   MACHINE  501 

of  time  fall  in  two  then  know  that  the  man  will  quit  his  position  and 
moving  violently  will  take  up  a  fresh  position  on  the  surface  of  the 


water. 


And  know  that  if  the  above-named  plank  weighs  two  hundred 
pounds  a  hundred  of  these  will  be  borne  by  the  man  who  holds  the 
lever  in  his  hand  and  a  hundred  will  be  carried  upon  the  air  by  the 
medium  of  the  wing.  b  88  v. 

Make  the  ladders  curved  to  correspond  with  the  body. 

When  the  foot  of  the  ladder  a  touches  the  ground  it  cannot  give 
a  blow  to  cause  injury  to  the  instrument  because  it  is  a  cone  which 
buries  itself  and  does  not  find  any  obstacle  at  its  point,  and  this  is 
perfect. 

Make  trial  of  the  actual  machine  over  the  water  so  that  if  you  fall 
you  do  not  do  yourself  any  harm. 

These  hooks  that  are  underneath  the  feet  of  the  ladder  act  in  the 
same  way  as  when  one  jumps  on  the  points  of  one's  toes  for  then  one 
is  not  stunned  as  is  the  person  who  jumps  upon  his  heels. 

This  is  the  procedure  when  you  wish  to  rise  from  an  open  plain: 
these  ladders  serve  the  same  purpose  as  the  legs  and  you  can  beat  the 
wings  while  it  is  rising.  Observe  the  swift,  how  when  it  has  settled  itself 
upon  the  ground  it  cannot  rise  flying  because  its  legs  are  short.  But 
when  you  have  raised  yourself,  draw  up  the  ladders  as  I  show  in  the 
second  figure  above.  b  89  r. 

[Artificial  wings] 

In  constructing  wings  one  should  make  one  cord  to  bear  the  strain 
and  a  looser  one  in  the  same  position  so  that  if  the  one  breaks  under 
the  strain  the  other  is  in  position  to  serve  the  same  function,  h  29  v.

SHUTTERS  IN  FLYING  MACHINES 

The  smaller  these  shutters  the  more  useful  are  they. 
And  they  will  be  protected  by  a  framework  of  cane  upon  which  is 
drawn  a  piece  of  gauze  and  as  it  slants  upward  the  movement  of  the 


502  FLYING   MACHINE 

whole  is  transversal,  and  such  lines  of  shutters  come  to  open  by  a  slant- 
ing line  and  consequently  the  process  of  rising  is  not  impeded.

HELM  OF  FLYING  MACHINES 

Here  the  head  n  is  the  mover  of  this  helm,  that  is  that  when  n  goes 
towards  b  the  helm  becomes  widened,  and  when  it  goes  in  the  opposite 
direction  the  tail  is  contracted;  and  similarly  when  /  is  lowered  the  tail 
is  lowered  on  this  side,  and  so  lowering  itself  on  the  opposite  side  it  will 
do  the  same. 

Of  necessity  in  flight  at  uniform  altitude  the  lowering  of  the  wings 
will  be  as  great  as  their  elevation.  l  59  r. 

When  the  mover  of  the  flying  body  has  power  divisible  in  four 
through  its  four  chief  ministering  members,  it  will  then  be  able  to 
employ  them  equally  and  also  unequally  and  also  all  equally  and  all 
unequally,  according  to  the  dictates  of  the  various  movements  of  the 
flying  body. 

If  they  are  all  moved  equally  the  flying  body  will  be  of  regular 
movement. 

If  they  are  used  unequally,  as  it  would  be  in  continuous  proportion, 
the  flying  body  will  be  in  circling  movement.  l  60  v. 

Suppose  that  here  there  is  a  body  suspended,  which  resembles  that 
of  a  bird,  and  that  its  tail  is  twisted  to  an  angle  of  various  different 
degrees;  you  will  be  able  by  means  of  this  to  deduce  a  general  rule  as 
to  the  various  twists  and  turns  in  the  movements  of  birds  occasioned 
by  the  bending  of  their  tails. 

In  all  the  varieties  of  movements  the  heaviest  part  of  the  thing  which 
moves  becomes  the  guide  of  the  movement.  l  61  v.

Speak  first  of  the  movement  then  of  the  weight  because  it  is  produced 
by  the  movement,  then  of  the  force  which  proceeds  from  the  weight 
and  the  movement,  then  of  the  percussion  which  springs  from  the

WHERE  THE  SCIENCE  OF  WEIGHTS  IS  LED  INTO  ERROR 
BY  THE  PRACTICE 

The  science  of  weights  is  led  into  error  by  its  practice,  and  in  many 
instances  this  is  not  in  harmony  with  this  science  nor  is  it  possible  to 
bring  it  into  harmony;  and  this  is  caused  by  the  poles  of  the  balances 
by  means  of  which  the  science  of  such  weights  is  formed,  which  poles 
according  to  the  ancient  philosophers  were  placed  by  nature  as  poles  of 
a  mathematical  line  and  in  some  cases  in  mathematical  points,  and 
these  points  and  lines  are  devoid  of  substance  whereas  practice  makes 
them  possessed  of  substance,  since  necessity  so  constrains  as  needful  to 
support  the  weight  of  these  balances  together  with  the  weights  which 
are  reckoned  upon  them. 

I  have  found  that  the  ancients  were  in  error  in  their  reckoning  of 
weights,  and  that  this  error  has  arisen  because  in  a  considerable  part  of 

503 


504  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

their  science  they  have  made  use  of  poles  which  had  substance  and  in  a 
considerable  part  of  mathematical  poles,  that  is  such  as  exist  in  the 
mind  or  are  without  substance;  which  errors  I  set  down  here  below. 

c.a.  93  v.  b 

OF  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

In  equal  movements  made  in  equal  time  the  mover  will  always  have 
more  power  than  the  thing  which  is  moved.  And  the  mover  will  be  so 
much  the  more  powerful  than  the  thing  moved  in  proportion  as  the 
movement  of  this  thing  moved  exceeds  the  length  of  movement  of  its 
mover;  and  the  difference  of  the  power  of  the  mover  over  that  of  the 
thing  moved  will  be  so  much  less  in  proportion  as  the  length  of 
the  movement  made  by  the  thing  moved  is  less  than  the  movement 
of  this  mover. 

But  observe,  O  reader,  that  in  this  case  you  must  take  count  of  the 
air  which  becomes  so  much  the  more  condensed  in  front  of  the  thing 
moved  as  this  thing  moved  is  of  greater  speed;  for  this  air  is  capable  of 
being  condensed  in  an  infinite  degree.  This  however  could  not  happen 
with  the  movements  made  by  things  which  are  moved  within  water, 
for  this  is  not  capable  of  being  condensed,  as  may  be  proved  by  placing 
it  in  a  vessel  with  a  narrow  mouth,  since  for  lack  of  the  knowledge  of 
some  motive  power  you  will  not  be  able  to  place  within  it  more  than 
the  natural  capacity  the  vessel  will  contain.  And  it  is  just  the  contrary 
with  the  air,  for  if  it  is  forced  into  vessels  with  very  narrow  mouths 
which  contain  a  quantity  of  water,  and  the  vessel  is  tilted  at  such  an 
angle  that  the  water  shut  up  in  it  is  between  the  mouth  of  the  vessel 
and  the  air  which  has  been  condensed,  the  power  of  the  condensed  air 
drives  the  water  of  the  vessel  with  such  fury  as  to  penetrate  through 
the  air  for  some  distance,  until  the  air  that  remains  in  the  vessel  can 
return  to  its  first  natural  state. 

But  to  return  to  our  proposition,  we  may  say  that  among  movable 
things  of  the  same  gravity  that  one  will  have  the  slower  movement  of 
which  the  front  that  cleaves  the  air  takes  up  more  space;  and  so  con- 
versely as  it  occupies  less  air,  not  however  extending  itself  in  such  a 
degree  of  thinness  as  to  cause  its  weight  to  fail,  for  where  there  is  no 
weight  there  is  no  local  movement  through  the  air. 


MOVEMENT  AND   WEIGHT  505 

There  can  be  no  local  movement  through  the  air  unless  it  proceeds 
from  greater  or  less  density  than  the  density  of  this  air. 

And  if  my  opponent  should  maintain  that  the  density  which  the 
condensed  air  acquires  in  front  of  the  thing  moved  is  the  same  in 
front  of  the  mover,  and  is  so  much  the  more  in  the  case  of  the  mover 
in  proportion  as  it  comes  in  contact  with  a  greater  quantity  of  air  in 
front  of  itself  when  struck  and  condensed  than  does  the  thing  moved 
by  it,  as  we  see  with  a  hand  when  it  throws  a  stone  through  the  air: 
the  answer  to  this  is  that  it  is  impossible  for  the  movement  of  the 
mover  added  to  the  movement  of  the  thing  moved  to  be  either  swifter 
or  less  swift  than  the  movement  made  by  the  thing  moved,  nor  can  it 
ever  be  that  in  any  part  of  its  accidental  movement  its  speed  equals  that 
of  its  mover;  and  this  is  proved  in  the  accidental  movement,  where  the 
thing  moved  lessens  its  speed  at  every  stage  of  its  movement,  although 
the  percussion  of  the  thing  moved  is  greater  at  some  distance  from  the 
mover  than  it  is  when  close  at  hand. 

And  this  we  see  with  an  arrow  from  a  bow  when  its  point  is  resting 
against  wood,  for  though  the  cord  drive  it  with  all  the  force  of  the 
bow  it  only  penetrates  the  wood  a  very  little  distance,  but  does  the  con- 
trary if  it  has  some  movement.  Some  say  that  the  arrow  in  moving 
propels  a  wave  of  air  in  front  of  itself,  and  that  this  wave  by  means  of 
its  movement  prevents  the  course  of  the  arrow  from  being  impeded. 
This  is  incorrect  however  because  everything  which  is  moved  exhausts 
and  impedes  its  mover.  The  air  therefore  which  passes  in  waves  in  front 
of  the  arrow  does  so  because  of  the  movement  of  this  arrow,  and  it 
lends  little  or  no  help  of  movement  to  its  mover,  which  has  to  be 
moved  by  the  same  mover,  but  rather  checks  and  shortens  the  move- 
ment of  the  thing  moved. 

The  impetus  generated  in  still  water  has  a  different  efTect  from  that 
generated  in  still  air.  This  is  proved  from  the  fact  that  water  in  itself  is 
never  compressed  by  means  of  any  movement  made  below  its  surface, 
as  the  air  is  within  itself  when  struck  by  a  moving  thing.  And  this  we 
may  readily  learn  from  the  bubbles  with  which  the  water  is  encum- 
bered from  its  surface  to  its  bed,  which  cluster  round  about  as  the 
water  fills  up  the  vacuum  of  itself  that  the  fish  leaves  behind  it  as  it 
penetrates;  and  the  movements  of  this  water  strike  and  drive  this  fish, 
because  water  only  has  weight  within  water  when  it  has  movement, 


5o6  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

and  this  is  the  primary  cause  of  the  increase  of  movement  for  its  mover. 

c.a.  108  r.  a 

I  find  that  force  is  infinite  together  with  time;  and  that  weight  is 
finite  together  with  the  weight  of  the  whole  globe  of  the  terrestrial 
machine. 

I  find  that  the  stroke  of  indivisible  time  is  movement,  and  that  this 
movement  is  of  many  varieties,  namely  natural,  accidental  and  partici- 
pating; and  this  participating  movement  ends  its  greatest  power  when 
it  changes  from  the  accidental  to  the  natural,  that  is  in  the  middle  of 
its  course;  and  the  natural  is  more  powerful  at  the  end  than  in  any 
other  place;  the  accidental  is  strongest  in  the  third  and  weakest  at  the 
close.  c.a.  117  r.  c 

Weight,  force,  a  blow  and  impetus  are  the  children  of  movement 
because  they  are  born  from  it. 

Weight  and  force  always  desire  their  death,  and  each  is  maintained 
by  violence. 

Impetus  is  frequently  the  cause  why  movement  prolongs  the  desire 
of  the  thing  moved.  c.a.  123  r.  a 

Of  water  of  uniform  weight,  depth,  breadth  and  declivity  that  por- 
tion is  swifter  which  is  nearest  the  surface;  and  this  occurs  because  the 
water  that  is  uppermost  is  contiguous  to  the  air,  which  offers  but  little 
resistance  through  its  being  lighter  than  the  water;  and  the  water  that 
is  below  is  contiguous  to  the  earth,  which  offers  great  resistance  through 
being  immovable  and  heavier  than  water.  It  follows  that  the  part  which 
is  more  distant  from  this  base  has  less  resistance  than  that  above  which 
is  contiguous  to  the  air,  for  this  is  light  and  mobile.  c.a.  124  r.  a 

Gravity  and  levity  are  accidental  powers  which  are  produced  by  one 
element  being  drawn  through  or  driven  into  another. 
No  element  has  gravity  or  levity  within  its  own  element. 

c.a.  131  r.  b 

If  all  the  bed  of  the  sea  were  covered  with  men  lying  down  these  men 
would  sustain  the  whole  of  the  element  of  water,  consequently  each 
man  would  find  that  he  had  a  column  of  water  a  mile  long  upon  his 
back.  For  if  the  whole  sea  is  all  supported  upon  its  bed  each  part  of  the 
bed  sustains  its  part  of  the  water.  c.a.  153  r.  a 


MOVEMENT   AND   WEIGHT  507 

Impetus  at  every  stage  of  time  becomes  less  by  degrees,  and  the  pro- 
longation of  its  essence  is  caused  by  the  air  or  the  water,  which  closes 
up  behind  the  movable  thing,  filling  up  the  vacuum  which  the  movable 
thing  that  penetrates  it  leaves  of  itself.  And  this  air  is  more  powerful  to 
strike  and  compress  the  movable  thing  by  direct  percussion,  than  is  the 
air  which  is  so  olaced  as  to  resist  the  penetration  of  this  movable  thing 
by  becoming  compressed;  and  it  is  this  compression  of  the  air  which 
diminishes  the  fury  of  the  aforesaid  impetus  in  the  movable  thing. 

Impetus  is  the  impression  of  local  movement  transmuted  from  the 
mover  to  the  movable  thing  and  maintained  by  the  air  or  by  the  water 
as  they  move  in  order  to  prevent  the  vacuum. 

The  impetus  of  the  movable  thing  within  the  water  is  different  from 
the  impetus  of  the  movable  thing  within  the  air,  and  these  differences 
result  from  the  varieties  of  the  aforesaid  liquids,  because  air  is  con- 
densable to  infinity  and  water  is  not. 

The  impetus  of  the  water  is  divided  into  two  parts  through  its  being 
of  two  natures,  one  of  which  is  simple  and  the  other  complex.  The 
simple  is  entirely  beneath  the  surface  of  the  water,  the  other  is  complex, 
that  is  it  is  between  the  air  and  the  water,  as  is  seen  with  boats. 

The  simple  impetus  does  not  condense  the  water  in  front  of  the 
movement  of  the  fish,  but  moves  the  water  behind  the  movement  of 
the  fish  with  the  same  speed  that  the  mover  has;  and  the  wave  of  the 
water  that  is  over  against  it  will  never  be  swifter  than  its  mover. 

But  the  movement  of  the  boat,  called  complex  movement  because  it 
shares  with  the  water  and  the  air,  is  divided  into  three  chief  parts 
because  this  movement  is  carried  on  in  three  directions,  namely  against 
the  course  of  the  river,  in  the  direction  of  its  current,  and  crosswise, 
that  is  along  the  breadth  of  the  river.  c.a.  168  v.  b 

If  the  movement  of  the  oar  or  of  the  wing  be  swifter  than  the  water 
or  the  air  driven  by  them,  that  amount  of  movement  which  is  left  in 
the  water  or  the  air  is  completed  by  the  oar  or  the  wing  in  an  opposite 
movement. 

But  if  the  movement  of  this  water  or  air  be  in  itself  swifter  than  that 
of  the  oar  or  wing  this  oar  and  wing  will  not  move  against  this  water 
or  air. 


5o8  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

And  if  the  movement  of  the  water  or  of  the  air  be  in  itself  of  the 
same  swiftness  as  that  of  the  oar  or  the  wing  that  moves  in  it  then  the 
oar  and  wing  will  follow  the  movement  of  the  water  and  the  air. 

c.a.  175  v.  b 

The  compression  which  the  flame  produces  of  itself,  which  increases 
within  the  resisting  wall  of  the  mortar,  is  that  which  produces  the  im- 
petuous movement  of  its  ball;  and  this  impetus  cannot  be  created  with 
less  density  of  flame  or  less  swiftness  in  its  rate  of  increase.  Such  swift- 
ness of  increase  cannot  take  place  within  a  wall  of  less  resistance  than 
that  of  this  mortar.  It  follows  therefore  that  the  expansion  which  the 
flame  makes  as  it  rushes  out  of  the  mortar  into  the  air,  losing  this 
density  and  directness  of  course,  causes  a  loss  of  as  much  density  as  it 
acquires  in  its  expansion  and  it  ceases  to  follow  the  flight  of  the  ball  to 
the  extent  to  which  it  bends  to  the  .  .  .  c.a.  176  v.  a 

The  movement  of  water  within  water  acts  as  the  movement  of  air 
within  air.  c.a.  184  v.  a 

Anything  which  descends  freely  acquires  fresh  momentum  at  every 
stage  of  its  movement. 

If  a  power  can  move  a  body  through  a  certain  space  in  a  certain  time 
it  does  not  necessarily  follow  that  the  half  of  this  power  will  move  the 
whole  of  the  body  over  half  the  space  in  the  whole  of  that  time,  or  over 
the  whole  of  the  space  in  double  the  time.  c.a.  202  v.  b 

Movements  are  of  [.  .  .]  kinds  of  which  the  first  is  called  temporal, 
because  it  is  concerned  solely  with  the  movement  of  time,  and  this 
embraces  within  itself  all  the  others;  the  second  is  concerned  with  the 
life  of  things;  the  third  is  termed  mental,  and  this  resides  in  animated 
bodies;  the  fourth  is  that  of  the  images  of  things  which  are  spread 
through  the  air  in  straight  lines:  this  class  does  not  appear  to  be  subject 
to  time,  for  it  is  made  indivisible  in  time  and  that  which  cannot  be 
divided  in  the  mind  is  not  found  among  us;  the  fifth  is  that  of  sounds 
which  proceed  through  the  air,  and  this  will  be  treated  of  later,  as  also 
of  odours  and  savours,  and  this  we  may  call  movement  of  the  senses; 
the  other  is  called  material  movement,  concerning  which  we  shall 
make  our  treatise. 


MOVEMENT  AND   WEIGHT  509 

But  we  shall  define  movements  merely  as  being  of  two  kinds,  of 
which  one  is  material  and  the  other  incorporeal,  because  it  is  not  per- 
ceptible to  the  visual  sense,  or  we  may  say  that  the  one  is  visible  the 
other  invisible,  although  among  the  invisible  movements  there  are  a 
considerable  number  of  material  movements,  such  as  the  movement 
of  Saturn,  and  as  there  would  be  with  a  number  of  wheels  revolving. 
Wherefore  we  may  say  that  the  two  kinds  of  movement  are  such  that 
the  one  is  that  which  is  united  with  bodies  the  other  with  the  spirit.  But 
among  these  movements  that  of  the  images  of  things  amid  the  air  is 
swiftest,  because  it  covers  a  great  space  at  the  same  time  as  it  is  very 
brief,  and  this  loses  [.  .  .]  through  distance,  because  the  air  thickens; 
the  second  is  that  of  the  mind. 

Of  the  movements  of  the  senses  we  will  only  mention  that  of  hearing 
because  it  operates  in  visible  bodies,  and  works  by  means  of  time,  as  is 
shown  in  noises,  peals  of  thunder,  sounds  and  voices.  Of  smell  taste  and 
touch  we  will  not  speak,  because  they  do  not  form  part  of  our  subject. 

Also  one  might  speak  of  the  influences  of  the  planets  and  of  God.

THE  HEAVIEST  PART  OF  A  MOVABLE  BODY  BECOMES  THE 
GUIDE  OF  ITS  MOVEMENT 

If  a  power  moves  a  weight  a  certain  distance  in  a  certain  time  the 
same  power  will  move  the  half  of  this  weight  double  the  distance  in 
the  same  time. 

Or  this  whole  power  [will  move]  all  the  weight  half  the  distance  in 
half  the  time,  or  the  whole  power  in  the  same  time  will  move  double 
the  weight  half  the  distance,  or  the  whole  power  in  half  the  time  [will 
move]  the  whole  weight  half  the  distance.  c.a.  212  v.  b 

WHAT  IS  IMPETUS? 

Impetus  is  a  power  transmitted  from  the  mover  to  the  movable  thing, 
and  maintained  by  the  wave  of  the  air  within  the  air  which  this  mover 
produces;  and  this  arises  from  the  vacuum  which  would  be  produced 
contrary  to  the  natural  law  if  the  air  which  is  in  front  of  it  did  not  fill 
up  the  vacuum,  so  causing  the  air  which  is  driven  from  its  place  by 


5io  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

the  aforesaid  mover  to  flee  away.  And  the  air  that  goes  before  it  would 
not  fill  up  the  place  from  which  it  is  divided  if  it  were  not  that  another 
body  of  air  filled  up  the  place  from  whence  this  air  was  divided;  and  so 
of  necessity  it  follows  in  succession.  And  this  movement  would  con- 
tinue to  infinity  if  the  air  were  capable  of  being  condensed  to  infinity.

WHAT  DIFFERENCE  THERE  IS  BETWEEN  FORCE  AND 

WEIGHT 

Force  is  spiritual  essence  which  by  fortuitous  violence  is  united  to 
weighty  bodies,  restrained  from  following  their  natural  inclination,  in 
which,  although  of  brief  duration,  it  nevertheless  often  shows  itself  of 
marvellous  power.  c.a.  253  r.  c 

[A  hymn  to  force] 

Force  is  all  in  the  whole  of  itself  and  all  in  every  part  of  itself. 

Force  is  a  spiritual  capacity,  an  invisible  power  which  is  implanted 
by  accidental  violence  in  all  bodies  that  are  withheld  from  their  natural 
inclination. 

Force  is  nothing  else  than  a  spiritual  capacity,  an  invisible  power 
which  is  created  and  implanted  by  accidental  violence  by  sensible  bodies 
in  insensible  ones,  giving  to  these  a  semblance  of  life;  and  this  life  is 
marvellous  in  its  workings,  constraining  and  transforming  in  place  and 
shape  all  created  things,  running  with  fury  to  its  own  destruction,  and 
producing  different  effects  in  its  course  as  occasion  requires. 

Tarrying  makes  it  great  and  quickness  makes  it  weak. 

It  lives  by  violence  and  dies  from  liberty. 

It  transforms  and  constrains  every  body  with  change  of  position  and 
form. 

Great  power  gives  it  great  desire  of  death. 

It  drives  away  with  fury  whatever  opposes  its  destruction. 

Transmuter  of  various  forms. 

Lives  always  in  hostility  to  whoever  controls  it. 

Always  sets  itself  against  natural  desires. 

From  small  beginnings  it  slowly  becomes  larger,  and  makes  itself  a 
dreadful  and  marvellous  power. 


MOVEMENT   AND   WEIGHT  511 

And  constraining  itself  it  constrains  everything. 

.  .  .  dwells  in  bodies  which  are  kept  away  from  their  natural  course 
and  use. 

.  .  .  willingly  consumes  itself. 

.  .  .  force  is  all  in  all  and  all  through  all  the  body  where  it  is  pro- 
duced. 

.  .  .  Power  (.  .  .  nza)   [potenza?]  is  only  a  desire  of  flight. 

Always  it  desires  to  grow  weak  and  to  spend  itself. 

Itself  constrained  it  constrains  every  body. 

Without  it  nothing  moves. 

Without  it  no  sound  or  voice  is  heard. 

Its  true  seed  is  in  sentient  bodies. 

Weight  is  all  in  all  its  vertical  obstacle  and  all  in  every  part  of  it. 

If  the  oblique  obstacle  opposed  to  the  weight  is  loosened  and  free  it 
will  not  make  any  resistance  to  this  weight  but  will  fall  down  with  it  in 
ruin. 

Weight  naturally  passes  to  its  desired  position. 

Every  part  of  this  force  contains  the  whole  opposite  to  weight. 

And  often  they  are  victors  one  over  the  other. 

They  are  in  the  grip  of  the  same  natural  law,  and  the  more  powerful 
conquers  the  less. 

Weight  changes  [its  position]  unwillingly  and  force  is  always  on  the 
point  of  fleeing. 

Weight  is  corporeal  and  force  is  incorporeal. 

Weight  is  material  and  force  is  spiritual. 

If  the  one  desires  flight  from  itself  and  death,  the  other  wishes  for 
stability  and  permanence. 

They  are  often  producers  one  of  another: 

If  weight  brings  forth  force  and  force  weight. 

If  weight  conquers  force  and  force  weight. 

And  if  they  are  of  like  nature  they  make  long  company. 

If  the  one  is  eternal  the  other  is  fleeting.  c.a.  302  v.  b 

OF  THE  PROPORTION  OF  FORCE  AND  MOVEMENT 

I  ask  whether  if  an  arrow  is  shot  from  a  cross-bow  [a  distance  of] 
four  hundred  braccia  a  cross-bow  made  in  the  same  proportions  but  of 


5i2  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

four  times  the  force  and  size  will  not  send  the  arrow  four  times  as  far. 

I  ask  if  you  have  cross-bows,  of  equal  weight,  and  elevated  in  these 
various  thicknesses,  [diagram]  of  the  same  length,  what  effect  will  it 
make  in  the  distances  upon  the  same  arrow. 

And  if  a  cross-bow  sends  an  arrow  weighing  two  ounces  a  distance 
of  four  hundred  braccia  how  many  braccia  will  it  send  one  of  four 
ounces  ? 

Force 

Force  cannot  exist  in  bodies  without  either  force  or  weight  together 
with  movement. 

Force  is  caused  by  violent  movement  by  means  of  weight  or  other 
force. 

If  a  thing  which  moves  continuously  is  given  fresh  momentum  by 
greater  movement  the  thing  moved  redoubles  the  velocity  of  its  move- 
ment: for  example  a  revolving  wheel,  such  as  the  potter's  lathe  which 
revolves; — by  adding  to  it  the  movement  of  the  foot  this  wheel  becomes 
swifter;  also  if  a  ball  moving  in  a  certain  direction  be  struck  by  the 
player  along  the  line  of  its  movement  this  movement  will  be  accelerated. 

c.a.  314  v.  b 

THE  MOVEMENT  OF  A  HEAVY  SUBSTANCE 

The  movement  made  by  a  spherical  heavy  substance  in  the  air. 

There  are  two  movements  which  can  be  made  by  a  spherical  heavy 
substance  in  the  air,  one  of  which  is  called  simple,  the  other  compound. 
Simple  is  that  movement  in  which  the  surface  of  the  movable  thing 
moves  as  much  as  its  centre;  compound  is  that  in  which  the  surface  of 
the  movable  thing  is  in  itself  more  swift  than  its  centre. 

Simple  movement 

Simple  movement  is  that  in  which  the  movable  thing  moves  equally 
in  every  part. 

In  compound  movement  there  is  no  part  which  moves  with  a  move- 
ment equal  to  that  of  the  whole,  unless  it  is  the  diameter,  which  makes 
itself  the  seat  of  the  revolving  movement. 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  513 

The  compound  movement  is  transformed  into  as  many  different 
aspeets  as  there  are  different  sides  with  which  it  strikes  against  the 
obstacles  that  are  in  its  path. 

The  simple  movement  is  changed  into  compound  movement,  if  its 
movement  is  impeded  in  any  part  of  its  sides. 

In  a  long  course  compound  movement  made  in  the  air  resolves  itself 
into  simple  movement;  and  the  fact  of  this  happening  makes  it  more 
certain  that  the  cause  of  the  simple  movement  is  also  the  cause  of  the 
compound  movement;  and  this  is  shown  in  every  wheel  to  which  the 
revolving  impulse  is  imparted,  for  it  endures  but  little  and  is  constantly 
growing  less.  c.a.  315  r.  a 

Every  impetuous  movement  bends  towards  the  less  resistance  as  it 
flies  from  the  greater.  c.a.  315  r.  b 

Force  is  caused  by  the  movement  of  the  lever  in  its  counterlever,  and 
by  this  it  is  infused  into  the  bodies  which  it  moves.        c.a.  316  v.  b 

Every  heavy  substance  not  held  back  out  of  its  natural  place  desires 
to  descend  more  by  a  direct  line  than  by  an  arc.  This  is  shown  because 
every  body  whatever  it  may  be,  that  is  away  from  its  natural  placer 
which  preserves  it,  desires  to  regain  its  first  perfection  in  as  brief  a 
space  of  time  as  possible;  and  since  the  chord  is  described  in  a  less  time 
than  the  arc  of  the  same  chord  it  follows  from  this  that  every  body 
which  is  away  from  its  natural  place  desires  to  descend  more  speedily 
by  a  chord  than  by  an  arc. 

From  this  three  things  follow: — the  first  is  that  the  movement  of 
gravity  in  the  balance  is  not  entirely  natural.  This  is  evident  from  the 
fact  that  the  arms  of  this  balance  as  they  descend  describe  an  arc,  and 
as  a  consequence  curved  lines.  The  second  is  that  the  heavy  movement 
in  the  arm  of  the  balance  which  descends  is  not  entirely  violent,  since 
in  this  manner  it  acquires  in  its  descent  natural  movement. 

The  third  is  that  the  heavy  movement  in  the  balance  is  half-way 
between  the  natural  and  the  violent. 

This  is  evident  seeing  that  every  natural  movement  is  violent  or 
indeed  is  beyond  nature.  ca.  335  v.  f 

Among  bodies  of  varying  substance  and  of  similar  shape  that  which, 
has  most  weight  descends  most  rapidly. 


5i4  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

Proposition 

That  spherical  and  heavy  body  is  of  the  slowest  movement  in  which 
the  contact  that  it  makes  with  the  plane  where  it  touches  is  nearest  to 
the  perpendicular  drawn  from  its  centre.  c.a.  338  r.  b 

Weight.  [With  diagrams] 

The  middle  of  each  weight  is  in  a  perpendicular  line  with  the  centre 
of  its  support. 

When  a  man  standing  or  sitting  takes  a  weight  in  his  arms  it  is 
necessary  for  the  support  on  which  he  is  resting  to  be  in  the  middle 
between  this  weight  and  himself. 

It  is  impossible  for  the  force  exerted  by  a  man's  arm  to  be  able  with 
the  weight  supported  by  it  to  extend  beyond  the  upright  position  with- 
out the  counter  action  of  the  above  named  opposite  weight. 

Suppose  you  were  to  say: — I  wish  to  lean  my  whole  back  against  a 
wall,  and  sit  on  the  ground  with  legs  extended  in  such  a  way  as  to 
touch  the  whole  corner  with  legs  and  back,  and  I  will  take  a  weight 
in  my  hands  and  bring  it  near  to  me  and  move  it  away  with  the  actual 
force  of  my  arms,  and  I  shall  not  be  moving  my  back  or  my  head  or 
any  part  of  me  so  as  to  create  any  counterpoise  to  the  weight  moved 
by  my  arms,  and  nevertheless  this  will  be  done  effectively. 

To  this  I  reply  that  the  effect  which  the  force  exerts  will  not  in  this 
case  extend  to  any  other  function  than  that  of  keeping  the  arms  united 
with  the  trunk,  as  though  without  flexible  joints  and  in  one  single 
piece,  making  this  piece  like  a  bar  of  iron  bent  in  two  right  angles, 
the  extremity  of  the  upper  part  carrying  itself  in  a  perpendicular  line 
as  far  as  the  middle  of  the  base  or  the  opposite  lower  part,  and  if  there 
is  the  burden  of  a  weight  superimposed  upon  this  upper  extremity  this 
weight  will  exert  force  below  itself  upon  the  perpendicular  line  of  its 
base.  c.a.  349  r.  b 

A  man  about  to  give  a  great  blow  with  his  arms  so  places  himself 
that  all  his  power  is  on  the  opposite  side  to  that  of  the  place  at  which 
he  intends  to  strike,  for  the  thing  which  moves  most  exerts  most  power 
upon  the  thing  that  resists  the  movement.  c.a.  352  v.  c 

Every  impression  is  preserved  for  a  time  in  its  sensitive  object; 
and  that  which  was  of  greater  power  will  be  preserved  in  its  ob' 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  515 

ject  for  a  longer  time,  and  for  a  shorter  time  with  the  less  powerful. 

In  this  connection  I  apply  the  term  sensitive  to  such  object  as  by  any 
impression  is  changed  from  that  which  was  at  first  an  insensitive  ob- 
ject;— that  is  one  which,  while  changing  from  its  first  state  preserves 
within  itself  no  impression  of  the  thing  which  has  moved  it.  The  sensi- 
ble impression  is  that  of  a  blow  received  upon  a  resounding  substance, 
such  as  bells  and  suchlike  things,  or  like  the  note  in  the  ear,  which, 
indeed,  unless  it  preserved  the  impression  of  the  notes,  could  never 
derive  pleasure  from  hearing  a  voice  alone;  for  when  it  passes  imme- 
diately from  the  first  to  the  fifth  note  the  effect  is  as  though  one  heard 
these  two  notes  at  the  same  time,  and  thus  perceived  the  true  harmony 
which  the  first  makes  with  the  fifth;  but  if  the  impression  of  the  first 
note  did  not  remain  in  the  ear  for  an  appreciable  space  of  time,  the 
fifth,  which  follows  immediately  after  the  first,  would  seem  alone,  and 
one  note  cannot  create  any  harmony,  and  consequently  any  song  what- 
soever occurring  alone  would  seem  to  be  devoid  of  charm. 

So,  too,  the  radiance  of  the  sun  or  other  luminous  body  remains  in 
the  eye  for  some  time  after  it  has  been  seen;  and  the  motion  of  a  single 
firebrand  whirled  rapidly  in  a  circle  causes  this  circle  to  seem  one  con- 
tinuous and  uniform  flame. 

The  drops  of  rain  water  seem  continuous  threads  descending  from 
their  clouds;  and  so  herein  one  may  see  how  the  eye  preserves  the 
impressions  of  the  moving  things  which  it  sees. 

The  insensitive  objects  which  do  not  preserve  the  impressions  of  the 
things  which  are  opposite  to  them  are  mirrors,  and  any  polished  sub- 
stance, which,  so  soon  as  ever  the  thing  of  which  it  bears  the  impression 
is  removed  from  before  it,  becomes  at  once  entirely  deprived  of  that 
impression.  We  may,  therefore,  conclude  that  it  is  the  action  of  the 
mover  pressing  against  the  body  moved  by  it  which  moves  this  body 
in  the  direction  in  which  it  moves. 

Amongst  the  cases  of  impressions  being  preserved  in  various  bodies 
we  may  also  instance  the  wave,  the  eddies  of  the  water,  the  winds  in 
the  air,  and  a  knife  stuck  into  a  table,  which  on  being  bent  in  one 
direction  and  then  released,  retains  for  a  long  time  a  quivering  move- 
ment, all  its  movements  being  reciprocal  one  of  another,  and  all  may 
be  said  to  be  approaching  towards  the  perpendicular  of  the  surface 
where  the  knife  is  fixed  by  its  point. 


5i6  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

The  voice  impresses  itself  through  the  air  without  displacement  of 
air,  and  strikes  upon  the  objects  and  returns  back  to  its  source. 

The  concussion  of  liquid  with  solid  bodies  is  of  a  different  character 
from  the  above-mentioned  cases  of  concussion;  and  the  concussion  of 
liquid  with  liquid  also  varies  from  the  foregoing. 

Of  the  concussion  of  solid  with  liquid  there  is  seen  an  example  in 
the  shores  of  the  ocean,  which  receive  the  waters  full  on  their  rocks  and 
hurl  them  against  the  steep  crags;  and  oftentimes  it  happens  that  before 
the  course  of  the  wave  is  half  completed,  the  stones  carried  by  it  return 
to  the  sea  from  whence  they  came;  and  their  power  of  destruction  is 
increased  by  the  might  of  the  wave  which  falls  back  from  the  lofty 
cliffs,  c.a.  360  r.  a 

Force  never  has  weight,  although  it  often  performs  the  function  of 
weight. 
The  force  is  always  equal  to  the  weight  which  produces  it. 
This  is  proved  by  the  .  .  .  c.a.  382  r.  a 

That  body  weighs  less  upon  the  air  which  rests  upon  a  greater  ex- 
panse of  air.  We  may  take  as  an  example  the  gold  from  which  money 
is  made  which  is  extremely  heavy,  but  which  when  spread  out  in  fine 
leaf  for  gilding  maintains  itself  upon  the  air  with  each  slightest  move- 
ment of  this  air. 

[With  drawing] 

The  hollows  of  the  wings  underneath  the  shoulders  receive  the  revo- 
lution of  the  air  near  the  starting  point  of  the  wings,  and  nature  has 
so  conditioned  them  near  to  the  starting  point  of  these  wings  by  the 
fourth  proposition  concerning  weight  where  it  is  stated  that  that  part 
of  the  support  is  most  powerful  which  is  nearest  to  its  starting  point. 

c.a.  395  r.  b 

No  element  when  united  will  have  weight  within  its  element;  there- 
fore the  parts  of  the  air  do  not  weigh  upon  the  lower  parts. 

No  body  of  dissimilar  quality  will  come  to  rest  within  this  if  it  is  at 
liberty,  because  as  this  body  has  not  the  same  quality  as  the  air  it  must 
needs  be  either  heavier  or  lighter,  and  if  it  is  heavier  it  will  drop  down, 
and  if  lighter  it  will  penetrate  upward. 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  517 

That  thing  which  has  most  conformity  with  the  clement  that  sur- 
rounds it  will  issue  forth  lrom  it  with  the  slowest  movement. 

And  the  thing  which  is  most  unlike  will  separate  itself  from  it  with 
more  impetuous  movement. 

When  the  force  generates  swifter  movement  than  the  flight  of  the 
unresisting  air  this  air  becomes  compressed  after  the  manner  of  feathers 
pressed  and  crushed  by  the  weight  of  the  sleeper.  And  that  thing  which 
drove  the  air  finding  resistance  in  it  rebounds  after  the  manner  of  a 
ball  struck  against  a  wall.  TV.  10  a 

The  line  that  is  straightest  offers  most  resistance.  Tr.  24  a 

That  thing  which  within  the  line  of  equality  shall  find  itself  at  a 
greater  distance  from  its  support  will  be  less  sustained  by  it,  as  is  shown 
below  in  m  n  [diagram]. 

That  thing  which  is  at  a  greater  distance  from  its  support  will  be  less 
sustained  by  it,  and  consequently  will  fulfil  its  natural  desire  with 
greater  liberty. 

Violent  movement  the  more  it  is  exerted  the  more  it  grows  weaker : 
natural  movement  does  the  opposite. 

That  thing  which  is  at  a  greater  distance  from  its  support  will  be  less 
sustained  by  it:  being  less  sustained  it  will  partake  more  of  its  liberty, 
and  since  the  weight  that  is  free  always  descends  the  thing  therefore 
being  weighty  will  descend  more  swiftly. 

That  part  of  the  pole  which  is  farther  from  its  support  will  be  less 
sustained  by  this  support.  Being  less  sustained  it  continues  to  follow  its 
nature  more  freely,  and  this  being  heavy  and  the  nature  of  heavy  things 
being  to  desire  to  descend  it  will  therefore  descend  more  swiftly  than 
any  other  part.  Tr.  30  a 

The  air  is  capable  of  compression  and  water  is  not;  and  when  the 
movements  which  drive  it  are  swifter  than  the  flight  of  this  air,  as  the 
part  which  is  more  caught  by  its  mover  becomes  denser  and  conse- 
quently offers  more  resistance;  and  when  the  movement  made  in  it  is 
more  rapid  than  the  escaping  power  of  this  air  its  mover  comes  to  take 
a  contrary  movement.  As  is  shown  in  the  case  of  the  birds  which  are 
not  able  to  drive  the  points  of  their  wings  downwards  with  the  speed 
with  which  they  are  moving,  because  their  motive  power  moves  them

so  much  the  less  as  the  bird  raises  itself  up  as  the  extremity  of  the  wing 
fails  to  go  down.  After  the  fashion  of  the  man  who  keeps  hands  and 
breast  close  to  a  wall  and  presses  with  his  hands  upon  this  wall  so  that 
if  the  wall  does  not  give  way  the  man  must  needs  turn  back.

of  the  fall  in  c  b,  of  what  degree  of  slant  it  shows  itself;  then  observe 
the  part  that  lies  between  the  point  of  impact  b  and  the  point  a  to 
which  it  rises;  and  make  the  angle  a  b  d  and  measure  how  it  is  shown 
in  the  tenth  of  Percussion.  And  if  you  should  be  of  opinion  that  the 
water  in  this  case  would  not  be  able  to  deflect  owing  to  some  resisting 
object  intervening  in  the  line  of  its  recoil  know  that  if  the  fall  is  of  long 
continuance  it  will  have  worn  away  every  obstacle  which  was  set  in  the 
path  of  its  springing  force.  Tr.  66  a 

AGAINST  PERPETUAL  MOTION 

No  inanimate  object  will  move  of  its  own  accord;  consequently 
when  in  motion  it  will  be  moved  by  unequal  power,  unequal  that  is  in 
time  and  velocity,  or  unequal  in  weight;  and  when  the  impulse  of  the 
first  motive  power  ceases  the  second  will  cease  abruptly.  a  22  v. 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  519 

[Of  force  and  spherical  body  \ 

Every  spherical  body  of  thick  and  resisting  surface  when  moved  by 
a  like  force,  will  make  as  much  movement  in  the  rebounds  caused  by 
its  impact  upon  a  concrete  ground  as  if  it  were  thrown  freely  through 
the  air. 

How  admirable  Thy  justice,  O  Thou  First  Mover!  Thou  hast  not 
willed  that  any  power  should  lack  the  processes  or  qualities  necessary 
for  its  results;  for  if  a  force  have  the  capacity  of  driving  an  object  con- 
quered by  it  a  hundred  braccia,  and  this  object  while  obeying  it  meets 
with  some  obstacle,  Thou  hast  ordained  that  the  force  of  the  impact 
will  cause  a  new  movement  which  by  divers  rebounds  will  recover  the 
entire  amount  of  the  distance  it  should  have  traversed. 

And  if  you  were  to  measure  the  track  made  by  these  bounds  you 
will  discover  it  to  be  of  the  same  length  as  it  would  be  if  a  similar  ob- 
ject were  impelled  freely  through  the  air  by  the  same  force. 

You  may  make  an  experiment  of  this  with  a  small  glass  ball  as  it 
strikes  upon  a  surface  of  smooth  polished  stone.  Take  a  long  staff  and 
mark  it  with  different  colours  from  end  to  end,  and  then  give  it  some- 
one to  hold,  and  set  yourself  at  some  distance  away  [to  watch]  the  re- 
bounds [and  see]  against  the  height  of  the  staff  to  what  colours  the  ball 
rises  successively  with  each  rebound,  and  make  a  note  of  them.  If 
there  are  as  many  observers  as  the  number  of  times  the  ball  rebounds 
each  will  keep  it  more  easily  in  memory.  But  either  have  the  staff  fixed 
at  the  top  or  with  the  end  in  a  hole,  for  if  anyone  held  it  with  his  hand 
he  would  interrupt  the  line  of  sight  of  the  judge.  Arrange  that  the  first 
bound  be  made  between  two  right  angles  so  that  the  ball  may  always 
fall  in  the  same  spot,  because  then  the  height  of  the  rebounds  against 
the  staff  may  be  more  accurately  discerned. 

Then  have  this  ball  discharged  by  the  same  power  in  free  course  and 
make  a  note  of  the  spot  where  it  strikes;  and  measure  it  and  you  will 
find  that  the  length  of  the  second  course  is  identical  with  the  first. 

a  24  r. 

If  you  should  be  in  a  boat,  and  you  there  exert  your  utmost  force, 
the  boat  will  never  stir  from  its  position  unless  the  said  force  has  a 
greater  obstacle  outside  this  boat  than  that  made  within  it. 

Again  if  you  are  all  huddled  up  in  a  sack  and  within  it  make  efforts 


52o  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

to  move  yourself  you  will  find  it  impossible  to  change  your  position, 
but  if  you  draw  a  foot  out  of  the  sack  and  use  it  as  a  lever  on  the 
ground  putting  your  head  to  the  bottom  of  the  sack  you  will  be  able 
to  draw  it  ofT  backwards. 

The  flame  also  does  the  same  with  its  desire  to  multiply  and  extend 
itself  in  the  bombard,  for  while  it  is  entirely  inside  it  the  bombard  does 
not  recoil.  But  when  this  flame  strikes  and  pushes  the  resisting  air  while 
remaining  united  to  that  which  pushes  on  the  bottom,  it  is  the  cause  of 
the  bombard  recoiling;  for  that  portion  of  the  flame  that  strikes,  not 
being  able  to  find  in  the  air  that  instant  passage  that  it  requires,  throws 
its  force  upon  the  opposite  side.  a  28  r. 

WHAT  IS  FORCE? 

Force  I  define  as  an  incorporeal  agency,  an  invisible  power,  which  by 
means  of  unforeseen  external  pressure  is  caused  by  the  movement 
stored  up  and  diffused  within  bodies  which  are  withheld  and  turned 
aside  from  their  natural  uses;  imparting  to  these  an  active  life  of 
marvellous  power  it  constrains  all  created  things  to  change  of  form  and 
position,  and  hastens  furiously  to  its  desired  death,  changing  as  it  goes 
according  to  circumstances.  When  it  is  slow  its  strength  is  increased, 
and  speed  enfeebles  it.  It  is  born  in  violence  and  dies  in  liberty;  and 
the  greater  it  is  the  more  quickly  it  is  consumed.  It  drives  away  in  fury 
whatever  opposes  its  destruction.  It  desires  to  conquer  and  slay  the 
cause  of  opposition,  and  in  conquering  destroys  itself.  It  waxes  more 
powerful  where  it  finds  the  greater  obstacle.  Everything  instinctively 
flees  from  death.  Everything  when  under  constraint  itself  constrains 
other  things.  Without  force  nothing  moves. 

The  body  in  which  it  is  born  neither  grows  in  weight  nor  in  form. 
None  of  the  movements  that  it  makes  are  lasting. 

It  increases  by  effort  and  disappears  when  at  rest.  The  body  within 
which  it  is  confined  is  deprived  of  liberty.  Often  also  by  its  movement 
it  generates  new  force.  a  34  v. 

Every  weight  desires  to  descend  to  the  centre  by  the  shortest  way; 
and  where  there  is  the  greater  weight  there  there  is  the  greater  de- 
sire, and  that  thing  which  weighs  the  most  if  it  is  left  free  falls  mosr 


MOVEMENT   AND   WEIGHT  521 

rapidly.  The  less  the  slant  ot  the  opposing  substance  the  greater  its  re- 
sistance. But  the  weight  passes  by  nature  into  all  that  supports  it,  and 
thus  penetrating  from  support  to  support  it  grows  heavier  as  it  passes 
from  body  to  body  until  it  realises  its  desire.  Necessity  draws  it  and 
abundance  drives  it  away.  It  is  all  in  all  its  vertical  opposition  and  all 
in  each  of  its  degrees.  And  that  opposition  which  slants  the  most  will 
not  ofler  resistance  to  its  descent,  but,  being  free,  will  fall  together 
with  it.  In  its  function  of  pressing  and  making  heavy  it  is  like  force. 
Weight  is  subdued  by  force,  as  force  is  by  weight.  One  can  see  weight 
without  force,  but  one  cannot  see  force  without  weight.  If  weight  has 
no  neighbour  it  seeks  one  with  fury  and  force  drives  it  away  with 
fury.  If  weight  desires  an  unchangeable  position  force  readily  flies  from 
it.  If  weight  desires  stability  and  force  is  always  desirous  of  flight, 
weight  of  itself  is  without  fatigue,  while  force  is  never  exempt  from  it. 
The  more  weight  falls  the  more  it  increases  and  the  more  force  falls 
the  more  it  diminishes.  If  one  is  eternal,  the  other  is  mortal.  Weight  is 
natural  and  force  is  accidental.  Weight  desires  stability  and  perma- 
nence, and  force  desires  flight  and  death  of  itself.  Weight,  force  and  a 
blow  resemble  each  other  in  respect  of  pressure.  a  35  r. 

In  the  centre  of  the  direct  path  taken  by  heavy  bodies  which  traverse 
the  air  with  violent  movement,  there  is  greater  power  and  greater  strik- 
ing force  when  an  obstacle  is  met  with  than  in  any  other  part  of  its 
line. 

The  reason  of  this  is  that  when  the  weight  parts  from  the  force  of  its 
mover,  although  this  separation  is  in  the  initial  stage  of  its  power,  it 
finds  nevertheless  the  air  without  movement,  and  finds  it  in  the  initial 
stage  of  its  resistance,  and  although  the  sum  total  of  the  resistance  of 
the  air  is  greater  than  the  power  of  the  weight  which  is  pushed  upon  it, 
nevertheless  as  it  strikes  only  a  small  part  it  succeeds  in  remaining  the 
conqueror.  Consequently  it  drives  it  from  its  place  and  in  so  driving  it 
it  somewhat  impedes  its  own  velocity.  This  air  therefore  after  having 
been  pushed  pushes  and  drives  the  other,  and  generates  revolving 
movements  in  its  wake,  of  which  the  weight  that  is  moved  within  it  is 
always  the  centre,  after  the  fashion  of  circles  formed  in  the  water, 
which  have  their  centre  at  the  spot  struck  by  the  stone.  And  so  as  the 
one  circle  drives  the  other,  the  whole  air  that  is  along  the  line  in  front 


522  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

of  its  mover  becomes  prepared  for  movement,  and  this  increases  in  pro- 
portion as  the  weight  that  drives  it  presses  the  more.  In  consequence 
this  weight  finding  less  resistance  in  the  air  redoubles  the  speed  of  its 
course,  the  same  as  a  barge  drawn  through  the  water,  which  moves 
with  difficulty  at  the  beginning  of  the  movement  although  the  force  of 
its  mover  may  be  at  its  maximum,  but  as  with  arched  waves  this  water 
commences  to  take  its  movement  the  barge  in  following  this  movement 
meets  only  with  slight  resistance  and  therefore  moves  with  greater  ease. 
The  bullet  likewise  finding  but  slight  resistance  follows  the  course  it 
has  begun  until  the  point  at  which  abandoned  in  part  by  its  first  force 
it  commences  to  grow  weak  and  to  drop,  and  as  its  course  changes  the 
way  already  prepared  for  its  flight  by  the  fleeting  air  contains  it  no 
longer;  the  more  it  drops  however  the  more  it  finds  fresh  resistance  in 
the  air  and  the  more  it  delays,  up  to  the  point  at  which  resuming  its 
natural  movement  it  acquires  fresh  speed,  and  even  so  the  barge  as  it 
turns  delays  its  course.  Now  therefore  I  conclude  according  to  what  is 
demonstrated  in  the  eighth  proposition  that  that  part  of  the  movement 
which  occurs  between  the  first  resistance  of  the  air  and  the  beginning 
of  its  drop  is  of  the  greater  power,  and  it  is  the  centre  of  the  course 
made  in  the  air  in  a  straight  direct  line.  a  43  v. 

OF  THE  BLOW  AND  THE  DISPLACEMENT  CAUSED  BY 
WEIGHT  OR  BY  FORCE 

I  maintain  that  the  displacement  caused  by  the  weight  which  falls 
is  equal  to  the  displacement  caused  by  the  force. 

The  body  that  receives  the  blow  is  not  injured  in  the  part  opposite 
as  it  is  in  the  part  which  is  struck.  The  proof  of  this  is  shown  when  a 
stone  is  struck  while  lying  in  a  man's  hands,  for  the  hand  is  not  in- 
jured when  it  is  holding  the  stone  that  is  struck  as  much  as  it  would  be 
injured  if  it  actually  received  the  blow.  a  53  v. 

DEFINITION  OF  FORCE  AND  MOVEMENT  IN  ANIMALS 

I  affirm  that  the  said  movement  is  based  upon  several  points  of 
support. 
Force  is  produced  by  the  lessening  and  contraction  of  the  muscles 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  523 

which  draw  hack,  and  of  the  nerves  which  stretch  as  far  as  the  sensa- 
tion communicated  by  the  empty  cords  dictates.  b  3  v. 

OF  THE  NATURE  OF  MOVEMENT 

If  a  wheel  of  which  the  movement  has  become  very  rapid  continues 
to  make  many  revolutions  after  its  motive  power  has  abandoned  it, 
then  if  this  motive  power  continues  to  cause  it  to  turn  with  the  same 
quickness  of  movement,  it  would  seem  that  this  continuance  necessi- 
tates but  little  force. 

And  I  conclude  that  in  order  to  maintain  this  movement  only  a 
slight  effort  by  the  motive  power  would  be  needed,  and  so  much  more 
as  by  nature  it  tends  to  become  fixed.  b  26  v. 

CONCERNING  WEIGHTS 

I  ask  if  a  weight  of  a  pound  falling  two  braccia  bury  itself  in  the 
earth  the  depth  of  a  hand  how  deeply  will  it  bury  itself  if  it  falls  forty 
braccia,  and  how  far  a  weight  of  two  pounds  will  bury  itself  if  it  falls 
two  braccia? 

One  may  ask  also  if  the  size  of  this  weight  be  represented  by  a 
quantity  a  and  then  this  quantity  be  doubled,  its  weight  remaining  the 
same  and  falling  from  the  same  height,  how  much  greater  impress  the 
lesser  bulk  will  make  than  the  greater  if  the  ground  offer  equal  re- 
sistance? b  61  r. 


EXAMPLE  OF  THE  BLOW  AND  OF  THE  DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN  WEIGHT  AND  FORCE 

The  blow  since  it  is  of  very  short  and  even  of  indivisible  life  pro- 
duces suddenly  its  full  and  quick  effect  upon  what  is  opposed  to  it,  and 
this  effect  ends  before  it  reaches  the  base  of  the  thing  struck.  For  this 
reason  therefore  you  will  find  more  enlargement  at  the  summit  of  the 
thing  struck  than  at  its  base.  And  if  you  wish  to  ascertain  how  much 
greater  the  power  of  the  blow  is  upon  the  thing  struck  at  its  summit 
than  at  its  base*  calculate  how  many  times  the  circumference  of  the 
base  m  n  will  go  into  that  of  the  summit  a  c;  as  many  times  as  m  n 


524  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

goes  into  a  c  so  many  times  will  a  c  receive  into  itself  greater  force  than 
m  n.  But  if  this  support  a  m  is  pressed  down  by  weight  or  by  force, 
m  n  will  be  as  much  enlarged  as  a  c,  because  their  powers  move  more 
slowly  than  that  of  the  blow.  c  6  v. 


The  Blow 

Since  the  blow  is  more  swift  than  the  movement,  the  thing  touched 
by  the  blow  although  it  may  be  in  movement  will  rather  obey  the  effect 
of  this  blow  than  that  which  accelerates  the  movement.  c  7  r. 

If  two  make  the  same  journey  in  the  same  time  he  who  runs  often, 
with  frequent  intervals  for  rest,  will  undergo  as  much  fatigue  as  he 
who  goes  gently  and  continuously.  c  7  v. 


Percussion 

If  two  balls  strike  together  at  a  right  angle  one  will  deviate  more 
from  its  first  course  than  the  other  in  proportion  as  it  is  less  than  the 
other.  c  15  r. 

The  part  of  a  log  first  severed  from  the  end  of  it  by  the  stroke  of  the 
axe  flies  off  to  a  greater  distance  than  any  other  part  carried  away  by 
the  same  blow. 

This  is  because  the  part  of  the  log  that  first  receives  the  blow  receives 
it  in  the  first  stage  of  its  power  and  consequently  goes  farther.  The 
second  part  flies  a  less  distance  because  the  fury  of  the  blow  has  already 
subsided,  the  third  still  less  and  so  also  the  fourth. 

The  wood  which  is  divided  from  the  rest  by  the  stroke  of  the  axe 
will  fly  oflf  with  greater  violence  at  one  time  than  at  another  as  the 
stroke  is  more  powerful  at  one  time  than  another,  and  the  piece  will 
fly  of?  to  a  greater  distance.  This  is  because  as  the  blow  is  the  most 
powerful  and  instant  thing  that  a  man  can  do,  as  is  shown  in  the  fourth 
proposition  which  treats  of  the  nature  of  the  blow,  when  the  axe, 
driven  by  man's  strength  and  by  the  movement  of  the  hands  in  falling, 
from  the  weight  and  blow  of  the  hatchet  has  entered  within  the  surface 
of  the  close-grained  wood,  so  soon  as  this  fine  edge  has  entered  imme- 
diately the  thick  part  of  the  hatchet  follows  and  proceeds  with  such 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  525 

vigour  and  swiftness  to  widen  and  enlarge  the  edges  of  the  cut  that 
it  pulls  it  asunder  with  great  force,  and  the  quicker  it  is  the  more  the 
cut  will  be  enlarged  and  deepened,  and  if  (part)  is  entirely  severed  it 
flies  from  the  blow  with  great  swiftness,  as  may  be  shown  by  experi- 
ment. 

Water  air  and  fire  produce  the  same  effect  in  their  rebound  from 
objects  that  oppose  their  course: 

A  piece  of  wood  separated  from  the  rest  by  the  blow  of  an  axe  will 
fly  of?  from  it  at  an  equal  angle  to  that  of  the  blow. 

Everything  of  a  compact  surface  that  falls  upon  a  resisting  object 
will  have  the  line  of  its  rebound  at  the  same  angle  as  the  line  of  its 
incidence.  c  22  v. 

Movement  and  percussion 

Among  bodies  of  equal  movement  and  size  that  which  is  of  greater 
weight  will  give  a  greater  blow  to  the  thing  that  opposes  its  course, 
and  since  turbid  water  is  heavier  than  clear,  the  blow  which  it  gives 
upon  the  thing  that  opposes  its  course  will  be  greater. 


Movement  of  water 

A  body  with  a  thicker  harder  surface  will  cause  the  objects  that 
strike  against  it  to  separate  from  it  with  a  more  powerful  and  rapid 
rebound. 

Water 

Water  that  falls  upon  gravel  mixed  with  sand  and  earth  will  hollow 
it  out  more  deeply  and  more  rapidly  for  the  aforesaid  cause  than  if  it 
fell  upon  plain  soft  mud,  for  as  it  falls  upon  gravel  it  takes  a  swift 
powerful  leap  and  gnaws  away  more  of  what  first  opposes  its  bound 
and  rises  more. 

The  angle  caused  by  the  percussion  of  equal  spherical  bodies  is  al- 
ways equal  to  that  of  the  rebound.  c  28  r. 

Every  weight  tends  to  fall  towards  the  centre  by  the  shortest  way.

526  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

OF  HUMAN  MOVEMENT 

When  you  wish  to  represent  a  man  in  the  act  of  moving  some  weight 
reflect  that  these  movements  would  be  made  in  different  directions, 
that  is  in  the  case  of  simple  movement  from  below  upwards,  as  that 
which  a  man  makes  when  he  stoops  to  lift  a  weight  with  the  intention 
of  raising  it  as  he  straightens  himself;  or  when  he  wishes  to  pull  some- 
thing backward  or  push  it  forward  or  draw  it  down  with  a  cord  that 
passes  over  a  pulley.  Here  one  should  remember  that  a  man's  weight 
drags  in  proportion  as  the  centre  of  his  gravity  is  distant  from  that  of 
his  support,  and  to  this  must  be  added  the  force  exerted  by  his  legs  and 
bent  spine  as  he  straightens  himself.  e  15  r. 

The  mover  is  always  more  powerful  than  the  thing  moved. 

e  20  v. 

Of  the  knowledge  of  the  weights  proportioned  to  the  forces  of  their 
movers : 

The  force  of  the  mover  ought  always  to  be  in  proportion  to  the 
weight  of  its  movable  thing  and  to  the  resistance  of  the  medium  in 
which  the  weight  moves.  But  one  cannot  deduce  the  law  of  this  action 
unless  one  first  gives  the  quantity  of  the  condensation  of  the  air  when 
struck  by  any  movable  thing  whatever;  and  this  condensation  will  be 
of  greater  or  less  density  according  to  the  greater  or  less  speed  of  the 
mobile  thing  pressing  on  it,  as  is  shown  in  the  flight  of  birds,  for  the 
sound  that  they  make  with  their  wings  in  beating  the  air  is  deeper  or 
more  shrill  according  to  whether  the  movement  of  the  wings  is  slower 
or  swifter.  e  28  v. 

The  weight  of  every  heavy  thing  suspended  is  all  in  the  whole 
length  of  the  cord  that  supports  it  and  all  in  each  part  of  it.      e  32  v. 

OF  COMPOUND  IMPETUS 

Compound  impetus  is  the  name  given  to  that  which  participates  in 
the  impetus  of  the  mover  and  the  impetus  of  the  thing  moved,  as  is  the 
movement  /  h  c  which  is  between  two  simple  movements  one  of  which 
is  near  the  beginning  of  the  movement  and  the  other  near  the  end:  a  g 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  527 

is  the  first  and  d  e  c  is  at  the  end.  But  the  first  only  obeys  the  mover 
and  the  last  is  only  of  the  semblance  of  the  thing  moved. 

OF  IRREGULAR  IMPETUS 

The  irregular  fdechonpossto]  impetus  accompanies  the  thing  moved 
with  three  kinds  of  impetus,  of  which  two  spring  from  the  mover  and 
the  third  from  the  thing  moved.  The  two  that  originate  in  the  mover 
are  the  straight  movement  of  the  mover  mingled  with  the  curved  move- 
ment of  the  thing  moved,  and  the  third  is  the  simple  movement  of  the 
thing  moved  which  tends  merely  to  turn  in  the  middle  of  its  con- 
vexity at  contact  with  the  plane  where  it  turns  and  lays  itself  down. 

FRICTION 

Friction  is  divided  into  three  parts:  these  are  simple,  compound  and 
disordered. 

Simple  friction  is  that  made  by  the  thing  moved  upon  the  place 
where  it  is  dragged.  Compound  is  that  which  the  thing  moved  makes 
between  two  immovable  things.  Irregular  is  that  made  by  corners  of 
different  sides.  e  35  r. 

OF  THE  WEIGHT  DISTRIBUTED  OVER  THE  LENGTH  OF  THE 
CORD  WHICH  SUPPORTS  IT 

The  weight  distributed  over  the  whole  length  of  the  cord  which  sup- 
ports it  will  give  less  strain  to  this  cord  than  if  it  was  suspended  to  its 
lowest  part,  and  this  is  proved  by  one  of  the  Elements  which  says 
'Among  cords  of  equal  thickness  the  longest  is  the  least  strong'. 

Consequently  the  cord  a  b  which  supports  the  weight  distributed 
over  all  the  remainder  of  the  cord  b  t  is  so  much  stronger  than  the 
opposite  part  of  the  cord  a  c  as  it  is  shorter. 

One  cord  supports  as  many  times  the  weight  of  another  as  the  num- 
ber of  the  curves  is  greater  in  the  one  than  the  other. 

The  division  made  by  the  cord  with  its  pulley  is  never  rectangular; 
this  is  proved  from  the  two  simple  cords  that  hang  from  the  same  pul- 
ley which  would  meet  at  the  centre  of  the  earth.

DIVISION  OF  WEIGHT 

There  are  three  conditions  of  gravity,  of  which  the  one  is  its  simple 
natural  gravity,  the  second  is  its  accidental  gravity,  the  third  the  fric- 
tion produced  by  it.  But  the  natural  weight  is  in  itself  unchangeable, 
the  accidental  which  is  joined  to  it  is  of  infinite  force,  and  the  friction 
varies  according  to  the  places  wherein  it  occurs,  namely  rough  or 
smooth  places.  e  54  v. 

DEFINITION  OF  COMPOUND  BALANCES 

We  may  define  the  nature  of  compound  balances  both  as  regards 
circular  balances  that  is  to  say  pulleys  and  wheels  and  also  rectilinear 
balances.  But  first  I  will  make  some  experiment  before  proceeding 
farther  because  it  is  my  intention  first  to  cite  experience  then  to  show 
by  reasoning  why  this  experience  is  constrained  to  act  in  this  manner. 
And  this  is  the  rule  according  to  which  speculators  as  to  natural  effects 
have  to  proceed.  And  although  nature  commences  with  reason  and 
ends  in  experience  it  is  necessary  for  us  to  do  the  opposite,  that  is  to 
commence  as  I  said  before  with  experience  and  from  this  to  proceed  to 
investigate  the  reason. 

I  see  that  it  is  necessary  in  the  compound  rectilinear  balance  in  the 
second  demonstration  that  as  much  as  the  one  of  the  extremities  de- 
scends so  much  the  opposite  extremity  rises,  and  the  cause  of  this  is  the 
equality  of  their  arms.  e  55  r. 

OF  GRAVITY  AND  ITS  SUPPORTS 

Gravity  suspended  or  supported  is  all  in  all  its  support  and  all  in 
each  of  its  parts. 

The  cord  bent  over  its  pulley  supports  more  weight  in  its  pendent 
extremities  than  when  it  is  stretched  out  in  a  continuous  straight  line. 
This  may  be  proved  thus:  suppose  the  cord  bent  over  the  said  pulley  to 
be  d  c  e  f  and  the  ultimate  strength  of  its  resistance  to  be  represented 
by  10;  I  affirm  that  if  the  same  cord  be  stretched  straight  as  is  shown  at 
a  b  it  will  not  support  more  than  five. 

And  this  proceeds  from  the  seventh  of  this  where  it  is  stated:  'Each 


MOVEMENT   AND  WEIGHT  529 

cord  gains  as  much  in  strength  as  it  loses  in  length;  consequently  the 
cords  c  d  and  e  f  in  order  each  to  have  their  length  double  that  of  the 
cord  a  b  must  necessarily  have  double  the  strength  of  the  cord  a  b? 

WHAT  PART  OF  THE  CURVED  CORD  IS  STRONGEST 

The  maximum  strength  of  the  curved  cord  is  in  the  middle  of  its 
bend:  this  is  proved  by  the  eighth  of  this  which  says  'That  cord  is 
strongest  which  is  thickest'.  It  follows  that  as  the  cord  is  compressed  in 
its  fold  over  the  pulley  where  it  is  bent  it  becomes  widened  and  lowers 
itself  a  little,  and  for  this  cause  necessity  constrains  it  to  become  thus 
compressed.  e  55  v. 

OF  MOVEMENT  MADE  BY  A  HEAVY  SUBSTANCE 

Every  heavy  substance  moves  on  that  side  on  which  it  weighs  most. 

And  the  movement  of  the  heavy  substance  is  made  on  that  side 
where  it  encounters  least  resistance. 

The  heaviest  part  of  bodies  that  move  in  the  air  becomes  the  guide 
of  their  movements. 

That  heavy  substance  is  of  more  slow  descent  in  the  air  which  falls 
in  greater  width. 

It  follows  that  that  heavy  substance  will  have  the  swiftest  descent 
which  confines  itself  within  the  least  width. 

The  free  descent  of  every  heavy  substance  is  made  along  the  line  of 
its  greatest  diameter. 

That  heavy  substance  will  be  swiftest  in  movement  which  reduces 
itself  to  the  smallest  bulk. 

The  descent  of  a  heavy  substance  is  as  much  slower  as  it  extends  in 
greater  breadth.  e  57  r. 

WHY  A  BALANCE  FORMED  OF  BEAM  AND  EQUAL  WEIGHTS 
STOPS  IN  A  STATE  OF  EQUILIBRIUM 

Every  liquid  heavy  substance  settles  down  with  its  opposite  extremi- 
ties in  a  state  of  equilibrium  when  it  is  of  natural  uniform  weight. 
And  it  is  lowered  as  much  on  one  side  as  it  is  raised  on  the  other  and 


530  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

acts  round  its  centre,  as  one  sees  with  the  extremities  of  the  balance 
round  its  axis  with  their  oscillations  upwards  and  downwards  until  the 
impetus  is  consumed;  and  this  is  brought  about  solely  through  the  in- 
equality of  the  opposite  sides  round  the  centre  of  the  water  or  of  the 
balance.  e  57  v. 

[Gravity  and  movement.  Balances] 

By  what  is  said  below  the  balance  does  not  have  all  its  natural  weight 
upon  the  centre  of  its  revolution,  but  it  has  as  much  less  as  the  weight 
that  moves  the  upper  arm  has  the  more  slanting  movement,  as  is 
proved  in  this  discourse. 

The  heavy  substance  in  suspension  is  all  in  all  and  all  in  every  part 
of  the  centre  line  of  its  support. 

The  staff  placed  slantwise  has  two  kinds  of  gravity  of  which  one 
weighs  slantwise  between  the  centre  of  the  earth  and  the  horizon.  The 
other  weighs  vertically  upon  the  centre  of  the  earth.  And  of  these  one 
is  accidental  and  the  other  natural.  And  this  occurs  where  the  mathe- 
matical centre  is  not  the  centre  of  the  revolution  of  the  balance.  This  is 
proved  thus,  let  a  b  c  d  be  the  balance  and  s  its  mathematical  centre; 
the  centre  of  the  revolution  will  be  /.  I  affirm  that  when  the  balance 
is  in  such  a  position  the  mathematical  centre  s  is  the  same  in  the  line 
that  points  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth,  that  is  g  h,  as  the  centre  of 
the  revolution  /,  and  this  line  g  h  divides  the  staff  of  the  balance  into 
two  equal  and  similar  parts  namely  the  part  a  b  e  f  and  the  part  c  d  e  f. 
Whether  one  wishes  to  rest  the  balance  upon  the  point  s  or  the  point  / 
is  immaterial  for  both  the  one  point  and  the  other  are  in  the  central  line 
g  h  which  divides  the  weight  equally. 

There  still  remains  the  above-mentioned  slanting  weight  which  is 
above  the  centre  of  the  revolution  /,  that  is  the  weight  which  is  above 
the  line  n  o  that  is  a  b  r  /,  to  which  the  counter  weight  c  d  r  f  offers  no 
resistance  in  the  above-mentioned  slanting  movement.  e  58  r. 


OF  THE  MOVER  OR  THE  MOVABLE  THING 

The  power  of  the  mover  is  always  greater  than  the  resistance  of  the 
thing  moved. 


MOVEMENT   AND   WEIGHT  531 

OF  LEVER  AND  COUNTERLEY1.R 

There  is  added  as  much  accidental  weight  to  the  mover  placed  at  the 
extremity  of  the  lever  as  the  movable  thing  placed  at  the  extremity  of 
the  counterlever  exceeds  it  in  natural  weight. 

And  the  movement  of  the  mover  is  as  much  greater  than  that  of  the 
thing  moved  as  the  accidental  weight  of  this  mover  exceeds  its  natural 
weight. 

This  may  be  proved;  for  let  us  say  that  the  movement  of  the  mover 
is  from  b  to  d  and  of  the  thing  moved  from  a  to  c\  I  maintain  that  the 
movement  b  d  will  be  as  much  greater  than  the  movement  a  c  as  the 
accidental  weight  of  b  exceeds  the  [natural]  weight  b;  and  as  this  ex- 
ceeds it  by  one,  the  natural  weight  therefore  also  ...  e  58  v. 

OF  WEIGHTS 

A  balance  of  equal  arms  and  weights  when  removed  from  a  position 
of  equality  will  have  its  arms  and  bows  unequal  because  it  changes 
the  mathematical  centre,  and  consequently  necessity  constrains  it  to  re- 
gain the  lost  equality  of  arms  and  weight.  This  is  proved  by  the  second 
passage. 

Transcript  of  the  above 

A  balance  with  equal  arms  and  weights  removed  from  a  position 
of  equality  will  make  arms  and  weights  unequal,  and  consequently 
necessity  constrains  it  to  regain  the  lost  equality  of  arms  and  weights. 
This  is  proved  by  the  second  of  this,  and  it  is  proved  because  the  higher 
weight  is  more  removed  from  the  centre  of  the  revolution  than  the 
lower  weight,  and  consequently  having  a  more  feeble  support  it  de- 
scends more  easily  and  lifts  up  the  opposite  side  of  the  weight  joined 
to  the  extremity  of  the  lesser  arm. 

OF  ACCIDENTAL  AS  AGAINST  NATURAL  WEIGHT 

The  accidental  weight  set  in  the  balance  against  the  natural  weight 
is  worth  as  much  as  this  natural  weight,  and  this  is  proved  by  means 
of  the  weight  that  the  pole  of  the  balance  receives  from  it,  for  it  loads 


532  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

itself  so  much  more  with  the  accidental  than  the  natural  weight  in 
proportion  as  the  greater  arm  of  this  balance  exceeds  the  smaller  in 
length.  e  59  r. 


THE   COMMENCEMENT   OF   THIS    BOOK   CONCERNING 

WEIGHTS 

First.  If  the  weights,  arms  and  movements  slant  equally  these 
weights  will  not  move  each  other. 

Second.  If  the  weights  equal  in  slant,  and  equal,  move  each  other 
the  arms  of  the  balance  will  be  unequal;  for  'Equal  weights  maintain 
equal  gravity  in  an  equal  slant'. 

Fourth.  If  the  weights  and  the  arms  of  the  balance  with  the  slant  of 
the  movements  of  these  weights  are  equal,  then  these  weights  will  show 
themselves  unequal  if  their  appendices  have  their  slants  unequal. 

Third.  But  if  the  equal  weights  in  the  arm  and  the  balance  move 
one  another  then  the  movements  of  the  weights  will  be  of  unequal 
slant. 

First.  Why  it  is  a  definition.  The  cord  that  hangs  from  the  opposite 
sides  of  the  pulley  or  beam  where  it  rests,  is  always  divided  and  joined 
in  rectangular  division  and  union  by  the  opposite  ends  of  the  half 
diameters  of  this  pulley  or  beam  or  other  round  instrument,  no  matter 
what  the  slant  of  the  cords  may  be.  e  59  v. 

WEIGHT  AND  FORCE 

The  potential  lever  will  never  be  consumed  by  any  power. 

This  is  proved  by  the  first  which  says: — 'Every  continuous  quantity 
is  divisible  to  infinity'.  But  that  which  is  divisible  in  act  is  also  divisible 
in  power :  but  it  is  not  the  case  that  that  which  is  divisible  in  power  is 
divisible  in  act.  And  if  the  divisions  made  potentially  towards  the  in- 
finite change  the  substance  of  the  matter  divided,  these  divisions  will 
return  to  the  composition  of  their  whole,  the  parts  reuniting  in  the  same 
stages  in  which  they  were  divided.  For  example  let  us  take  ice  and 
divide  it  towards  infinity;  it  will  become  changed  into  water,  and  from 
water  into  air,  and  from  air  into  fire1',  and  if  the  air  should  come  to

thicken  again  it  will  change  itself  into  water,  and  from  water  into  hail, 
etc.  E  60  r. 

A  cord  of  any  thickness  or  strength  whatever  placed  in  a  level  posi- 
tion as  regards  its  opposite  extremities  will  never  be  able  to  straighten 
itself  if  it  has  any  weight  placed  in  the  centre  of  its  length. 

OF  THE  RESISTANCE  OF  THE  ARCHED  CORD 

Given  the  straight  cord  suspended  by  one  of  its  ends  which  breaks 
itself  exactly  where  it  is  fastened  by  its  own  weight,  one  asks  what 
weight  it  will  support  in  any  arch  that  may  be  made  of  this  cord,  this 
arch  having  its  extremities  in  the  position  of  equality. 

Where  the  potential  lever  is  in  existence  the  force  will  also  be  in 
existence. 

The  force  will  be  of  so  much  the  greater  excellence  as  the  potential 
lever  is  less  in  quantity. 

The  force  is  always  created  at  the  same  time  as  the  potential  lever 
and  so  it  dies  when  this  lever  fails.  e  60  v. 

OF  GRAVITY  AND  ITS  ORDER 

[Levers  real  and  potential] 

It  is  necessary  first  to  describe  the  real  powers  in  whatever  aspect, 
second  the  semi-real  powers,  third  the  potential  virtue.  Next  define  how 
the  centre  of  the  circumvolution  is  that  which  divides  the  power  of  the 
lever  from  the  power  of  its  counterlever. 

And  the  movements  of  the  lever  and  of  its  counterlever  are  always 
contrary  in  their  movement  of  circumvolution  round  the  above-men- 
tioned centre.  And  all  the  powers  joined  to  the  lever  and  counterlever 
are  always  in  rectangular  conjunction  with  this  lever  both  real  and  po- 
tential. And  this  angle  has  always  one  of  its  sides  which  proceeds  from 
the  centre  of  the  circumvolution,  and  the  real  arms  of  the  balance  will 
never  contain  within  themselves  the  potential  arms  unless  they  are  in  a 
position  of  equality.  And  always  the  junction  of  the  real  or  potential  ap- 
pendix with  the  arm  of  the  balance  is  the  nearest  part  of  this  appendix. 

The  first  direction  taken  by  the  appendix  after  its  junction  with  the 


534  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

arm  of  the  balance  shows  the  direction  of  the  potential  appendix  which 
in  rectangular  conjunction  meets  the  extremity  of  the  potential  lever. 

e  65  v. 

Always  the  cords  folded  in  an  angle  in  which  the  heavy  substance  is 
supported  joined  to  the  ring  will  bear  equally  the  burden  of  this  weight 
at  their  extremities,  and  this  comes  from  the  fact  that  the  cord  is  of 
uniform  slant. 

The  cords  which  with  equal  slant  meet  at  the  point  of  suspension  of 
a  heavy  substance  always  support  equally  the  weight  of  this  substance. 

If  two  cords  converging  or  diverging  descend  to  a  suspended  beam 
situated  at  any  angle  and  are  joined  to  it  in  any  part  of  its  length,  so 
that  the  centre  of  the  beam  is  placed  between  them,  when  these  parts 
find  themselves  in  these  conditions  the  centre  of  gravity  of  the  beam 
will  be  in  the  intercentric  line  which  passes  through  this  beam. 

OF  GRAVITY 

It  is  impossible  that  the  power  of  any  motive  force  should  be  able  at 
the  same  time  and  with  the  same  movement  to  create  a  power  greater 
than  itself.  This  is  proved  by  the  third  of  this  which  says: — Towers 
which  are  equal  to  each  other  do  not  overcome  each  other',     e  66  r. 

If  two  cords  descend  with  different  lengths  and  with  their  slants  con- 
verging or  diverging  to  the  point  of  suspension  of  the  extremities  of  the 
beam,  then  if  this  beam  be  equijacent  the  slants  of  the  two  aforesaid 
cords  will  be  equal  one  to  the  other.  e  66  v. 

What  is  gravity  and  whether  it  is  natural  or  accidental,  and  one  may 
ask  the  same  concerning  levity: 

The  answer  is  that  both  are  accidental  powers  because  each  always 
waits  for  its  destruction  and  one  is  never  born  without  the  other  or  dies 
without  the  other.  This  is  proved  by  the  air  which  forms  in  the  shape 
of  a  bubble  or  bladder  at  the  bottom  of  the  water,  where  the  fact  of  its 
formation  immediately  creates  its  levity  and  creates  the  weight  of  the 
water  that  is  above  it.  And  as  soon  as  the  bubble  arrives  at  the  surface 
its  levity  dies  together  with  the  gravity  of  the  water  that  was  above  it. 

The  stone  that  descends  through  the  water  first  makes  the  water 


MOVEMENT  AND   WEIGHT  535 

heavy  that  closes  up  the  beginning  of  the  entrance  made  by  the  stone, 
and  makes  light  the  water  that  rises  to  fill  up  the  space  that  the  stone 
leaves  as  it  descends,  because  that  which  moves  upwards  is  light. 

Whether  the  space  of  the  water  penetrated  by  the  stone  is  filled  by 
water  descending  or  by  water  from  the  side  or  by  water  that  is  below.

[  Of  a  heavy  body] 

If  the  angle  that  is  formed  by  the  meeting  of  the  two  cords  that  sup- 
port a  weight  is  cut  by  the  intercentric  line  of  this  weight,  then  this 
angle  is  divided  into  two  other  angles,  and  as  these  are  divided  anew  by 
the  line  of  the  equality  two  triangles  are  then  produced,  and  these  will 
have  the  same  proportion  between  base  and  base  as  there  is  between 
angle  and  angle,  and  the  same  proportion  between  angle  and  angle  as 
there  is  between  triangle  and  triangle,  and  the  proportion  of  triangle  to 
triangle  is  the  same  as  that  of  gravity  to  gravity  [the  same  as  those]  in 
which  the  heavy  substance  is  divided  in  relation  to  the  two  cords  by 
which  it  is  suspended;  but  the  proportion  is  in  inverse  ratio  because  the 
greatest  weight  falls  on  the  cord  which  makes  itself  the  outer  side  of 
the  lesser  triangle. 

How  many  are  tiie  centres  of  a  heavy  body  which  is  not  uniform? 

There  are  three  centres  of  a  gravity  that  is  uniformly  irregular. 

Of  which  the  first  is  the  centre  of  the  natural  gravity,  the  second  is 
the  centre  of  the  accidental  gravity  and  the  third  is  the  centre  of  the 
magnitude  of  this  heavy  body. 

But  the  centre  of  the  natural  gravity  does  not  lie  within  the  position 
of  equilibrium  if  the  heavy  body  is  not  uniform  in  weight  and  of  suit- 
able shape,  such  as  the  spherical  or  parallel  body  or  others  like  these. 

e  68  v. 

OF  THE  THINGS  WHICH  DESCEND  IN  THE  AIR 

The  air  becomes  condensed  before  bodies  that  penetrate  it  swiftly, 
acquiring  so  much  more  or  less  density  as  the  speed  is  more  violent  or 
less. 

A  plank  that  is  uniform  in  breadth,  length,  depth  and  weight  will 
not  preserve  the  slanting  movement  with  which  it  started  through  the 
air  that  it  penetrates  for  a  long  space,  but  will  turn  back  and  then  again 
forward  and  so  end  its  descent  with  a  fluctuating  movement.  This 


536  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

springs  from  the  fact  that  the  uniform  natural  thickness  of  the  air  is 
destroyed  because  it  is  condensed  under  the  right  angle  of  the  surface 
which  strikes  the  air  and  cleaves  it  open.  But  on  the  opposite  face  of 
this  plank  it  does  the  contrary  in  that  it  becomes  rarefied,  and  as  a  con- 
sequence the  rarefied  air  is  of  less  resistance,  and  for  this  reason  this 
surface  shows  itself  heavier.  The  rarefaction  acquired  by  the  air  that  is 
behind  this  plank  is  much  greater  than  the  density  that  is  produced  in 
front  of  it.  It  may  be  proved  why  the  air  is  condensed : — the  air  is  con- 
densed before  the  bodies  that  penetrate  it  for  when  one  pushes  a  part 
one  does  not  push  the  whole  of  that  which  is  in  front.  This  is  demon- 
strated by  the  flooding  that  is  produced  before  the  prow  of  a  ship. 

e  70  v. 

[Of  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies  in  the  air] 

Conception 

The  air  becomes  as  much  more  rarefied  behind  the  movement  of  the 
movable  thing  as  it  becomes  denser  in  front  of  the  same  movable  thing. 

Why  the  slanting  descent  does  not  keep  its  straightness. 

The  straight  line  of  the  oblique  descent  made  by  bodies  of  uniform 
thickness  and  weight  in  air  of  equal  resistance  will  not  be  continued  by 
a  heavy  substance  that  descends.  And  this  is  due  to  the  fact  of  the  air 
being  pressed  by  the  surface  of  the  heavy  substance  that  is  penetrating 
it,  and  becoming  condensed  resisting  and  stopping  this  surface;  whence 
of  necessity  the  opposite  surface  of  this  heavy  substance  finding  itself  in 
rarefied  air  immediately  acquires  gravity  and  falls  with  more  speed 
than  that  which  is  retarded  by  the  thickness  of  the  air  condensed  by  it. 
And  for  this  reason  the  impetus  to  the  right  made  by  the  movable  thing 
is  turned  to  the  left,  preserving  its  slant,  up  to  the  point  at  which  the 
other  air  is  condensed  anew  beneath  it;  this  air  again  resists  and  again 
turns  the  left  slanting  descent  to  a  right  descent,  then  from  right  to  left 
and  from  left  to  right  until  the  point  at  which  the  movement  ends. 

The  descent  of  the  beam  placed  in  any  slanting  position  will  always 
be  made  by  a  straight  line.  This  is  proved  by  the  seventh  of  this  which 
says: — 'Heavy  substances  of  uniform  shape  and  weight  which  descend 
through  an  equal  medium  will  have  the  same  rate  of  speed'.  If  therefore 
a  beam  of  uniform  shape  and  weight  be  divided  into  equal  and  similar 


MOVEMENT  AND   WEIGHT  537 

parts  their  descent  will  be  of  equal  and  similar  speed,  and  what  the  part 
docs  the  whole  will  do. 

The  adversary  says  that  the  whole  beam  united  will  not  have  a  de- 
scent similar  to  the  descent  of  its  divided  parts  because  the  whole  gives 
the  whole  of  its  weight  slanting  to  the  lower  surface,  and  the  part  gives 
the  whole  of  its  weight  to  the  surface  of  the  part  and  there  is  such 
speed  from  surface  to  surface  as  there  is  from  the  whole  to  the  part. 

E73  r. 

OF  BODIES  NOT  UNIFORM  IN  SHAPE 

Of  heavy  substances  not  uniform  in  shape  the  heavier  part  will  al- 
ways become  the  guide  of  their  descent  through  the  air. 

With  beams  of  uniform  shape  at  the  end  of  the  movement  the  mov- 
able thing  will  have  always  preserved  the  same  slanting  position  that  it 
had  at  the  beginning  of  the  movement. 

This  is  proved  by  means  of  the  beam  suspended  on  the  balance  n  m. 

The  heavy  substance  weighs  so  much  less  in  the  air  as  its  movement 
is  more  slanting. 

And  the  straight  descent  of  the  beam  weighs  as  much  less  in  the  air 
as  this  beam  is  less  slanting.  e  73  v. 

OF  THINGS  THAT  DESCEND  IN  THE  AIR 

A  heavy  substance  of  uniform  thickness  and  weight,  placed  in  a  posi- 
tion of  equilibrium  will  have  a  straight  descent  with  equal  height  in 
each  of  its  parts  without  ever  deviating  from  the  position  of  its  first 
equilibrium,  if  the  air  be  motionless  and  of  uniform  resistance,  and  this 
movement  will  be  very  slow  as  will  be  proved. 

But  if  the  heavy  substance  of  uniform  thickness  be  situated  slantwise 
in  air  of  uniform  resistance  then  its  descent  will  be  made  slantwise  and 
it  will  be  more  rapid  than  the  first  aforesaid.  e  74  r. 

OF  THE  WEIGHING  OF  LIQUIDS 

[Figure] 

The  balance  a  e  g  is  formed  of  two  tubes  joined  at  an  angle  in  the 
lower  part,  and  the  water  that  is  enclosed  within  them  is  joined  hav- 
ing in  the  one  arm  a  quantity  of  oil  and  in  the  other  plain  water. 


538  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

I  say  that  the  level  of  the  water  in  one  tube  and  the  other  will  not 
remain  in  a  position  of  equality,  nor  will  the  surface  of  the  oil  find 
itself  in  a  position  of  equality  with  the  surface  of  the  water  placed  in 
the  opposite  tube.  This  is  proved  because  the  oil  is  less  heavy  than  the 
water  and  for  this  reason  it  remains  above  the  water,  and  its  heaviness 
united  in  the  same  tube  with  the  heaviness  of  the  water  that  lies  be- 
neath it  makes  itself  equal  to  the  weight  of  the  water  that  is  united 
to  it  as  a  counterweight  in  the  opposite  tube.  But  since  it  is  said  that 
oil  is  less  heavy  than  water  it  is  necessary,  if  one  should  desire  to  create 
an  equivalent  to  the  weight  of  the  water  that  is  lacking  beneath  it,  that 
there  should  be  a  greater  quantity  than  of  this  water  that  is  lacking, 
and  that  as  a  consequence  it  occupies  more  space  in  this  tube  than  an 
equivalent  weight  of  water  would  have  occupied;  and  therefore  the 
surface  of  the  oil  in  its  tube  is  higher  than  the  surface  of  the  water  in 
the  opposite  tube,  and  the  surface  of  the  water  that  is  beneath  the  oil 
is  lower  than  the  surface  of  the  water  opposite.  e  74  v. 

OF  THE  DESCENT  OF  HEAVY  BODIES 

Of  heavy  bodies  which  are  not  flexible  and  are  of  equal  weight  one 
with  another,  there  will  be  the  same  proportion  between  the  speed  of 
their  descent  as  is  that  of  their  uniform  bulk. 

Whether  the  air  which  clothes  bodies  with  itself  moves  together 
with  these  bodies. 

The  air  that  clothes  bodies  with  itself  moves  together  with  these 
bodies:  this  experience  shows  us  when  the  horse  runs  along  dusty  roads. 

Whether  the  movement  of  the  air  is  as  swift  as  its  mover. 

The  air  will  never  have  swiftness  equal  to  that  of  its  mover;  and  this 
is  shown  us  by  the  movements  of  the  dust  that  I  have  already  men- 
tioned which  follows  the  course  of  the  horse,  for  after  having  moved 
a  very  short  distance  it  turns  back  with  an  eddying  movement  and 
thereby  consumes  its  impetus.  e  80  r. 

[Of  movement] 

First:  If  a  power  move  a  body  through  a  certain  space  in  a  certain 
time  the  same  power  will  move  the  half  the  body  in  the  same  time 
twice  the  space.  Second:  Or  the  same  virtue  will  move  the  half  of  this 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  539 

body  through  this  whole  space  in  half  this  time.  Third  (as  Second). 
Fourth:  And  the  half  of  this  virtue  will  move  the  half  of  this  body 
through  all  this  space  in  the  same  time.  Fifth:  And  this  virtue  will 
move  twice  this  movable  body  through  the  whole  of  this  space  in 
twice  this  time,  and  a  thousand  times  this  movable  body  through  the 
whole  of  this  space  in  a  thousand  such  periods  of  time.  Sixth:  And  the 
half  of  this  virtue  will  move  this  whole  body  through  half  of  this  space 
in  this  whole  time,  and  a  hundred  times  this  body  through  the  hun- 
dredth part  of  this  space  in  the  same  time.  Seventh:  And  if  separate 
virtues  move  two  separate  movable  things  though  a  given  space  in  a 
given  time,  the  same  virtues  united  will  move  the  same  bodies  united 
through  this  same  space  in  this  same  time,  because  in  this  case  the  first 
proportions  remain  always  the  same.  f  26  r. 

OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  THE  AIR  ENCLOSED  BENEATH 

THE  WATER 

Whether  the  air  escapes  from  beneath  the  water  by  its  nature  or 
through  its  being  pressed  and  driven  by  the  water. 

The  reply  is  that  since  a  heavy  substance  cannot  be  supported  by  a 
light  one  this  heavy  substance  will  proceed  to  fall  and  seek  what  may 
support  it,  because  every  natural  action  seeks  to  be  at  rest;  consequently 
that  water  which  surrounds  this  air  above,  on  the  sides  and  below  finds 
itself  all  spread  against  the  air  enclosed  by  it,  and  all  that  which  is 
above  d  e  n  m,  pushes  this  air  downwards,  and  would  keep  it  below 
itself  if  it  were  not  that  the  laterals  a  b  e  f  and  abed  which  surround 
this  air  and  rest  upon  its  sides  came  to  be  a  more  preponderant  weight 
than  the  water  which  is  above  it;  consequently  this  air  escapes  by  the 
angles  n  m  either  on  one  side  or  on  the  other,  and  goes  winding  as 
it  rises. 

As  much  force  is  exerted  when  an  object  is  moved  against  the  mo- 
tionless air  as  when  the  air  is  moved  against  a  motionless  object. 

I  have  seen  movements  of  the  air  so  violent  as  to  carry  away  and 
strew  in  their  course  immense  forest  trees  and  whole  roofs  of  great 
palaces;  and  I  have  seen  this  same  fury  with  its  whirling  movement 
bore  a  hole  in  and  hollow  out  a  bank  of  shingle  and  carry  away  in  the 
air  gravel,  sand  and  water  for  more  than  half  a  mile. 


54o  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

The  same  weight  will  be  sustained  in  the  air  without  movement,  if 
falling  there  with  slanting  movement,  it  is  able  afterwards  to  raise 
itself  up  very  high  with  a  reflex  movement.  f  37  v. 

How  much  air  is  required  to  raise  various  heavy  objects  of  different 
material  ? 

How  much  water  entering  into  the  boat  will  cause  it  to  sink? 

Which  air  supports  more  [?less]?  That  enclosed  or  rarefied  as  is 
the  case  in  cupping  glasses?  Or  in  its  natural  state?  Or  when  com- 
pressed, as  it  is  in  balls  which  are  inflated  by  the  force  of  a  screw? 
There  can  be  no  doubt  that  it  is  the  rarefied,  then  that  in  its  natural 
state,  and  the  compressed  air  resists  least  [?most]. 

Each  part  of  the  volume  of  the  water  which  falls  from  the  river 
through  the  air  follows  the  line  in  which  the  impetus  was  commenced 
which  led  it  to  this  fall.  f  47  v. 

[Movement  of  liquids] 

The  natural  movements  of  liquids  in  the  air  are  swifter  and  more 
diffused  at  the  end  than  at  the  beginning. 

The  seminatural  movements  made  by  the  water  between  the  bed 
of  the  river  and  the  air  will  be  of  equal  speed  if  the  bed  of  this  river 
is  straight  and  equal  in  slant  and  breadth. 

The  accidental  movements  made  within  the  air  become  slower  at 
every  stage  of  height. 

The  semiaccidental  movements  made  between  the  bed  of  the  canal 
and  the  air  upon  a  bed  of  uniform  slant  and  width  always  tend  to 
become  slower,  but  are  longer  than  the  simple-accidental  because  they 
proceed  to  support  themselves  and  always  lighten  themselves  of  part 
of  their  weight.  f  50  v. 

First.  If  a  power  move  a  body  a  certain  space  in  a  certain  time  the 
same  power  will  move  the  half  of  this  body  in  the  same  time  twice 
this  space. 

Second.  If  any  force  move  any  movable  thing  through  a  certain 
space  in  a  certain  time  the  same  force  will  move  the  half  of  this 
movable  thing  through  the  whole  of  this  space  in  half  this  time. 

Third.  If  a  force  move  a  body  in  a  certain  time  a  certain  space  the 


MOVEMENT   AND  WEIGHT  541 

same  force  will  move  the  half  of  this  body  in  the  same  time  the  half 
of  this  space. 

[Fourth:  |  If  a  force  move  a  body  in  a  certain  time  a  certain  space 
it  is  not  necessary  that  this  power  move  twice  this  weight  in  twice  the 
time  twice  this  space,  because  it  might  be  that  this  force  would  not  be 
sufficient  to  move  this  movable  thing. 

[Fifth?]  If  a  force  move  a  body  in  a  particular  time  a  particular 
space  it  is  not  necessary  that  the  half  of  this  force  move  this  same 
movable  body  in  the  same  time  the  half  of  this  space  for  perhaps  it 
would  not  be  able  to  move  it. 

Sixth.  If  two  separate  forces  move  two  separate  movable  things  the 
same  forces  united  will  move  in  the  same  time  the  two  movable  things 
joined  together  for  the  same  space  because  there  remains  still  the  same 
proportion.  f  51  v. 

Fourth.  If  a  power  move  a  body  in  a  particular  time  a  particular 
space  half  the  force  will  move  in  the  same  time  half  the  movable  thing 
half  this  space. 

If  every  movable  thing  pursues  its  movement  along  the  line  of  its 
commencement  what  is  it  that  causes  the  movement  of  the  arrow  or 
thunderbolt  to  swerve  and  bend  in  so  many  directions  whilst  still  in 
the  air? 

What  has  been  said  may  spring  from  two  causes  one  of  which  is 
that  the  air  which  is  compressed  before  the  fury  of  its  onset  offers  re- 
sistance to  it,  and  consequently  this  movement  becomes  bent  and  as- 
sumes the  nature  of  a  reflex  movement  though  it  does  not  proceed  in 
straight  lines.  Its  action  is  as  in  the  third  of  the  fifth  concerning  water, 
where  it  is  shown  how  sometimes  the  air  issuing  out  of  the  beds  of  the 
swamps  in  the  form  of  bubbles  comes  to  the  surface  of  the  water  with 
sinuous  curving  movement.  The  second  manner  of  sinuous  movement 
of  the  flash  of  lightning  may  arise  from  the  fact  that  the  substance  of 
the  thunderbolt  discharges  itself  now  to  the  right  and  now  to  the  left, 
now  upwards  and  now  downwards,  acting  in  the  same  way  as  the 
spark  that  leaps  from  the  lighted  coal;  for  if  the  coal  exhales  gas  from 
one  of  its  sides  it  becomes  disintegrated  by  the  damp  spreading  within 
it  and  bursting  into  flame  separates  these  pieces  of  coal  and  produces 
another  spark,  which  at  its  birth  strikes  against  the  rest  and  drives  it 


542  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

back;  and  this  then  does  the  same  again  in  different  directions  throw- 
ing out  a  succession  of  sparks  into  the  air  until  it  is  itself  consumed. 
But  to  me  the  first  explanation  pleases  most  because  if  the  second  were 
true  you  would  see  that  a  single  thunderbolt  would  produce  many 
just  as  this  spark  does.  f  52  r. 


CONCERNING  THE  LOCAL  MOVEMENT  OF  FLEXIBLE  DRY 
THINGS  SUCH  AS  DUST  AND  THE  LIKE 

I  say  that  when  a  table  is  struck  in  different  places  the  dust  that  is 
upon  it  is  reduced  to  various  shapes  of  mounds  and  tiny  hillocks — and 
this  arises  from  .  .  . 

The  dust  which  when  the  table  is  struck  is  divided  into  various 
hillocks  descends  from  the  hypotenuse  of  these  hillocks,  enters  beneath 
their  base  and  raises  itself  again  round  the  axis  of  the  point  of  the 
hillock,  and  so  moves  as  to  seem  a  right-angled  triangle;  and  this  arises 
from  .  .  . 

When  the  dusty  table  is  struck  at  one  side  observe  the  manner  in 
which  the  movement  of  the  dust  commences  to  create  the  aforesaid 
hillocks,  and  how  this  dust  rises  to  the  top  of  the  hillock.         f  61  r. 

MOVABLE  THINGS   IN  THE   AIR 

The  movement  of  the  air  is  less  in  front  of  the  movable  thing  that 
penetrates  through  it  than  it  is  behind  this  movable  thing. 

The  air  that  fills  the  void  which  the  movable  thing  leaves  of  itself 
as  it  penetrates  through  this  air  has  its  whole  mass  of  equal  speed  to 
that  possessed  by  this  movable  thing;  but  the  parts  of  this  air  because 
it  is  of  the  nature  of  a  vortex,  that  is  with  circling  movement  in  the 
form  of  eddies,  is  much  swifter  in  itself  than  the  movement  of  the 
aforesaid  movable  thing. 

Here  it  seems  that  because  the  movable  thing  has  more  swiftness  of 
air  behind  it  than  in  front  this  air  is  the  cause  of  the  movement  of 
this  movable  thing,  and  by  the  seventh  this  cannot  be. 

No  movable  thing  is  ever  swifter  than  the  swiftness  of  the  power 
which  moves  it. 

The  wave  that  the  air  makes  before  the  movable  thing  which  pene- 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  54< 

(rates  it  docs  not  pass  almost  in  front  of  this  movable  thing,  because 
thft  would  be  contrary  to  the  seventh,  the  last  but  one. 

The  air  behind  the  movable  thing  turns  back  revolving  in  those 
parts  which  border  on  that  which  flows  behind  the  movable  thing. 

The  air  that  flows  behind  the  moveable  thing  which  wanders  through 
it  is  moved  by  the  impetus  afforded  it  by  this  movable  thing;  and 
striking  with  its  great  expanding  wave  upon  the  other  air  it  turns 
back,  and  with  a  great  revolving  movement  which  grows  less  at  its 
extremities  it  finally  comes  to  stop  and  does  not  follow  this  movable 
thing.  f  74  r. 

WHY  THE  MOVABLE  THING  FOLLOWS  THE  MOVEMENT 
COMMENCED  BY  ITS  MOVER 

No  impulse  can  end  immediately  but  proceeds  to  consume  itself 
through  stages  of  movement. 

The  air  which  was  at  first  behind  the  hole  made  by  the  movable 
thing  in  the  air  accompanies  this  movable  thing  only  a  little  way, 
according  to  the  eighth. 

Eighth.  The  air  which  successively  surrounds  the  movable  thing 
that  is  moving  through  it  makes  divers  movements  in  itself.  This  is 
seen  in  the  atoms  that  are  found  in  the  sphere  of  the  sun  when  they 
penetrate  through  some  window  into  a  dark  place.  If  among  these 
atoms  one  throws  a  stone  in  the  length  of  the  solar  ray  one  sees  the 
atoms  range  themselves  about  the  position  where  the  course  taken  in 
this  air  by  the  movable  thing  was  filled  by  the  air,  as  is  proved  in  the 
fifth. 

Fifth.  Nothing  that  is  not  provided  with  power  of  sensation  moves 
of  itself,  but  its  movement  is  made  by  others;  and  the  movement  pro- 
duced acts  very  briefly  in  the  time  and  in  the  space  that  necessity  gives, 
as  is  shown  in  the  fourth} 

Fourth.  The  air  which  moves  to  fill  up  the  vacuum  made  in  it  by 
the  movable  thing  has  in  itself  varying  degrees  of  speed  density  and 
movement.  f  74  v. 

Every  movable  thing  that  creates  a  reflex  action  ends  it  course  in 
the  line  of  its  incidence. 

1  Words  crossed  out  in  MS. 


544  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

This  happens  because  the  movement  of  its  incidence  is  of  greater 
power  than  the  reflex  movement  and  that  which  is  more  powerful  has 
more  duration  than  the  less  powerful. 

The  movement  of  incidence  of  the  movable  thing  will  be  more 
powerful  than  its  reflex  movement,  because  the  percussion  of  the 
incidence  made  upon  the  dense  object  diminishes  in  part  the  impetus 
united  to  this  movable  object,  and  this  diminution  does  not  leave  this 
reflex  movement  as  powerful  as  it  has  been  said  the  movement  of  inci- 
dence is.  In  every  stage  of  movement  however  the  impetus  of  the 
movable  thing  is  diminished  of  itself  apart  from  its  percussion  with 
a  dense  object,  and  it  does  not  follow  that  this  percussion  will  not 
lessen  it  much  more,  seeing  that  if  you  measure  the  movement  which 
this  movable  thing  would  have  made  without  incidence  and  the  move- 
ments produced  by  many  bounds  up  and  down,  you  will  find  that 
the  continuous  movement  in  the  same  spot  will  be  longer  than  that 
which  is  frequently  broken  by  the  incidences,  even  though  the  begin- 
nings of  the  impetus  in  each  of  them  were  of  equal  power  one  with 
another.  f  75  v. 

The  more  deeply  an  object  is  sunk  in  water  the  less  is  it  moved 
by  the  wind  which  strikes  the  part  of  it  that  is  above  the  water.  This 
is  contrary  to  Battista  Alberti  who  gives  a  general  rule  of  how  much 
the  wind  drives  a  ship  in  an  hour.  f  82  r. 

The  very  rapid  friction  of  two  thick  bodies  produce  fire,     f  85  v. 

An  object  that  has  its  sides  set  slantwise  in  the  middle  of  the  course 
of  the  water,  although  the  water  strikes  upon  its  smooth  side,  will  go 
in  greater  bulk  towards  the  side  of  the  slant  that  is  lower. 


OF  THE  AIR 

And  because  as  is  proved  in  the  seventh,  it  is  not  alien  to  the  nature 
of  the  air  to  become  compressed  and  rarefied  almost  in  a  moment, — 
and  this  is  not  found  possible  with  water,  which  keeps  its  first  form, — 
it  is  therefore  easier  for  the  air  at  the  side  of  and  above  the  movable 
thing  to  descend  there  in  order  to  fill  the  vacuum  of  itself  left  by  this 
movable  thing  above  itself,  than  for  the  air  beneath  to  bend  and  move 


MOVEMENT   AND   WEIGHT  545 

in  a  long  curving  line  in  order  to  fill  up  this  vacuum;  and  this  is  also 

impossible  by  the  eighth,  which  proves  that  every  impetus  moves  this 
air  with  it  along  the  line  in  which  this  impetus  is  created,  as  the  wind 
which  moves  as  much  air  as  its  impetus  moves,  as  is  seen  with  the 
dust  stirred  by  these  winds  or  with  the  atoms  floating  in  the  sun's  rays 
when  they  are  blown  about  by  it.  So  therefore  the  air,  being  driven  by 
the  impetus  of  the  heavy  substance  which  descends  there,  flies  by  the 
line  of  the  movement  made  by  its  mover,  that  at  the  side  becomes 
changed  into  lateral  eddies,  and  the  upper  air  descends  there  from 
above,  always  filling  up  the  vacuum  that  the  movable  thing  leaves 
above  of  itself  at  each  stage  of  its  movement. 

The  air  below  the  movable  thing  which  descends  through  it  becomes 
dense  and  above  it  becomes  rarefied.  f  87  r. 

The  movement  that  the  air  makes  in  the  air  compresses  itself  and 
the  air  that  it  strikes. 

Air  moved  in  a  body  that  is  thicker  than  itself  compresses  itself  more 
than  when  it  moves  in  other  air. 

Air  moved  within  a  body  lighter  than  itself  becomes  rarefied. 

Water  moved  within  a  body  lighter  than  itself  comes  to  be  rarefied 
not  in  its  quality  but  in  the  quantity  of  its  dispersion  and  extension.

Of  the  proportion  that  the  movement  of  water  has  which  is  poured 
out  of  the  bottom  of  a  very  long  trench,  the  exit  of  which  is  a  hundred 
times  narrower  than  the  breadth  and  depth  of  the  trench: 

It  may  be  asked  how  much  slower  will  be  the  movement  of  the 
water  in  the  upper  part  of  the  trench  than  the  movement  of  the  'rozza' 
which  is  formed  of  the  same  breadth  as  the  mouth  by  which  the  water 
issues  from  the  trench.  f  95  r. 

I  have  learnt  from  percussion  that  the  falling  movement  exceeds  the 
reflex  movement.  c  1  r. 


OF  THE  SCIENCE  OF  WEIGHTS  [with  diagram] 

The  heavy  object  which  descends  freely  does  not  give  its  weight  to 
any  support.  This  may  be  proved:  a  is  one  and  b  is  two;  it  follows  that 


546  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

m  supports  only  two  because  the  excess  that  b  which  is  two  has  over 
one  is  one.  And  this  one  finding  no  resistance  in  a  descends  freely,  for 
it  has  no  support  and  not  having  any  support  does  not  have  its  move- 
ment impeded.  Therefore  m  the  extremity  of  the  balance  is  not  sensible 
of  this  excess  because  that  which  falls  is  not  supported.  g  13  v. 


OF  THE  NATURE  OF  THE  CORDS  PLACED  IN  THE  TACKLES 

The  cords  of  the  tackles  will  be  broken  in  the  contact  of  the  cord  of 
the  motive  power  with  the  first  pulley.  This  is  proved  by  the  ninth  of 
this  which  says:  'The  cords  in  the  tackles  which  descend  always 
undergo  greater  strain  than  those  that  rise'.  And  'Of  the  cords  that 
descend  the  last  feels  less  of  the  force  of  the  motive  power  than  the 
first'.  And  'The  cords  of  the  tackles  feel  more  weight  in  proportion 
as  they  are  swifter:  of  the  cords  that  move  within  the  tackles  the  last 
is  swifter  than  any  of  the  others.' 

QUESTION  OF  THE  WEIGHTS  DESCENDING 

The  question  is  whether  the  weights  descending  in  the  pulleys  give 
more  or  less  of  their  weight  to  the  pivots  of  the  tackles  as  they  descend 
than  when  they  are  stationary.  g  17  v. 

OF  THE  DIFFERENCES  THAT  THERE  ARE  BETWEEN  FORCE 
AND  WEIGHT,  AND  FIRST  OF  FORCE 

Of  the  spring  and  counterpoise  of  equal  powers  it  is  always  the 
spring  which  is  worth  more,  seeing  that  its  power  is  pyramidal;  and 
its  greatest  power  is  at  the  commencement  of  its  movement.  But  the 
counterpoise  has  a  compound  power,  one  part  of  which  is  cylindrical 
and  the  other  pyramidal.  The  cylindrical  is  such  that  the  weight  is 
always  equal  in  itself  and  draws  with  an  equal  power  both  at  the 
beginning  of  the  movement  and  at  the  end.  But  the  pyramidal  com- 
mences in  an  instant  and  at  a  point,  and  with  each  degree  of  move- 
ment and  of  time  it  acquires  volume  and  speed,  its  movement  being 
free  and  swift.  But  in  the  slow  movement  made  by  the  heavy  substance 
the  pyramidal  power  ceases  and  there  only   remains  the  cylindrical

power,  which  as  has  been  said  is  worth  at  the  beginning  as  much  as 
I  may  be  worth  at  the  middle  or  at  the  end  or  in  any  other  part  of  its 
movement.  c  30  r. 

CONCERNING  WEIGHTS 

If  the  angle  formed  by  the  meeting  of  two  slanting  cords  which 
descend  to  the  point  of  suspension  of  a  heavy  body  is  divided  by  the 
centre  line  of  the  heavy  body,  this  angle  is  divided  into  two  parts 
which  will  have  the  same  proportion  between  them  as  that  in  which 
the  said  heavy  body  is  divided  within  the  two  cords. 

If  the  angle  formed  by  the  meeting  of  the  two  cords  that  descend  to 
the  point  of  suspension  of  a  heavy  body  is  divided  by  the  intercentric 
line  which  passes  through  this  heavy  body,  this  angle  is  then  divided 
into  two  other  angles,  between  which  there  is  the  same  proportion  as 
that  from  base  to  base  and  from  angle  to  angle,  and  equally  from 
whole  triangle  to  whole  triangle;  and  these  proportions  resemble  those 
of  the  weights  which  the  heavy  body  gives  of  itself  to  its  supports.

OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  SHIPS   [Drawings]  b  a,  d  c,  f  e 

These  three  ships  of  uniform  breadth,  length  and  depth  when  pro- 
pelled by  equal  powers  will  have  different  speed  of  movement;  for  the 
ship  that  presents  its  widest  part  in  front  is  swifter,  and  it  resembles 
the  shape  of  birds  and  fishes  such  as  the  mullet.  And  this  ship  opens 
with  its  side  and  in  front  of  it  a  great  quantity  of  water,  which  after- 
wards with  its  revolutions  presses  against  the  last  two  thirds  of  the 
ship.  The  ship  d  c  does  the  opposite,  and  /  e  has  a  movement  midway 
between  the  two  aforesaid.  •  g  50  v. 

OF  A  MOVABLE  THING  NOT  OF  UNIFORM  WEIGHT 
MOVING  IN  AIR  OR  WATER 

In  movable  things  uniform  in  substance  but  not  of  uniform  weight 
the  heaviest  part  always  serves  as  a  guide. 


548  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

The  pyramidal  weight  uniformly  irregular  in  size  which  is  pushed 
by  the  bow  with  the  point  forward  will  turn  its  base  immediately

OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  THE  MOVABLE  THING 

An  arrow  shot  from  the  prow  of  a  ship  in  the  direction  in  which 
the  ship  is  moving  will  not  appear  to  stir  from  the  place  at  which  it 
was  shot  if  the  ship's  movement  be  equal  to  that  of  the  arrow. 

But  if  the  arrow  from  such  a  ship  be  shot  in  the  direction  from 
whence  it  is  going  away  with  the  above-mentioned  rate  of  speed  this 
arrow  will  be  separated  from  the  ship  with  twice  its  movement.

away. 

The  movement  of  the  liquid  which  flows  through  the  bottom  of  the 
movable  vessel  will  be  in  a  straight  line  situated  slantwise,  the  slant 
being  at  a  greater  or  less  angle  according  as  the  movement  of  the  vessel 
is  swifter  or  slower. 

Of  the  movement  made  by  the  place  that  receives  the  thing  poured 
out  from  the  vessel. 

There  is  as  much  force  necessary  to  receive  upon  the  moving  place 
the  thing  which  is  poured  from  the  immovable  vessel  as  there  is  to 
move  the  vessel  which  causes  the  thing  to  pour  upon  an  immovable 
place. 

But  if  the  movement  of  the  vessel  that  pours  equals  the  movement 
of  the  place  which  receives  upon  it  the  thing  that  is  poured  the  move- 
ment of  the  thing  that  descends  is  a  slanting  straight  line,  as  is  shown 
above. 

OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  THE  ARROW  DRIVEN  BY  THE  BOW 

The  arrow  shot  from  the  centre  of  the  earth  to  the  highest  part  of 
the  elements  will  ascend  and  descend  by  the  same  straight  line  al- 
though the  elements  may  be  in  a  movement  of  circumvolution  round 
their  centre. 


MOVEMENT   AND   WEIGHT  549 

The  gravity  which  descends  through  the  elements  when  they  are  in 
circumvolution  always  has  its  movement  to  correspond  to  the  direction 
of  the  line  that  extends  from  the  commencing  point  of  the  movement 
towards  the  centre  of  the  world.  g  54  v. 


OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  THE  MOVABLE  THING 

Of  the  heavy  substance  descending  through  the  air,  the  elements 
that  revolve  making  their  entire  revolution  in  twenty-four  hours: 

The  moving  substance  that  descends  from  the  uppermost  part  of  the 
sphere  of  fire  will  make  a  straight  movement  as  far  as  the  earth  al- 
though the  elements  are  in  perpetual  revolving  movement  round  the 
centre  of  the  world.  This  is  proved: — let  b  be  the  heavy  substance 
which  descends  through  the  elements  which  moves  from  a  to  descend 
to  the  centre  of  the  world  m ;  I  say  that  such  heavy  substance,  although 
it  may  make  a  curved  descent  in  the  form  of  a  spiral  line,  will  never 
deviate  from  its  rectilinear  descent  by  which  it  advances  continually 
between  the  place  from  whence  it  is  separated  and  the  centre  of  the 
world;  for  if  it  were  parted  from  the  point  a  and  descended  to  by  dur- 
ing the  time  in  which  it  has  descended  to  b  it  has  been  carried  to  d, 
the  position  of  the  a  has  become  changed  to  c,  and  so  the  movable 
thing  finds  itself  in  the  [line  of]  direction  that  extends  between  c  and 
the  centre  of  the  world  m.  If  the  movable  thing  descends  from  d  to  /, 
the  beginning  of  the  movement  moves  in  the  same  time  from  c  to  /, 
and  if  /  descends  to  h  it  turns  at  g,  and  so  in  twenty-four  hours  the 
movable  thing  drops  to  the  earth  below  the  place  from  which  it  was 
first  separated,  and  such  a  movement  is  composite. 

If  the  movable  thing  descends  from  the  highest  to  the  lowest  part 
of  the  elements  in  twenty-four  hours  its  movement  is  formed  of 
straight  and  curve.  I  say  straight  because  it  will  never  deviate  from  the 
very  short  line  which  extends  from  the  place  from  which  it  is  sep- 
arated to  the  centre  of  the  elements,  and  it  will  stop  at  the  lowest 
extremity  of  such  line  of  direction,  which  is  always  found  according 
to  the  zenith  beneath  the  place  from  whence  this  movable  thing  is 
separated.  And  this  movement  is  curved  in  itself  in  all  the  parts  of  the 
line  and  as  a  consequence  at  the  end  it  is  curved  in  all  the  line.  And

OF  SIMPLE  IMPETUS 

Simple  impetus  is  that  which  moves  the  arrow  or  the  dart  through 
the  air. 

Compound  impetus  is  that  which  moves  the  stone  when  it  issues 
from  the  sling,  and  this  impetus  is  not  of  long  duration  because  the 
noise  produced  by  the  revolving  movement  of  the  movable  thing  re- 
veals to  us  that  this  movable  thing  meets  with  resistance  in  the  air  that 
it  penetrates.  g  72  v. 

OF  IMPETUS 

Impetus  is  the  impression  of  movement  transmitted  by  the  mover  to 
the  movable  thing. 

Impetus  is  a  power  impressed  by  the  mover  on  the  movable  thing. 

Every  impression  tends  to  permanence  or  desires  permanence. 

This  is  proved  in  the  impression  made  by  the  sun  in  the  eye  of  the 
spectator  and  in  the  impression  of  the  sound  made  by  the  clapper  as 
it  strikes  the  bell. 

Every  impression  desires  permanence  as  is  shown  by  the  image  of 
the  movement  impressed  upon  the  movable  thing.  g  73  r. 

OF  PERCUSSION 

The  air  that  is  compressed  beneath  the  movable  thing  as  it  descends 
through  it  in  a  slanting  position  flees  more  from  the  upper  than  from 
the  lower  part  of  this  movable  thing. 

Continuous  tracts  of  air  are  as  much  rarefied  on  the  one  side  as  they 
are  compressed  on  the  other. 

The  rarefied  part  of  the  air  offers  so  much  less  resistance  as  the  com- 
pressed part  offers  more  resistance.  Therefore  the  back  part  of  the 
movable  thing,  b,  will  descend  with  greater  impetus  than  its  front  part, 
and  this  is  the  reason  why  the  front  a  which  at  the  outset  was  below, 
at  the  end  of  the  reflex  movement  is  raised  up.  g  73  v. 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  551 

OF  THE  DESCENT  OF  THE  HEAVY  BODY 

Every  natural  action  is  made  in  the  shortest  way:  this  is  why  the  free 
descent  of  the  heavy  body  is  made  towards  the  centre  of  the  world 
because  it  is  the  shortest  space  between  the  movable  thing  and  the 
lowest  depth  of  the  universe.  g  75  r. 


OF  WEIGHT 

Every  heavy  substance  when  it  moves  horizontally  has  only  weight 
in  the  line  of  its  movement.  This  is  shown  by  the  first  part  of  the 
movement  made  by  the  ball  from  a  mortar,  this  movement  being  in 
a  horizontal  direction. 

But  the  heavy  substance  floating  in  the  wind  in  any  direction  will 
have  so  much  more  or  less  gravity  round  the  front  than  in  the  beam 
of  the  balance,  according  as  the  junction  of  the  pendulum  of  the 
weight  with  the  arm  of  the  balance  is  nearer  to  a  right  angle. 

The  revolving  movement  made  rapidly  by  the  weight  round  the 
fixed  point  of  its  axis  will  have  so  much  more  heaviness  in  this  weight 
as  this  revolving  movement  is  more  rapid.  g  77  r. 

OF  THE  WEIGHT  OF  THE  BEAM  OF  THE  BALANCE 

The  weight  that  the  beam  of  the  balance  has  is  divided  in  two  parts, 
of  which  one  tends  towards  the  centre  of  the  world  and  the  other  is 
accidental,  because  it  moves  by  transverse  movement.  But  the  first, 
which  casts  its  weight  towards  the  centre  of  the  world,  has  equal 
lateral  weights  on  either  side,  and  these  fix  in  accordance  with  their 
centres  of  gravity  and  their  distances  the  mathematical  centre  of  this 
balance.  The  second  mathematical  centre  may  rather  be  termed  the 
point  of  mathematical  contact  of  the  pole  of  the  balance  with  its  sup- 
port, and  this  is  away  from  the  centre  of  the  natural  gravity  of  the 
balance  by  as  much  space  as  the  upper  part  of  this  balance  exceeds  the 
lower  part  in  weight;  for  which  reason  the  transverse  weight  of  this 
balance  does  not  of  itself  give  weight  to  either  of  the  two  above- 
mentioned  centres;  and  this  is  proved  in  the  sixth  of  this  which  says: 
— 'Every  parallel  body  of  uniform  thickness  and  weight  placed  slant- 


552  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

wise  has  in  it  two  divided  gravities  of  which  the  one  tends  towards  the 
centre  of  the  world  and  the  other  is  transverse.'  But  the  one  is  natural 
and  simple  and  the  other  accidental  and  compound. 

But  if  such  body  situated  in  such  a  way  has  a  free  descent  in  the  air 
the  centres  of  the  two  gravities  will  become  transformed  one  into  the 
other  during  some  period  of  movement;  and  at  the  end  there  will 
remain  one  single  centre  common  to  all  the  heavy  substance  that  de- 
scends; and  thus  with  straight  movement  it  will  penetrate  all  the  air 
that  is  below  it.  g  79  v. 

WHAT  IS  IMPETUS 

Impetus  is  that  which  under  another  name  is  termed  derived  move- 
ment, which  arises  out  of  primary  movement,  that  is  to  say  when  the 
movable  thing  is  joined  to  its  mover. 

In  no  part  of  the  derived  movement  will  one  ever  find  a  velocity 
equal  to  that  of  the  primary  movement.  This  is  proved,  because  at 
every  stage  of  movement  as  with  the  cord  of  the  bow  there  is  a  loss  of 
the  acquired  power  which  has  been  communicated  to  it  by  its  mover. 
And  because  every  effect  partakes  of  its  cause  the  derived  movement 
of  the  arrow  goes  lessening  its  power  by  degrees,  and  thus  participates 
in  the  power  of  the  bow  which  as  it  was  produced  by  degrees  is  so 
destroyed. 

The  impetus  impressed  by  the  mover  on  the  movable  thing  is  in- 
fused in  all  the  united  parts  of  this  movable  thing. 

And  this  is  shown  because  all  the  parts  both  those  internal  and  those 
of  the  surface  are  of  equal  movement  except  as  regards  the  movement 
of  circumvolution,  for  in  this  the  more  impetuous  part  always  revolves 
round  the  less  impetuous,  that  is  those  which  are  nearer  the  centre  of 
the  movable  thing.  And  the  part  that  was  first  moved  always  remains 
more  distant  from  the  beginning  of  its  movement  if  it  is  not  checked, 
and  this  is  admitted  because  it  is  more  potent  in  its  capacity  to  revolve. 

And  if  one  were  to  say  with  the  adversary  that  the  impetus  which 
moves  the  movable  thing  is  in  the  air  that  surrounds  it  from  the  mid- 
dle backwards,  one  would  deny  this,  because  the  air  that  follows  the 
movable  thing  is  drawn  by  the  movable  thing  to  fill  the  void  left  by 
it,  and  because  also  the  air  that  is  compressed  before  the  movable  thing 
escapes  backwards  in  the  opposite  direction. 


MOVEMENT   AND   WEIGHT  553 

And  it  the  air  turns  back  it  is  a  manifest  proof  that  it  strikes  against 
that  which  the  movable  thing  draws  behind  it;  and  when  two  things 
collide  the  reflex  movement  of  each  starts,  and  these  reflex  movements 
are  converted  into  whirling  movements  which  are  carried  by  the  air 
that  fills  up  the  vacuum  left  by  the  movable  body,  and  it  is  impossible 
for  the  movement  of  the  mover  to  be  increased  by  the  movement  of 
the  movable  body  in  the  same  time,  because  the  mover  is  always  more 
powerful  than  the  movable  thing.  g  85  v. 


OF  MOVEMENT  AND  OF  THE  MOVABLE  THING 

Which  will  remove  the  same  movable  thing  a  farther  distance,  a 
great  power  with  a  small  movement  or  a  lesser  power  with  a  greater 
movement  ? 


The  derived  movement  made  by  the  same  movable  thing  will  be  of 
greater  length  which  has  a  greater  primary  movement  from  the  same 
mover. 

This  is  proved  because  experience  shows  us  that  the  same  power 
always  has  such  proportion  between  its  primary  movement  and  the 
derived  movement  of  its  movable  thing  which  .  .  . 

It  is  proved  by  the  fifth  of  this  which  says: — between  the  various 
lengths  of  the  primary  movement  one  will  find  that  the  various  lengths 
of  the  derived  movement  of  the  same  movable  thing  are  in  the  same 
proportions  as  their  primary  movements,  because  if  the  power  of  the 
same  mover  separates  the  movable  thing  from  itself  a  space  of  a  finger 
in  one  interval  of  harmonic  time,  the  same  power  in  two  intervals  of 
harmonic  time  will  separate  the  same  movable  thing  twice  the  same 
finger's  space  from  itself.  And  this  arises  from  the  fact  that  the  derived 
movement  always  has  the  same  proportion  as  the  primary  movement. 

The  impetus  is  not  always  produced  in  the  movable  thing  because 
not  even  the  mover  has  always  an  impetuous  movement. 

As  is  shown  by  the  light  chariot  drawn  by  oxen  over  a  level  tract, 
for  so  soon  as  the  oxen  end  their  movement  the  movement  of  the 
chariot  is  ended.  g  86  r. 


554  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

OF  THE  FIVE  DIRECTIONS  OF  MOVEMENT 

There  are  five  varieties  of  local  movements  of  which  the  first  is  up- 
wards, the  second  downwards,  the  third  in  a  horizontal  direction,  the 
fourth  slanting  upwards  and  the  fifth  and  last  slanting  downwards. 

How  the  impetus  of  movable  things  joined  by  a  cord  passes  from 
one  movable  thing  to  the  other. 

The  impetus  produced  by  the  movable  things  joined  with  a  cord 
each  of  which  is  reciprocally  the  mover,  of  the  other  will  remove  the 
two  movable  things  to  a  short  distance  from  their  first  mover. 

When  of  two  movable  things  joined  by  their  two  opposite  extremi- 
ties to  the  same  cord  the  one  is  less  than  the  other,  the  sum  of  their 
movement  will  be  less  than  if  these  movements  were  equal  to  each 
other. 

When  the  larger  of  two  weights  joined  to  a  cord  is  first  in  move- 
ment, the  movement  of  the  two  joined  together  will  be  greater  than 
if  the  beginning  of  the  movement  had  originated  with  the  lesser  mov- 
able thing.  g  86  v. 

WHAT  IS  PRIMARY  MOVEMENT 

Primary  movement  is  that  which  is  made  by  the  movable  thing 
during  the  time  when  it  is  joined  to  its  mover. 


OF  DERIVED  MOVEMENT 

Derived  movement  is  that  which  the  movable  thing  makes  in  the 
air  after  it  is  separated  from  its  mover. 

Derived  movement  has  its  origin  in  primary  movement  and  it  never 
has  swiftness  or  power  equal  to  the  swiftness  or  power  of  the  said 
primary  movement. 

The  course  of  this  movable  thing  will  be  in  conformity  with  the 
direction  of  the  course  of  its  mover  when  all  the  parts  of  this  movable 
thing  have  movement  equal  to  the  primary  movement  of  their  mover. 

If  all  the  parts  of  the  movement  made  by  the  part  of  one  whole  are 
of  equal  movement  then  this  movable  thing  will  not  revolve;  and  this 
movement  will  receive  the  whole  power  of  its  mover,  and  it  will  ob- 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  555 

serve  the  proper  length  that  its  movement  requires,  the  weight  of  the 
movable  thing  being  proportioned  to  the  power  of  its  mover,  c  87  r. 


OF  TACKLE 

The  ropes  of  the  tackle  share  in  equal  parts  the  weight  that  they 
support. 

The  power  that  moves  the  tackle  is  pyramidal  since  it  proceeds  to 
delay  with  uniform  lack  of  uniformity  down  to  the  last  rope. 

And  the  movement  of  the  ropes  of  this  tackle  is  pyramidal  because 
it  proceeds  to  delay  with  uniform  lack  of  uniformity  from  the  first 
cord  to  the  last. 

Therefore  the  rope  feels  the  power  of  the  mover  so  much  more 
when  it  is  swifter  and  so  much  less  when  it  is  slower. 

The  ropes  feel  the  power  of  their  mover  so  much  the  more  when 
they  are  nearer  and  so  much  less  when  they  are  farther  away. 

G    87   V. 

OF  POWER 

The  same  virtue  is  so  much  more  powerful  as  it  is  more  concen- 
trated. 

This  is  the  case  with  heat,  percussion,  weight,  force  and  many  other 
things.  And  let  us  speak  first  of  the  heat  of  the  sun  which  imprints 
itself  in  a  concave  mirror  and  is  reflected  by  it  in  pyramidal  figure, 
which  pyramid  acquires  proportionately  so  much  more  power  as  it 
is  more  constricted.  That  is  that  if  the  pyramid  strikes  the  object  with 
half  its  length  it  contracts  half  its  thickness  at  its  foot;  and  if  it  strikes 
it  at  ninety-nine  hundredths  of  its  length  it  contracts  its  base  by  ninety- 
nine  hundredths  and  increases  by  ninety-nine  hundredths  the  heat 
which  this  base  receives  from  the  above-mentioned  heat  of  the  sun  or 
of  the  fire. 

Furthermore  the  percussion  of  the  pyramidal  iron  will  penetrate 
the  penetrable  thing  struck  by  its  point  to  a  greater  extent  according 
as  this  point  is  narrower. 

The  heavy  substance  also  when  constricted  in  less  space  is  of  greater 
weight  because  a  less  quantity  of  air  offers  resistance  to  it.  Of  move- 
ment and  force  we  shall  speak  elsewhere. 


556  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

So  also  such  other  qualities  as  sweetness,  bitterness,  sharpness,  rough- 
ness do  the  same  as  has  been  stated  above;  and  an  example  of  this  is 
shown  when  any  of  these  increases  in  quantity  mixing  itself  with  snow 
or  water  which  neither  gives  it  flavour  nor  takes  it  away  from  it  but 
completely  deprives  it  of  power.  g  89  v. 

The  greatest  strength  of  the  tackle  is  in  the  rope  that  is  joined  to  its 
moving  power.  And  the  least  strength  will  be  in  the  rope  that  is  joined 
to  one  of  the  tackles. 

The  weight  drawn  by  the  ropes  that  pass  through  the  tackles  is 
divided  in  equal  parts  between  the  ropes  joined  to  these  tackles. 

That  rope  of  the  tackles  will  be  swifter  which  is  nearer  to  its  mover; 
it  follows  that  the  slowest  will  be  that  which  is  farther  away  from  this 
mover.  g  95  v. 

If  a  man  be  at  the  bottom  of  a  well  which  contains  twenty  thousand

Why  the  movement  made  by  the  sieve  collects  together  at  the  top 
all  the  lightest  parts?  And  it  is  the  same  with  the  dredger  when  one 
searches  for  gold  in  the  Ticino  by  means  of  a  blow,  and  also  with  the 
sweepings  of  the  goldsmith's  workshop  when  they  are  washed.

If  the  part  of  any  substance  in  the  air  is  greater  than  that  in  the 
water  its  movement  will  follow  the  course  of  the  air.  h  59  [n]  v. 

A  straight  movement  transformed  into  another  without  rebound 
loses  its  power. 

The  natural  movement  will  impart  the  greatest  blow  which  main- 
tains in  a  straight  line  the  course  it  has  begun.  h  61  [13]  r. 

Such  part  of  water  as  is  in  contact  with  the  air  will  move  according 
to  the  course  of  this  air  although  the  water  upon  the  bottom  move  in 
a  contrary  direction.  h  61  [13]  v. 

Water  which  descends  from  a  wide  expanse  by  a  straight  channel 
will  intersect  at  its  entry  from  right  to  left. 

And  after  its  entry  the  part  in  the  centre  of  the  channel  will  be 
higher  than  all  the  rest  of  the  expanse. 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  557 

In  such  another  course  made  by  the  water  in  its  channel  the  part 
of  the  centre  will  be  lower  than  the  rest  of  the  expanse. 

As  it  follows  the  same  space  the  depression  in  the  centre  changes  to 
a  greater  height.  h  62  [14]  r. 

The  blow  is  more  powerful  than  the  movement  and  where  it  is  the 
blow  of  the  water  every  obstacle  is  removed:  then  when  the  movement 
is  afterwards  created  it  carries  with  it  all  the  gravity  occasioned  by  the 
blow  and  discharges  it  in  the  blow  made  by  the  rebound,  and  so  from 
rebound  to  rebound  the  force  of  the  violent  movement  diminishes. 
Consequently  the  heaviest  of  the  stones  are  deposited  and  not  being 
able  to  be  borne  along  by  the  feeble  movements  which  follow  they 
remain  there;  and  the  last  things  which  are  at  the  furthest  distance 
from  the  point  at  which  they  started  are  the  lightest  things.

That  part  of  the  blow  produced  by  a  continuing  cause  will  be  so 
much  the  more  powerful  as  it  is  more  distant  from  the  cause  of  its

558  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

OF  MOVEMENT  AND  PERCUSSION 

If  someone  descends  from  one  step  to  another  by  jumping  from  one 
to  the  other  and  then  you  add  together  all  the  forces  of  the  percussions 
and  the  weights  of  these  jumps,  you  will  find  that  they  are  equal  to 
the  entire  percussion  and  weight  that  such  a  man  would  produce  if 
he  fell  by  a  perpendicular  line  from  the  top  to  the  bottom  of  the  height 
of  this  staircase. 

Furthermore  if  this  man  were  to  fall  from  a  height,  striking  stage 
by  stage  upon  objects  which  would  bend  in  the  manner  of  a  spring, 
in  such  a  way  that  the  percussion  from  the  one  to  the  other  was  slight, 
you  will  find  that  at  the  last  part  of  his  descent  this  man  will  have  his 
percussion  as  much  diminished  by  comparison  with  what  it  would 
have  been  in  a  free  and  perpendicular  line,  as  it  would  be  if  there  were 
taken  from  it  all  the  percussions  joined  together  which  were  given  at 
each  stage  of  the  said  descent  upon  the  aforesaid  springs,      i  14  v. 

Pagolo  says  that  no  instrument  that  moves  another  instrument  in 
contact  with  it  can  avoid  being  moved  by  it.  So  if  the  wheel  moves  its 
pinion  the  pinion  will  also  move  this  wheel.  But  such  a  thing  is  not 
general,  for  though  the  cog  n  moves  the  wheel  the  wheel  will  not  move 
the  cog  n  turned  against  the  ground. 

The  line  of  the  movement  made  by  the  course  of  two  objects  that 
strike  which  does  not  bend  in  meeting  with  the  first  object  is  that 
which  strikes  the  second  object  more  with  its  reflex  movement;  and 
so  that  will  act  conversely  which  bends  more  in  its  impact  with  the 
first  object.  1  28  r. 

That  body  which  when  moved  strikes  the  first  object  with  a  greater 
blow  consumes  more  of  its  impetus  in  the  percussion,  with  result  that 
the  blow  made  by  the  reflex  movement  will  be  weaker.  And  the  line 
of  the  movement  which  does  not  bend  at  all  at  its  first  percussion 
strikes  the  second  object  most.  1  28  v. 

The  leap  is  always  smaller  than  the  descent  made  by  the  thing  which 
leaps;  and  this  leap  is  termed  reflex  movement,  which  is  always  weaker 
than  the  straight  movement.  1  43  v. 


MOVEMENT  AND   WEIGHT  559 

I  The  kjiije- grinder's  wheel] 

The  pole  is  worn  most  on  the  course  in  which  its  mover  exerts  the 
greatest  force;  as  is  shown  by  the  knife-grinders  who  go  through  the 
cities. 

Every  pole  becomes  worn  on  the  side  in  which  its  mover  applies 
most  force.  See  a  man  sharpening  knives  by  turning  a  wheel  with  his 
feet:  as  he  drives  his  foot  down  he  starts  the  force  which  then  pro- 
duces the  movement  of  an  entire  revolution.  One  understands  clearly 
that  in  proportion  as  this  movement  is  farther  removed  from  its  cause 
it  becomes  slower  and  wears  away  its  support  less;  and  each  time  that 
the  movement  is  repeated  the  pressure  of  the  feet  renews  it  with  fresh 
impetus,  and  again  under  this  impetus  the  support  is  consumed,  and 
so  it  comes  about  that  the  pole  is  worn  unequally.  1  45  r. 

{Movement — jailing  and  reflex] 

I  ask  whether  the  movement  made  by  the  stone  in  a  continuous  line 
is  equal  to  that  movement  which  is  in  a  reflex  line,  that  is  before  the 
rebound  and  after  the  rebound.  1  61  [13]  r. 


OF  MOVEMENT 

For  what  reason  the  mortar  does  not  follow  the  rule  of  the  carbine: 
If  for  a  ball  that  weighs  an  ounce  there  be  allowed  an  ounce  of  powder 
with  which  this  ball  is  shot  a  mile,  then  the  ball  constantly  increasing 
in  the  same  substance  with  each  degree  of  weight,  one  gives  it  a  pro- 
portionate quantity  of  powder  up  to  a  thousand  pounds,  and  increases 
the  size  of  the  machine  so  that  it  always  takes  forty  balls,  that  is  to 
forty  times  the  thickness  of  this  ball,  the  metal  being  always  half  the 
thickness  of  this  ball;  then  the  carbine  increasing  in  volume  in  all  its 
particulars  from  a  ball  of  an  ounce  to  one  of  a  thousand  pounds,  you 
will  find  that  the  more  the  ball  weighs  the  farther  it  travels. 

1  84  [36]  v. 

The  movement  made  by  the  arm  in  throwing  the  stone  is  twofold; 
for  when  the  elbow  goes  forward  and  the  fist  with  the  stone  turns 
back  with  a  circling  movement  and  then  goes  forward  and  drops  its 
stone  with  a  sudden  stoppage  of  the  arm,  this  stoppage  by  its  sudden- 
ness is  followed  by  a  recoil,  and  produces  the  effect  of  percussion  in  the 


560  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

air;  consequently  the  movement  is  much  greater  than  if  one  were  to 
move  the  arm  in  one  action  and  it  followed  a  circular  movement  in 
leaving  the  stone. 

OF  PERCUSSION 

Why  the  short  mortar  makes  a  louder  explosion  when  fired  than  the 
long  one,  as  one  hears  it  in  drawing  the  breeches  of  the  small  cannon. 

.  85  [37]  r. 

The  movement  made  by  the  cord  is  much  more  rapid  near  the  be- 
ginning than  near  the  end.  Consequently  we  may  say  that  as  the  arrow 
follows  the  nature  of  the  greatest  movement  of  the  power  that  drives 
it,  when  such  power  diminishes  the  arrow  is  already  separated  from 
the  cord,  and  the  percussion  made  by  the  arms  of  the  cross-bow  upon 
the  cord  that  holds  it  is  made  after  the  departure  of  the  arrow,  and 
therefore  this  percussion  does  not  increase  the  movement  of  this  arrow. 

1  85  [37]  v. 


MOVEMENT  INCREASED  BY  IMPETUS  AND  WEIGHT 

This  movement  is  at  first  increased  by  impetus,  because  the  more 
the  stone  which  produces  it  falls  the  more  speed  and  gravity  it  ac- 
quires; secondly  the  more  the  cord  that  is  unrolled  from  the  part  of 
the  circle  is  unrolled  the  more  distant  it  becomes  from  the  centre  of 
the  movement;  consequently  the  more  distant  it  becomes  the  more  it 
acquires  weight  and  impetus.  1  91  [43]  v. 

There  are  some  movements  of  moving  things  which  continue  their 
direction  while  receiving  percussion  in  the  middle  of  this  movement, 
and  these  are  of  great  force. 

I  ask  why  field-lances  or  hunting-whips  have  a  greater  movement 
that  the  arm.  I  say  that  this  happens  because  the  hand  describes  a  much 
wider  circle  as  the  arm  moves  than  does  the  elbow;  and  in  conse- 
quence moving  at  the  same  time  the  hand  covers  twice  as  much  space 
as  does  the  elbow,  and  therefore  it  may  be  said  to  be  of  a  speed  double 
that  of  trie  movement  of  the  elbow  and  so  it  sends  things  when  thrown 
a  greater  distance  from  itself. 


MOVEMENT   AND  WEIGHT  561 

Thus  you  sec  clearly  that  the  circuit  described  by  the  elbow  is  less 
by  half  and  its  speed  is  slower  by  half. 

It  is  true  that  if  one  takes  from  the  movement  made  by  the  hand 
an  amount  equal  to  that  made  by  the  elbow  they  become  of  equal 
slowness.  1  99  [51!  v- 

If  the  stone  moved  by  the  power  of  its  engine  follows  in  the  begin- 
ning of  its  movement  the  greatest  power  and  speed  of  its  mover,  why 
does  it  not  follow  this  same  equality  of  the  first  movement  without 
waiting  for  it  to  separate  as  it  reduces  its  speed?  If  however  it  should 
separate  immediately  what  does  it  profit  it  to  be  closely  attended  by 
such  power?  1  100  [52]  r. 

The  power  that  moves  which  accompanies  the  movable  thing 
farthest  will  cause  it  to  move  farthest  from  the  boundary  where  it  is 
separated  from  it. 

It  is  almost  universally  the  case  that  everything  which  is  the  cause 
of  movements  decreases  its  power  before  it  separates  itself  from  the 
thing  moved  by  it. 

The  mortar  only  increases  its  force  because  in  the  longer  movement 
which  the  ball  makes  in  its  body  more  powder  is  ignited,  for  it  must 
needs  be  admitted  that  this  setting  on  fire  occupies  a  divisible  period 
of  time;  and  the  more  periods  of  time  it  lasts  the  more  powder  is 
ignited,  the  more  the  fire  is  driven  through  this  machine,  and  the 
greater  the  impetus  and  fury  with  which  it  expels  the  ball. 

One  asks  with  regard  to  the  same  course  of  the  mover  whether  it 
removes  the  thing  moved  farthest  if  it  commences  with  slow  move- 
ment and  continually  increases  the  impetus,  or  if  it  commences  quickly 
and  then  proceeds  to  slacken,  or  if  it  goes  at  an  even  pace. 

1  100  [52]  v. 

I  ask  whether  if  two  movable  things  equal  in  shape  weight  and  sub- 
stance are  of  double  speed  their  course  will  be  double  the  one  of  the 
other  or  no? 

Because  one  sees  bows  and  cross-bows  with  long  arms  that  have  a 
long  and  slow  range  and  one  sees  cross-bows  with  short  thick  arms 
that  have  a  rapid  and  short  range;  the  percussions  of  the  short  make 
a  quick  passage  in  the  third  part  of  their  movement  and  the  long  make 
a  slower  one. 


562  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

In  the  consideration  of  this  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  all 
the  mathematical  forces;  seeing  that  in  the  case  of  these  cross-bows 
there  are  at  work  different  causes  which  produce  many  different 
effects,  for  there  are  found  among  them  some  with  a  great  ascent, 
some  with  a  short  one,  some  long  and  thin  and  some  fat  and  short, 
some  wide  and  some  narrow:  so  they  proceed  to  vary  in  shape  and  in 
power  in  many  different  ways.  1  101  [53]  r. 

MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT.  BALLS  SHOT  FROM  MORTARS 

To  test  the  residuum  of  power  of  the  things  that  move  and  draw 
the  weights  by  giving  them  a  greater  or  a  less  weight  see  what  is  the 
weight  which  is  most  distant  from  its  mover. 

And  let  it  always  be  round  in  shape  and  of  uniform  substance,  and 
the  balance  m  n  should  have  its  arms  of  equal  length  and  weight,  and 
the  centre  of  the  weight  which  strikes  the  centre  of  the  movable  weight 
should  be  always  raised  to  the  .  .  .  .  ,  and  moreover  when  you  have 
found  a  weight  which  recedes  more  from  the  beginning  of  the  move- 
ment going  as  rapidly  as  possible  by  way  of  percussion  and  you  re- 
produce it  with  a  simple  weight  without  percussion,  you  will  be  able 
to  discern  what  difference  there  is  between  the  causes  of  the  move- 
ments when  they  are  due  to  weight  and  when  merely  to  percussion. 
And  so  with  regard  to  this  weight  you  will  proceed  to  change  the 
things  that  it  moves  until  you  find  a  weight  which  is  proportionate  to 
the  power  of  this  mover,  that  is  the  ball  which  is  propelled  as  far  as 
possible  from  its  motive  power.  Then  weigh  one  movable  thing  and 
the  other,  and  consider  the  distances  where  they  have  been  moved,  and 
you  will  be  able  to  deduce  with  accuracy  the  general  rule  between  these 
two  powers. 

Then  diminish  the  movable  thing  by  half  as  those  agree  to  do  who 
have  written  upon  proportions,  and  you  will  see  that  it  cannot  be  that 
the  half  less  weight  will  be  moved  twice  as  quickly  by  the  same  power, 
that  is  to  say  that  if  it  was  twice  as  swift  it  would  go  twice  as  far  be- 
cause the  proportion  of  the  movements  is  as  that  of  the  speeds.  And 
if  some  have  said  that  the  more  the  movable  thing  is  diminished  the 
more  rapidly  its  mover  drives  it  in  proportion  to  its  diminution  on  to 
infinity,  constantly  acquiring  speed  of  movement;  it  would  follow  that 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  563 

an  atom  would  be  almost  as  rapid  as  thought  itself,  or  as  the  eye  which 
roves  in  an  instant  to  die  height  of  the  stars;  and  as  a  consequence  its 
journey  would  be  infinite,  because  the  thing  which  can  diminish  in- 
finitely would  increase  infinitely  in  swiftness  and  traverse  an  infinite 
distance,  because  every  continuous  quantity  is  divisible  to  infinity.  This 
opinion  however  is  condemned  by  reason  and  also  by  experience. 

It  would  follow  also  that  if  the  mortar  throws  its  ball  three  miles 
from  itself  in  twenty  divisions  of  musical  or  harmonic  time  with  a 
hundred  pounds  of  powder  and  a  thousand  balls,  that  taking  a  pound 
of  balls  it  would  make  with  the  said  powder  ...  in  the  same  time. 
Work  by  the  rule  of  three,  saying  if  a  thousand  pounds  of  stone  are 
thrown  to  me  in  two  divisions  of  time,  you  keeping  in  imagination  the 
three  thousand,  saying  also  if  a  thousand  pounds  of  balls  are  thrown 
to  me,  at  the  said  distance  in  twenty  divisions  of  time,  in  how  many 
divisions  of  time  will  the  same  power  throw  me  a  pound  of  balls. 
And  reckon  if  a  thousand  give  me  twenty  what  will  give  me  one :  and 
you  will  find  that  it  will  give  you  2%ooo  divisions  of  time  which  make 
about  /'50  of  time.  Now  if  one  shoots  with  powder  the  weight  of  a 
small  grain,  the  experiment  will  not  send  the  ball  farther  than  the 
mortar  sends  its  smoke  when  one  begins  to  fire,  and  by  this  reasoning 
it  would  be  sent  a  million  miles  in  the  time  when  the  thousand  pounds 
of  balls  go  three  miles.  You  investigators  therefore  should  not  trust 
yourselves  to  the  authors  who  by  employing  only  their  imagination 
have  wished  to  make  themselves  interpreters  between  nature  and  man, 
but  only  [to  the  guidance]  of  those  who  have  exercised  their  intellects 
not  with  the  signs  of  nature  but  with  the  results  of  their  experiments.

movable  thing  twice  as  swiftly.  This  does  not  appear  so  to  me,  for  the 
reason  that  he  does  not  take  into  account  that  this  power  exerts  its  ulti- 
mate force,  and  unless  it  did  this,  the  thing  which  weighed  less  would 
not  be  in  proportion  to  the  force  of  the  mover  or  of  the  medium 
through  which  it  has  passed.  Consequently  it  would  be  a  thing  floating 
in  the  wind  and  not  in  straight  movement,  and  it  would  go  less  far.

When  one  weight  falls  to  the  ground  at  the  same  time  as  another

Nothing  movable  will  ever  be  swifter  than  the  part  of  its  mover  that

Every  small  movement  made  by  the  movable  thing  surrounded  by 
air  maintains  itself  as  it  goes  by  impetus. 

A  movable  thing  moved  by  a  slow  mover,  if  it  has  to  move  a  thing

[With  diagrams] 

Why  every  substance  that  possesses  gravity  either  free  altogether  or 
in  part  shows  in  its  whole  or  in  part  the  natural  desire  to  descend. 

The  wheel  a  b  being  fixed  in  the  position  that  you  see,  the  heavy 
substance  a  will  descend  at  b\  and  below  for  this  reason  the  heavy  sub-

[Reflex  movements} 

The  reflex  movement  will  be  of  greater  strength  when  it  is  longer. 

And  that  reflex  movement  will  be  longer  which  is  produced  between 
more  diverse  angles. 

The  reflex  movement  which  is  longer  is  less  impeded  because  it 
differs  little  from  the  movement  of  percussion,  and  this  percussion  has 
little  strength  and  consequently  it  loses  little  of  the  power  of  its  first 
mover. 

But  if  the  reflex  movement  is  shorter  it  is  a  sign  that  it  is  more  im- 
peded at  the  place  of  the  percussion,  and  it  differs  much  from  the 
movement  of  incidence  and  consequently  the  power  of  the  first  move- 
ment is  greatly  diminished.  l  42  r. 

OF  PERCUSSION 

The  reflex  movement  will  be  as  much  weaker  as  it  is  shorter. 

That  reflex  movement  will  be  shorter  which  is  cause  by  a  greater 
percussion. 

That  percussion  will  be  of  greater  power  which  is  made  between 
more  equal  angles. 

Of  the  percussions  made  between  equal  angles  that  will  be  of  the 
greater  strength  which  is  caused  against  a  more  compact  object. 

And  in  the  percussions  made  on  objects  of  equal  compactness  that 
will  be  more  powerful  which  has  its  object  of  greater  resistance. 

The  spherical  body  turns  so  much  more  in  the  reflex  movement  as 
the  percussion  is  made  between  the  more  unequal  angles.         l  42  v. 

[Movement — cannonball} 

The  smoother  the  surface  of  the  cannonball  the  greater  the  ease  with 
which  it  will  turn  in  the  air  as  it  moves. 

In  a  proposition  of  this  kind  one  imagines  that  the  cannonball  shot 
from  the  mortar  has  to  turn  itself  in  the  air  which  it  compresses,  and 
if  this  cannonball  is  not  altogether  smooth  its  curve  may  occasion  diffi- 
culty in  friction  with  the  air  which  surrounds  it,  as  I  have  proved  in 
the  fourth  concerning  frictions. 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  567 

So  when  the  rebound  of  this  cannonball  is  made  at  a  more  obtuse 
angle  this  cannonball  will  turn  more  upon  itself;  and  if  the  ball  be 
lacking  in  smoothness  it  will  come  to  fail  in  speed  much  more  than  if 
it  was  smooth.  l  43  r. 

The  percussion  of  each  heavy  spherical  substance  will  not  occasion 
scars  which  have  between  them  a  proportion  resembling  that  of  the 
slant  of  the  places  where  they  strike. 

This  proposition  would  be  entirely  confirmed  by  experience  if  there 
were  not  the  firm  compression  of  the  air  driven  by  the  fury  of  the  ball, 
for  this  not  being  of  itself  swift  as  is  the  movement  by  the  mover  which 
drives  it  becomes  compressed,  and  is  the  more  compressed  as  it  is  the 
more  driven.  And  this  is  how  it  comes  about  that  this  ball  afterwards 
striking  by  a  line  that  is  not  central  within  the  range  of  the  perpendic- 
ular [line]  a  c  commences  the  first  stage  of  its  slant,  and  the  last  ends 
in  the  range  of  the  horizontal  [line]  a  b.  l  43  v.  and  44  r.

If  the  water  here  were  to  move  as  quickly  as  the  air  the  ship  would 
move  like  the  wind,  without  a  sail;  but  because  the  wind  is  swifter  high 
up  than  low  down  therefore  the  wind  has  more  power  on  the  sail  than 
on  the  water.  l  47  v.

RULE  OF  POWER 

If  a  power  move  a  weight  a  certain  space  in  a  certain  time,  the  half 
of  that  power  will  move  that  whole  body  the  half  of  that  space  in  the 
said  time,  or  all  the  space  in  double  the  time. 

Or  the  whole  of  that  power  will  move  a  weight  double  that  first 
weight  half  that  distance  in  the  same  time. 

Or  it  will  move  the  said  weight  in  half  the  said  time  half  the  space. 

L  78   V. 

Man  and  every  animal  undergoes  more  fatigue  in  going  upwards

as  he  descends  he  simply  lets  it  go.  l  84  v. 

That  body  will  show  itself  heaviest  which  meets  with  the  most  feeble

its  support.  l  85  v. 

The  centre  of  every  gravity  that  is  suspended  stands  below  the 
central  line  of  the  cord  that  sustains  it.

one  being  double  the  other  in  length,  as  regards  the  weight  and  be- 
cause these  cords  meet  in  the  same  spot  in  order  to  support  a  weight 
one  cord  will  feel  as  much  more  weight  than  the  other  as  it  is  longer 
than  the  other.  m  37  r.

Why  the  flat  sand  being  made  up  of  grains  dissimilar  in  shape  and 
size  the  water  that  flows  above  it  drives  these  grains  with  different 
strengths  of  movement: 

Just  as  the  bodies  differing  in  weight  and  shape  make  different  move- 
ments in  the  still  air  so  do  the  air  and  water  which  move  between 
bodies  at  rest.  And  this  is  the  reason  why  the  sand  loses  its  flatness 
through  the  movement  of  the  water  that  passes  over  it;  for  the  water 
that  is  moved  over  the  sand  performs  the  same  function  as  the  air  that 
is  moved  over  the  water.  And  if  one  should  prove  that  the  bottom  of 
the  flat  sand  makes  its  waves  and  becomes  uneven  through  the  uneven-

ness  of  its  granules,  and  that  this  uncvenness  cannot  occur  on  the  sur- 
Eace  of  the  water  which  is  smitten  and  is  of  uniform  body,  I  maintain 
that  the  air  is  full  of  parts  which  have  dissimilar  movement  and  there- 
fore there  is  no  uniformity  in  the  movement  of  the  parts  moved  by  the 
contact  of  the  air.  m  41  r.

it  shares  in  both  the  one  movement  and  the  other.

The  line  c  s  represents  the  movement  of  the  gravity  b  m  having  taken 
away  the  resistance  of  the  air  a  n. 

The  air  when  devoid  of  clouds  and  mist  starts  thick  at  its  base  and 
at  each  degree  of  its  height  it  acquires  in  the  form  of  a  pyramid  degrees 
of  thinness,  as  is  shown  by  the  line  n  a. 

And  the  weight  that  descends  through  this  air  also  in  each  stage  of 
its  movement  acquires  a  degree  of  speed,  although  I  ought  first  to  say 
that  with  every  degree  of  time  it  acquired  a  degree  of  movement  more 
than  the  degree  of  the  time  immediately  past.  This  is  why  I  suppose 
the  degrees  of  the  movement  to  be  ten  times  as  powerful  as  the  degrees 
of  the  air  that  resists;  consequently  we  may  say  that  the  said  ten  de- 
grees if  one  be  taken  away  for  the  air  which  offers  partial  resistance 
become  nine,  and  the  second  twenty  degrees  entering  into  the  denser 
air  has  two  taken  away  so  that  the  twenty  becomes  eighteen,  as  is 
shown  by  the  line  b  m.  m  43  r. 


570  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

[Of  weights  moving  through  the  air] 

If  two  equal  weights  are  situated  vertically  one  below  the  other  and 
allowed  to  fall  at  the  same  time  these  in  long  descent  will  consume 
their  interval  and  will  come  to  touch. 

When  the  air  is  without  mist  or  clouds  you  will  find  that  at  every 
degree  of  height  it  will  acquire  a  corresponding  degree  of  thinness. 
So  also  inversely  every  degree  lower  down  it  will  acquire  a  degree  of 
density.  And  this  is  why  if  two  equal  bodies  are  placed  one  below  the 
other  a  braccio's  space  apart,  that  is  they  are  attached  by  a  thread  and 
let  fall  together  in  a  long  movement  they  will  touch  because  the  one 
below  always  finds  itself  in  thicker  air  than  the  one  above  it;  and  be- 
sides this  the  first  has  the  hard  work  of  opening  the  air  and  making  the 
waves  in  it;  part  of  this  escapes  upwards  and  charging  strikes  with  its 
reflex  movement  against  the  second  body,  but  the  rest  of  the  air  above 
runs  to  fill  the  vacuum  which  exists  behind  this  body.  m  43  v. 

Proof  of  the  proportion  of  the  time  and  movement  together  with  the 
speed  made  in  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies  in  the  shape  of  a  pyramid, 
because  the  aforesaid  powers  are  all  pyramidal  seeing  that  they  com- 
mence in  nothing  and  proceed  to  increase  in  degrees  of  arithmetical 
proportion. 

If  you  cut  the  pyramid  at  any  stage  of  its  height  by  a  line  equidistant 
to  its  base,  you  will  find  that  whatever  proportion  there  be  between 
the  height  of  this  section  from  its  base  and  the  whole  height  of  the 
pyramid,  there  will  be  the  same  proportion  between  the  breadth  of  this 
section  and  the  breadth  of  the  whole  base.  m  44  r. 

This  happens  in  the  air  of  uniform  thickness. 

The  heavy  body  which  descends,  at  each  degree  of  time  acquires  a 
degree  of  movement  more  than  the  degree  of  the  time  preceding,  and 
similarly  a  degree  of  swiftness  greater  than  the  degree  of  the  preced- 
ing movement.  Therefore  at  each  doubled  quantity  of  time  the  length 
of  the  descent  is  doubled  and  also  the  swiftness  of  the  movement. 

It  is  here  shown  that  whatever  the  proportion  that  one  quantity  of 
time  has  with  another,  the  one  quantity  of  movement  will  have  the 
same  with  the  other  and  similarly  one  quantity  of  swiftness,    m  44  v. 

[Weight  in  the  air — increase  of  speed] 
The  heavy  body  which  descends  freely  with  every  degree  of  time 


MOVEMENT  AND   WEIGHT  571 

acquires  a  degree  of  movement,  and  with  every  degree  of  movement  it 
acquires  a  degree  of  speed. 

Although  the  equal  division  of  the  movement  of  time  cannot  be  in- 
dicated by  degrees  as  is  the  movement  made  by  the  bodies,  nevertheless 
the  necessity  of  the  case  constrains  me  to  ma/{e  degrees  after  the  man- 
ner in  which  they  are  made  among  musicians} 

Let  us  say  that  in  the  first  degree  of  time  it  [i.e.  the  heavy  body]  ac- 
quires a  degree  of  movement  and  a  degree  of  speed,  in  the  second  de- 
gree of  time  it  will  acquire  two  degrees  of  movement  and  two  of 
speed  and  so  it  continues  in  succession  as  has  been  said  above. 

m  45  r. 

[  Waves  of  the  air] 

The  wave  of  the  air  that  is  produced  by  means  of  a  body  which 
moves  through  this  air  will  be  considerably  swifter  than  the  body  that 
moves  it. 

What  is  set  forth  above  happens  because  as  the  body  of  the  air  is  very 
volatile  and  moves  very  easily  when  a  body  moves  through  it  it  comes 
to  make  the  first  wave  in  its  first  movement,  and  at  the  same  time  that 
wave  cannot  be  produced  without  it  causing  another  after  it  and  that 
another.  And  so  this  body  moving  through  the  air  creates  beneath  it  in 
each  stage  of  time  multiplications  of  waves,  which  in  their  flight  pre- 
pare the  path  of  movement  for  the  movement  of  their  mover. 

The  wave  of  the  air  forming  and  reforming  itself  prepares  the  way 
of  movement  for  its  mover. 

The  air  which  is  shut  up  by  force  becomes  heavier  than  that  which 
is  at  liberty.  m  45  v. 

[Weight  moving  through  the  air] 

The  heavy  body  which  has  a  free  descent  with  every  degree  of  move- 
ment acquires  a  degree  of  weight. 

This  arises  out  of  the  second  of  the  first  which  says  that  'that  body 
will  be  heavier  which  has  less  resistance'.  In  this  case  of  free  descent  of 
heavy  bodies  one  sees  clearly  by  the  example  already  cited  of  the  wave 
of  the  water,  that  the  air  makes  the  same  wave  beneath  the  thing  which 
descends,  because  it  finds  itself  pushed  and  drawn  from  the  opposite 
side,  that  is  that  it  makes  a  turning  wave  which  helps  to  drive  it  down.

572  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

Now  for  these  reasons  the  air  which  flies  in  front  of  the  weight  that 
drives  it  shows  clearly  that  it  does  not  resist  it  and  in  consequence  does 
not  impede  this  movement;  therefore  the  greater  the  descent  of  the 
wave  which  travels  more  rapidly  than  the  heavy  body  that  moves  it, 
the  longer  the  movement  of  this  heavy  body  continues;  and  as  the  last 
wave  becomes  more  remote  the  more  it  prepares  the  air  which  touches 
the  weight  to  a  more  facile  flight.  m  46  r. 

[Density  of  waves.  Weight  in  the  air] 

When  waves  become  divided  in  minute  particles  that  quantity  which 
above  is  united  and  powerful  comes  to  descend  to  the  ground. 

Things  that  fall  may  be  continuous  quantities  such  as  staffs,  beams 
and  suchlike  things,  and  liquid  bodies,  although  these  cease  to  be  con- 
tinuous when  their  descent  is  long. 

Others  are  discontinuous  such  as  stones  and  other  bodies  separated 
the  one  from  the  other.  Others  are  neuter  as  would  be  the  grain  from 
the  hopper  that  turns  the  mill,  sand,  and  similar  quantities  of  minute 
bodies  of  which  you  may  make  proof  at  a  great  height.  And  mark 
what  a  difference  there  is  between  the  unity  of  their  exit  from  the  hop- 
per and  their  density  when  they  arrive  at  the  place  of  their  percussion. 

If  the  air  were  of  uniform  thickness  at  each  part  of  its  height  the 
bodies  which  descend  would  acquire  at  each  stage  of  their  movement 
equal  degrees  of  speed.  m  46  v. 

[Weight.  Movement.  Waves  of  water] 

Now  we  have  found  that  the  discontinuous  quantity  when  moving 
acquires  at  each  stage  of  its  movement  a  degree  of  speed;  and  so  in 
each  stage  of  harmonic  time  they  acquire  a  length  of  space  from  each 
other,  and  this  acquisition  is  in  arithmetical  proportion. 

How  then  are  we  to  account  for  the  continuous  quantity  of  liquid 
bodies  in  their  descent,  since  in  each  interval  of  harmonic  time  it  pours 
out  the  same  weight  and  at  each  stage  of  movement  it  becomes  longer 
and  thinner,  so  that  in  a  long  course  it  shows  itself  ending  in  a  point 
as  does  the  pyramid;  consequently  such  liquid  body  would  not  fall  to 
earth,  but  it  would  rather  be  that  each  great  mass  of  this  body  would 
remain  in  the  air  even  though  it  should  be  a  very  great  river  which  was 
continually  rolling  away;  and  experience  shows  the  contrary;  for  as 
much  as  departs  above  strikes  at  the  same  time  below.  And  if  the  same 


MOVEMENT   AND   WEIGHT  573 

weight  of  this  liquid  body  makes  itself  thinner  it  meets  with  less  re- 
sistance from  the  air  and  consequently  acquires  speed;  and  if  by  being 
thinner  it  has  acquired  speed  this  same  weight  would  also  for  this 
second  reason  come  to  make  itself  longer  and  in  consequence  still  thin- 
ner and  so  would  descend  more  rapidly;  and  this  would  go  on  in  suc- 
cession to  infinity.  Therefore  either  nature  or  necessity  has  brought 
it  about  that  in  whatever  manner  the  descent  comes  to  assume  the 
form  of  a  pyramid,  it  makes  intersection  by  changing  its  extremities 
from  right  to  left  and  commences  to  divide  itself;  and  the  more  it 
descends  the  more  it  divides;  and  thus  with  many  ramifications  it 
comes  to  lighten  itself  and  to  check  its  irregular  movement.

If  two  bodies  of  equal  weight  and  the  same  shape  fall  one  after  the

[  Weight.  Increase  of  speed] 

The  heavy  thing  descending  freely  gains  a  degree  of  speed  with 
every  stage  of  movement. 

And  the  part  of  the  movement  which  is  made  in  each  degree  of  time 
is  always  longer  successively,  the  new  one  than  that  which  preceded  it. 

It  may  be  clearly  shown  that  what  is  set  forth  above  is  true,  for  dur- 
ing the  same  time  that  the  weight  a  descends  at  c,  b  which  finds  itself

You  will  proceed  by  the  rule  of  three  and  you  will  say  if  the  height 
of  the  pyramid  which  I  know  for  certain  to  be  s  c  gives  me  a  braccio 
for  its  base;  or  if  a  base  of  a  braccio  comes  from  a  pyramid  of  ten 
braccia,  what  will  another  base  of  sixty  five  braccia  come  from  ? 

There  arises  here  an  exception,  namely  that  if  a  ball  first  goes  up  a 
hundred  braccia  with  an  ounce  of  powder  it  goes  through  air  of 
greater  thickness  than  would  that  which  rose  three  thousand  braccia> 
and  consequently  as  that  of  the  said  three  thousand  braccia  has  been 
at  each  hundred  braccia  in  a  region  of  air  that  is  thinner  than  that 
before  it,  it  has  always  acquired  more  speed.

[Fall  of  heavy  bodies} 

If  many  bodies  of  similar  weight  and  shape  are  allowed  to  fall  one

will  be  equal  to  each  other. 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  575 

Demonstration 

By  the  fifth  of  the  first  which  says  how  the  thing  that  descends  at 
every  stage  of  movement  acquires  equal  degrees  of  speed. 

Therefore  for  this  reason  the  movement  of  the  last  downward  be- 
comes much  more  rapid  than  that  of  the  first  from  the  beginning. 

And  by  the  eighth  of  the  first  which  says  that:  the  upper  pair  will 
have  in  their  interval  the  same  proportion  with  the  interval  of  the 
lower  pair  as  the  speed  of  the  lower  pair  has  to  that  of  the  upper  pair, 
and  so  conversely  the  speed  with  the  distances  will  be  as  the  distances 
with  the  speed. 

The  experiment  of  the  aforesaid  conclusion  as  to  movement  ought 
to  be  made  in  this  way,  that  is  that  one  takes  two  balls  of  similar 
weight  and  shape  and  causes  them  to  drop  from  a  considerable  height 
in  such  a  way  that  at  the  inception  of  their  movement  they  touch  one 
another  and  that  whoever  is  making  the  experiment  stations  himself 
on  the  ground  in  order  to  watch  whether  at  the  time  of  their  fall  they 
have  remained  touching  each  other  or  no.  And  this  experiment  should 
be  made  many  times  so  that  no  accident  may  occur  to  hinder  or  falsify 
this  proof — for  the  experiment  might  be  false  whether  it  deceived  the 
investigator  or  no.  m  57  r.  and  v. 

OF  THE  RESISTANCE  OF  THE  AIR 

That  air  will  become  denser  which  is  pressed  upon  by  a  greater 
weight. 

Although  b  is  as  thick  as  a  yet  as  it  is  twice  as  heavy  it  makes  the  air 
which  flies  below  it  twice  as  dense,  and  as  it  becomes  denser  below  it 
becomes  proportionately  thinner  above.  m  58  r.

part  that  yields  against  the  object  as  though  it  were  pressing  upon  a 
spring,  or  with  a  part  which  yields  against  the  thing  that  strikes  the 
object  with  a  spring  or  which  jumps  upon  the  point  of  its  feet.

[Falls  of  heavy  bodies] 

Explanation  of  the  movement  of  the  separated  quantity. 

Why  the  natural  movement  of  heavy  things  at  each  stage  of  its 
descent  acquires  a  degree  of  speed. 

And  for  this  reason  such  movement  as  it  acquires  power  shows  itself 
of  pyramidal  shape,  because  the  pyramid  acquires  similarly  in  each  de- 
gree of  its  length  a  degree  of  breadth,  and  so  such  proportion  of  ac- 
quisition is  found  in  arithmetical  proportion  because  the  parts  that 
exceed  are  always  equal.  m  59  v. 

[Drawing: — two  balls] 

These  two  figures  are  double  in  diameter  the  one  of  the  other  and  I 
wish  to  know  how  much  the  one  descends  more  rapidly  than  the  other. 

[Drawing: — two  cubes  p  q\ 

Although  p  is  eight  times  q  nevertheless  it  is  not  swifter  in  its  descent 
than  about  the  double  of  q,  which  descent  will  be  spoken  of  here. 

Let  us  say  therefore  that  q  is  three  pounds  and  that  the  resistance  of 
the  air  is  a  pound;  consequently  the  weight  which  was  three  becomes 
two  and  consequently  of  the  weight  p  there  remains  two  pounds.  So 
of  the  four  dice  below  which  are  three  pounds  each  there  remain  eight 
pounds  and  those  above  are  twelve  pounds  and  this  makes  twenty  con- 
taining two  ten  times  and  so  becoming  ten  times  swifter.      m  60  r. 

If  two  balls  of  equal  weight  and  size  are  placed  at  a  distance  of  one 
braccio  one  above  the  other  and  commence  their  descent  at  the  same 
moment,  always  at  each  stage  of  movement  the  interval  between  them 
will  be  of  the  same  size  and  will  remain  as  shown  at  a  b. 

If  after  the  descent  of  a  braccio  made  by  one  ball  you  allow  another 
similar  one  to  fall  you  will  find  that  at  each  stage  of  movement  there 
will  be  a  proportionate  change  in  their  speed  and  force. 

It  is  clearly  shown  how  when  the  ball  has  fallen  from  a  to  c  it  has 
traversed  twice  the  distance  that  that  ball  has  which  has  fallen  only 
from  a  to  b,  and  therefore  it  will  be  twice  as  swift  and  powerful  and 
will  bury  itself  twice  as  deeply  as  at  b,  and  if  when  descending  or  in- 
deed when  a  has  descended  at  d,  b  shall  find  itself  at  c,  and  the  power 
of  d  will  not  be  more  than  double  that  of  c  but  will  be  half  as  much 
again.  And  so  when  a  is  at  e,  b  will  be  at  d  aad  the  power  of  d  will  be

[Projectiles] 

OF  MOVEMENT 

I  wish  to  know  what  weight  ought  to  be  that  of  lead  which  will  drive 
a  ball  of  a  pound  of  lead  a  greater  distance  from  itself  than  any  other 
weight  which  is  also  of  lead,  the  said  movers  having  also  the  same 
movement. 

And  I  wish  to  know  how  far  a  weight  equal  to  that  of  lead  being  of 
wood  will  drive  in  the  same  movement  from  itself  the  above-mentioned 
ball  of  lead. 

Among  weights  of  similar  shape  that  will  be  driven  to  a  greater  dis- 
tance by  the  same  power  which  finds  itself  smaller  in  shape. 

THE  CONVERSE 

Among  the  weights  of  like  shape  which  are  driven  by  the  same 
power  that  which  is  of  greater  bulk  will  be  of  less  movement. 

Aristotle  says  that  if  a  power  moves  a  body  a  certain  distance  in  a 
certain  time  the  same  power  will  move  half  this  body  twice  the  distance 
in  the  same  time.  Therefore  the  millionth  part  of  this  weight  will  be 
driven  by  the  same  power  a  million  times  this  distance  in  the  same 
time;  or  if  this  weight  was  an  ounce  and  it  was  transported  a  mile  in 
a  period  of  time  the  millionth  part  would  be  transported  a  million 
miles  in  the  same  period.  And  if  you  were  to  say  that  the  air  would 
make  resistance  I  maintain  that  in  proportion  as  this  body  was  less  in 
weight  than  an  ounce  the  quantity  of  air  would  be  less  that  withstood 
its  course.  m  61  v.  and  62  r.

OF  THE  POWER  OF  THE  CROSS-BOW 

The  weight  that  charges  the  cross-bow  has  the  same  proportion  to 
the  weight  of  the  arrow  as  the  movement  of  the  arrow  of  this  cross- 
bow has  to  the  movement  of  its  cord. 

Here  one  ought  to  deduct  three  resistances  made  by  the  air,  that  is 
the  percussion  of  the  bow  of  the  cross-bow  made  upon  the  air,  and 
that  of  the  cord;  the  third  is  that  made  against  the  arrow.  And  as  the 
cord  is  thicker  so  its  arrow  encompasses  it  the  less.  m  63  r.

The  force  of  the  wedge  is  very  great  because  of  the  percussion,  and 
it  acts  with  marvellous  power  in  dividing  the  things  united  and  in 
uniting  those  divided,  in  stamping  sculptures  of  metals  in  bas-relief,  in 
squeezing  out  the  liquids  from  the  places  where  they  are  produced,  and 
in  drying  things  that  are  moist,  as  well  as  in  many  other  things  as  will 
be  shown  when  treating  of  them;  although  it  has  the  same  nature  as 
the  screw  it  surpasses  it  altogether.  m  63  v. 

OF  WEDGES  THAT  ARE  PERMANENT 

Wedges  are  of  two  kinds  of  which  one  is  called  'permanent'  and  the 
other  'transitive'.  The  permanent  is  that  in  which  when  the  wedge  has 
entered  it  cannot  turn  back,  and  the  other  enters  and  departs  accord- 
ing to  the  necessity  of  the  case.

[Movements  of  water  and  of  sand]

where  thick  and  where  thin,  where  pure  and  where  mingled  with 
various  particles  of  straw-wood  and  leaves. 

Water  falls  from  its  heights  and  where  it  makes  the  greatest  per- 
cussion it  removes  the  things  which  are  heaviest  and  fitted  for  resist- 
ance; and  after  this  percussion  it  carries  the  heaviest  things  by  the  cur- 
rent that  is  greater  and  swifter,  and  so  conversely  it  carries  the  lighter 
things  in  the  part  of  the  water  that  is  slower  and  has  less  power.

I  ask  where  the  water  leaves  its  muddy  banks,  where  mixed  with 
sand  and  where  thin  and  fine  so  that  it  slips  away  and  where  mixed

We  shall  speak  of  the  cause  of  the  movement  that  the  sand  makes 
upon  its  bed  and  what  carries  it  off  and  how  it  moves  and  where  and 
how  it  stops,  and  also  of  the  small  and  large  stones  and  how  they  group 
themselves  when  they  stop  all  together  and  also  of  every  other  thing 
that  goes  rolling  upon  its  bed.  m  65  r. 

{Relations  of  surfaces] 

If  two  surfaces  of  different  shapes  and  equal  circumferences  touch

[Movements  of  water  and  of  sand] 

These  waves  of  the  sand  are  changeable  together  according  to  the

The  water  that  is  swifter  is  that  which  wears  away  the  bed  of  the 
rivers  most.  Hence  it  comes  about  how  when  the  sand  forms  those 
shells,  or  after  the  manner  of  certain  undulations  it  is  seen  on  the  sur- 
face of  the  water,  how  the  sand  moved  by  the  greater  current  of  the 
water  becomes  more  sifted.

If  the  cord  of  the  cross-bow  draws  four  hundred  pounds  weight 
upon  its  notch  with  the  movement  of  a  third  of  a  braccio,  as  it  dis- 
charges itself  it  will  draw  two  hundred  pounds  with  two  thirds  of  a 
braccio  distance  from  its  notch,  and  a  hundred  pounds  will  be  removed 
from  its  position  by  such  power  for  a  space  of  one  braccio  and  a  third. 

And  so  as  much  as  you  shall  diminish  the  weight  of  the  movable 
thing  so  the  power  will  cause  it  to  make  a  greater  movement,  in  such  a 
way  that  you  will  always  find  that  the  movement  of  the  cord  and  the 
movement  of  the  thing  moved  will  be  in  the  same  proportion  as  the 
weight  that  drew  the  cord  to  the  notch  was  to  the  weight  that  was 
driven  by  the  cord  (if  the  air  did  not  restrain  it).  m  71  v. 

A  bow  bends  half  a  braccio  and  has  power  of  one  hundred  and  pulls

arrows?  m  72  r. 


RULE  OF  THE  PROPORTION  OF  REBOUNDS 

If  you  twist  the  cord  n  m  twenty  times  it  will  uncoil  and  make 
thirty  nine  revolutions  in  the  contrary  direction,  and  will  then  roll  the 
opposite  way  and  will  make  thirty-eight;  and  so  in  succession  it  will 
go  on  diminishing  in  arithmetical  proportion  until  its  movement 
ceases. 

The  length  of  the  first  turn  will  bear  the  same  proportion  to  the 
second  as  the  first  right  twist  has  to  that  of  the  left.  m  72  v.

forth  which  may  be  guided  upwards  somewhat  by  the  edges  of  its 
tube,  it  will  spout  up  in  as  great  force  issuing  by  a  narrow  tube  as  by 
a  thick  one,  because  the  water  as  it  issues  forth  in  a  thin  stream  is 
driven  by  the  thin  part  that  is  in  the  reservoir,  and  the  thick  part  will 
be  guided  and  driven  by  the  thick  part  which  is  likewise  in  the  said 
reservoir.  m  73  r. 

[Movement  and  weight.  Cross-bow] 

OF  MOVEMENT 

The  length  of  the  movement  made  by  the  thing  driven  by  the 
cross-bow  will  have  the  same  proportion  with  the  movement  of  its 
cord  as  that  of  the  weight  driven  to  the  weight  that  loads  the  said 
cross-bow. 

A  b  is  the  movement  made  by  the  cord  of  the  cross-bow  when  it  is 
laden  and  acquires  its  force. 

B  c  is  the  contrary  movement  which  the  cord  makes  when  it  loses 
its  force,  and  there  is  the  same  proportion  between  the  movement  that 
the  cord  makes  in  acquiring  force  and  the  movement  made  by  the 
death  of  the  force,  as  between  the  weight  driven  and  the  weight  that  is 
the  creator  of  the  force.  m  73  v. 


582  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

If  a  weight  moves  the  cord  of  the  cross-bow  as  far  as  its  notch,  the 
half  of  this  weight  will  pass  the  half  of  the  movement  of  such  cord, 
and  five  sevenths  of  the  weight  will  create  three  quarters  of  the  move- 
ment of  the  cord  towards  the  notch. 

Now  in  order  to  give  a  uniform  weight  to  the  movement  of  the 
cord  which  as  it  slackens  diminishes  its  degrees  of  force  with  each  de- 
gree of  movement,  you  take  away  the  half  of  the  force;  thus  if  it  was 
four  hundred  in  the  beginning  and  in  the  last  stage  nothing,  take  the 
half  of  the  pyramidal  force  which  was  two  hundred  and  calculate  with 
the  weight  of  the  arrow.      '  m  74  r. 

OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  THE  ARROW 

Although  the  force  of  the  cross-bow  is  great  at  the  beginning  and 
nothing  in  the  last  stage,  nevertheless  the  movement  of  the  cord 
through  the  impetus  acquired  makes  itself  swifter  towards  the  end 
than  at  the  beginning  of  its  movement:  wherefore  we  conclude  that 
the  arrow  goes  to  the  end  of  the  movement  of  the  cord.         m  74  v. 

[Of  the  power  of  percussion] 

Many  small  blows  cause  the  nail  to  enter  into  the  wood,  but  if  you 
join  these  blows  together  in  one  single  blow  it  will  have  much  more 
power  than  it  had  separately  in  its  parts.  But  if  a  power  of  percussion 
drives  a  nail  entirely  into  a  piece  of  wood  this  same  power  can  be 
divided  into  ever  so  many  parts,  and  though  the  percussion  of  these 
occur  on  the  nail  for  a  long  time  they  can  never  penetrate  to  any  extent 
in  the  said  wood. 

If  a  ten-pound  hammer  drives  a  nail  into  a  piece  of  wood  with  one 
blow,  a  hammer  of  one  pound  will  not  drive  the  nail  altogether  into 
the  wood  in  ten  blows.  Nor  will  a  nail  that  is  less  than  the  tenth  part 
[of  the  first]  be  buried  more  deeply  by  the  said  hammer  of  a  pound 
in  a  single  blow  although  it  may  be  in  equal  proportions  to  the  first 
named,  because  what  is  lacking  is  that  the  hardness  of  the  wood  does 
not  diminish  the  proportion  of  its  resistance,  that  is  that  it  is  as  hard 
as  at  first. 

If  you  wish  to  treat  of  the  proportions  of  the  movement  of  the 
things  that  have  penetrated  into  the  wood  when  driven  by  the  power 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  583

[Weight  of  pyramid] 

If  you  wish  to  divide  the  pyramid  in  two  equal  weights  divide  it 
lengthwise  into  four  parts  and  join  together  the  quarter  towards  the 
apex  and  the  quarter  towards  the  base;  these  two  parts  joined  together 
will  be  equal  in  weight  and  quantity  to  the  two  centre  parts;  that  is 
that  one  common  measure  will  measure  them  precisely,  as  is  shown

[Movement — cross-bow] 

Of  the  movement  made  in  such  manner  that  the  mover  ends  its 
course  before  the  cord  remains  drawn: 

This  movement  will  be  of  like  power  to  that  which  is  made  by  the 
cord  which  remains  drawn  when  the  arrow  passes  out  of  the  cross- 
bow, provided  that  the  mover  finishes  its  course  in  pyramidal  power, 
that  is  great  at  the  beginning  and  finishes  in  nothing.  The  movement 
of  the  arrow  however  which  is  great  at  the  beginning  and  also 
ends  in  nothing  preserves  the  length  of  its  power  of  movement  more 
than  the  cord  does,  seeing  that  its  movement  was  capable  of  being  of 
the  length  of  four  hundred  braccia  and  the  movement  of  the  cord 
which  drove  this  arrow  was  capable  only  of  a  third  of  a  braccio.

Pyramid  of  the  power  and  movement  of  the  mover. 

Pyramid  of  the  power  and  movement  of  the  thing  moved. 

If  the  cord  of  the  cross-bow  after  the  flight  that  it  has  given  to  the 
arrow  remains  curved,  it  is  certain  that  its  power  at  each  degree  of 
movement  has  acquired  degrees  of  slowness  and  infinite  weakness; 
consequently  we  may  say  such  power  to  be  pyramidal  because  it  com- 
mences at  the  base  and  ends  in  a  point. 

The  arrow  also  being  driven  by  the  cord  of  the  cross-bow  is  pyra- 
midal, because  at  each  degree  of  movement  it  acquires  degrees  of  slow- 
ness and  feebleness;  but  because  this  pyramid  is  longer  than  that  of  its 
mover,  the  arrow  has  parted  from  the  cord  before  this  cord  has  stopped; 
even  when  its  mover  was  in  its  greatest  power.  m  90  r.  and  v.

|  Weight  and  counterpoise.  Cross-bow] 

Experiment 

Here  one  ought  to  experiment  upon  the  same  counterpoise  and  with 
the  same  fall  of  this  counterpoise,  with  different  weights  of  its  mover 
and  different  shapes,  and  see  first  what  weight  being  of  spherical  shape 
will  be  that  which  will  be  driven  to  a  greater  distance  from  its  mover 
than  any  other.  In  addition  to  this  when  you  have  found  what  this 
weight  will  be,  which  as  I  have  said  is  spherical  in  shape,  you  will  then 
prove  how  the  weight  of  this  movable  thing  varies  in  length  and  is 
equipped  with  feathers  after  the  fashion  of  an  arrow.  And  further 
such  shape  of  arrow  while  of  the  same  weight  may  be  made  of  differ- 
ent substances  heavier  or  lighter  in  themselves.  And  where  such  a 
shape  stops  in  proportion  to  the  power  of  its  mover,  it  may  then  be 
tried  by  experiment  whether  the  movement  of  its  mover  is  increased 
if  the  movement  made  by  the  thing  moved  becomes  longer  or  shorter, 
although  this  experiment  ought  first  to  be  made  whilst  the  movable 
thing  is  of  spherical  shape. 

And  remember  the  means  which  are  made  use  of  between  the 
mover  and  the  thing  moved,  that  is  the  weight  of  the  instrument  and 
the  other  things.  m  91  r.  and  v.

Water 

Here  the  thing  moved  can  never  be  less  rapid  than  the  movement 
made  by  its  mover.  In  effect  if  the  thing  moved  had  movement  equal 
to  that  of  its  mover  the  mover  could  not  make  percussion  with  it,  and 
would  only  be  able  to  move  as  much  weight  as  was  equal  to  as  much 
of  the  water  as  follows  the  movement  of  the  wave  that  drives  it.

MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  585 

1  Counterpoise  and  cross-bow] 

OF  THE  MOVER  OF  POWER  CAPABLE  OF  BEING  INCREASED 

This  movement  is  the  contrary  to  that  of  the  cross-bow  seeing  that 
the  mover  of  this  acquires  at  every  stage  of  movement  degrees  of  im- 
petus, and  the  cross-bow  does  the  opposite  because  its  cord  commences 
in  its  force  and  ends  in  nothing,  whereas  the  counterpoise  as  it  falls 
commences  in  nothing  and  ends  in  great  power. 

Now  one  understands  here  that  with  the  great  movement  that  the 
cord  of  the  cross-bow  makes  at  the  commencement  of  its  movement, 
the  arrow  which  is  moved  by  this  impetus  does  not  slacken  its  move- 
ment at  the  same  time  as  does  that  of  the  cord;  on  the  contrary  it  fol- 
lows the  quality  of  the  first  speed  and  comes  to  separate  itself  from  the 
cord  before  this  cord  has  finished  its  movement. 

And  the  thing  driven  by  the  counterpoise  does  the  opposite,  for  as  it 
commences  slowly  and  ends  with  great  impetus  it  will  never  be  able  to 
separate  itself  as  does  the  cross-bow,  that  is  to  say  the  thing  moved, 
until  such  mover  has  finished  its  own  course.  m  92  v.  and  93  r. 


[Cross-bow] 

OF  THE  MOVER  OF  DIMINISHING  POWER 

If  a  weight  of  four  hundred  pounds  draws  the  cord  of  the  cross- 
bow over  the  notch  the  cord  has  the  force  of  four  hundred  pounds  and 
as  it  slackens  it  ends  in  nothingness. 

And  this  diminution  of  force  comes  about  by  stages  after  the  man- 
ner of  a  pyramid  of  which  the  projecting  parts  are  equal;  consequently 
we  may  say  that  the  centre  of  this  pyramid  is  that  which  may  be  called 
the  centre  of  the  force,  as  the  nature  of  its  weight  acts  in  the  simple  staff, 
in  which  if  one  takes  its  centre  one  will  find  the  weight  of  the  whole 
taking  in  the  same  way  the  centre  of  the  rise  of  the  cord  of  the  cross- 
bow. And  measuring  the  weight  which  draws  the  said  cord  in  this  posi- 
tion, one  will  find  that  this  weight  is  equal  to  the  weight  of  all  the  ar- 
rows which  could  be  stretched  along  the  length  of  the  movement  that 
the  arrow  makes  when  drawn  from  the  notch  of  the  cross-bow  on  its 
last  course.  And  if  this  arrow  were  long  and  thin  or  short  and  thick

or  if  it  was  a  ball  of  lead  consider  how  you  ought  to  measure  it  in  the 
whole  route  of  its  course.  Think  about  this  and  make  a  general  rule 
for  it  because  it  is  a  matter  that  requires  consideration.

Excessive  force  against  a  like  resistance  profits  the  projectile  noth- 
ing. But  if  the  force  of  the  mover  should  find  itself  in  proportion  to  its 
projectile  the  movement  made  by  the  projectile  will  be  in  the  first  stage 
of  its  strength.  It  is  as  though  I  were  to  attempt  to  draw  a  bladder  filled 
with  wind  against  the  air;  for  if  this  were  moved  by  excessive  force  the 
air  where  it  strikes  would  make  such  resistance  through  its  becoming 
compressed  that  the  bladder  striking  upon  it  there  would  leap  back  just 
as  though  it  had  been  driven  against  a  wall.  But  if  this  bladder  were 
moved  by  a  motive  power  proportionate  in  force  and  movement  to  the 
lightness  of  the  said  projectile,  then  this  projectile  will  advance  as  far 
forward  as  its  power  enables  it  to  drive  slowly  before  it  the  air  that 
withstands  its  course.  b.m.  54  r. 

There  are  two  different  kinds  of  percussions,  simple  and  complex. 
Simple  is  that  made  by  the  movable  thing  in  its  falling  movement 
upon  its  object.  Complex  is  the  name  given  when  this  first  percussion 
passes  beyond  the  resistance  of  the  object  which  it  strikes  first,  as  in  the 
blow  given  to  the  sculptor's  chisel  which  is  afterwards  transferred  to 
the  marble  that  he  is  carving.  This  blow  also  is  divided  into  two  others, 
namely  a  simple  and  a  double  blow.  The  simple  blow  has  been  suffi- 
ciently described:  the  double  is  that  that  occurs  when  the  hammer 
descends  with  force  in  its  natural  movement  and  flies  back  rebounding 
from  the  greater  blow  and  then  creates  an  inferior  blow  and  makes  this 
percussion  in  two  places  with  the  two  opposite  sides  of  the  hammer. 
And  this  blow  grows  less  and  less  in  proportion  to  the  number  of  the 
obstacles  which  are  interposed  between  it  and  the  final  resistance,  just 
as  if  someone  were  to  strike  a  book  on  its  front  page  when  they  were 
all  touching,  the  last  page  would  feel  the  damage  very  slightly.

All  movements  are  caused  by  abundance  or  dearth,  and  where  there 
is  the  greater  excess  there  the  movement  will  be  greater,      b.m.  132  r. 

Movements  are  of  two  kinds,  of  which  one  is  called  simple  and  the 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  587 

cither  composite.  The  simple  is  divided  into  two  parts,  and  the  one  is 
when  the  body  moves  round  its  axis  without  change  of  position,  as  the 
wheel  or  millstone  or  things  like  these;  the  second  is  when  the  thing 
moves  from  its  position  without  any  revolution  of  itself.1  The  com- 
posite movement  is  that  which  in  addition  to  moving  from  its  position 
also  moves  round  its  axis,  as  the  movement  of  the  wheels  of  a  waggon 
or  other  similar  things. 

Circular  movements  are  of  two  kinds  of  which  one  is  called  simple 
and  the  other  composite.  b.m.  140  v. 

The  straightness  of  the  transverse  movement  continues  in  the  mov- 
able thing  as  long  as  the  whole  of  the  power  given  to  it  by  its  mover 
continues. 

The  straightness  fails  in  the  transverse  movement  because  the  power 
which  the  movable  thing  acquires  from  its  mover  becomes  less. 

b.m.  147  v. 

Force  is  produced  by  dearth  or  profusion.  It  is  the  child  of  material 
movement,  the  grandchild  of  spiritual  movement,  the  mother  and 
source  of  gravity.  This  gravity  is  confined  within  the  element  of  water 
and  of  earth,  and  this  force  is  infinite,  for  by  means  of  it  infinite 
worlds  could  be  set  in  motion  if  it  were  possible  to  make  the  instru- 
ments by  which  this  force  could  be  produced. 

Force  with  material  movement  and  weight  with  percussion  are  the 
four  accidental  powers  in  which  all  the  works  of  mortals  have  their 
being  and  their  end. 

Force  has  its  origin  in  spiritual  movement  which  courses  through  the 
limbs  of  sentient  animals  thickening  their  muscles,  and  by  this  process 
of  thickening  the  muscles  become  contracted  and  so  draw  back  the 
tendons  which  are  connected  with  them,  and  from  this  originates  the 
force  that  exists  in  men's  limbs. 

The  quality  and  quantity  of  the  force  in  a  man  will  have  the  power 
of  giving  birth  to  other  force,  and  this  will  be  proportionately  so  much 
the  greater  according  as  the  movement  of  the  one  is  longer  than  that 
of  the  other.  b.m.  151  r. 

Gravity  and  force  together  with  material  movement  and  percussion 
are  the  four  accidental  powers  by  which  the  human  race  in  its  marvel- 

1  Note  in  margin,  'progressive  movement'. 


588  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

lous  and  varied  works  seems  to  reveal  itself  as  a  second  nature  in  this 
world;  seeing  that  by  the  use  of  such  powers  all  the  visible  works  of 
mortals  have  their  existence  and  their  death. 

Gravity  is  a  power  created  by  movement  which  transports  one  ele- 
ment into  another  by  means  of  force,  and  this  gravity  has  as  much  life 
as  is  the  effort  made  by  this  element  to  regain  its  native  place. 

Force  and  gravity  have  much  in  common  in  all  their  powers,  differ- 
ing only  in  the  movements  of  their  birth  and  death.  For  simple  gravity 
merely  dies,  that  is  as  it  approaches  its  centre.  But  force  is  born  and 
dies  in  every  movement. 

The  spirit  of  the  sentient  animals  moves  through  the  limbs  of  their 
bodies,  and  when  it  finds  that  the  muscles  in  those  it  has  entered  are 
responsive,  it  sets  itself  to  enlarge  them;  and  as  soon  as  they  enlarge 
they  shorten  and  in  shortening  draw  back  the  tendons  which  are 
joined  to  them.  And  from  this  arises  the  force  and  movement  of  hu- 
man limbs.  Consequently  material  movement  springs  from  spiritual. 

b.m.  151  v. 

No  element  possesses  gravity  or  levity  in  its  natural  state.  Gravity 
and  levity  are  caused  by  one  element  being  drawn  into  another. 

When  an  equal  quantity  of  elements  naturally  contiguous  have  ex- 
changed places  they  will  offer  an  equal  amount  of  resistance  one  to 
another.  b.m.  174  v. 

Weight  descends  for  lack  of  resistance  and  that  resistance  which  is 
weak  gives  way  before  it  more  speedily.  b.m.  175  v. 

No  movement  can  ever  be  so  slow  that  a  moment  of  stability  is  found 
in  it. 

That  movement  is  slower  which  covers  less  distance  in  the  same  time. 

That  movement  is  swifter  which  covers  a  greater  distance  in  the 
same  time. 

Movement  can  extend  to  infinite  degrees  of  slowness. 

And  the  power  of  the  movement  can  extend  to  infinite  degrees  of 
slowness  and  likewise  to  infinite  degrees  of  swiftness.       b.m.  176  v. 

No  element  possesses  weight  within  its  sphere,  and  when  by  chance 
an  element  passes  over  into  a  lighter  one  it  instantly  creates  gravity; 


MOVEMENT   AND   WEIGHT  589 

aiu\  not  being  able  to  be  supported  there  it  falls  back  again  into  its  own 
element,  and  there  immediately  this  gravity  dies. 

Gravity  and  force  which  are  interchangeably  daughters  and  mother 
of  motion  and  sisters  of  impetus  and  percussion  are  always  fighting 
against  their  cause;  and  after  this  has  been  subdued  they  conquer 
themselves  and  die. 

Gravity  is  a  particular  action  which  takes  place  when  one  element  is 
drawn  into  another  and  not  being  able  to  be  received  there  attempts 
with  perpetual  combat  to  return  to  its  own  place. 

Gravity  is  a  particular  fortuitous  action  of  one  element  when  drawn 
into  another;  it  has  as  much  life  as  there  is  desire  in  these  elements  to 
return  to  their  own  place. 

That  which  moves  towards  the  centre  is  termed  weight  and  that 
which  flies  from  it  is  termed  lightness;  but  each  is  of  equal  power  and 
life  and  movement.  b.m.  181  r. 

Every  heavy  body  desires  to  lose  its  heaviness  .  .  . 

Gravity,  force,  together  with  percussion,  are  to  be  spoken  of  as 
producers  of  movement  as  well  as  being  produced  by  it. 

Of  these  three  fortuitous  powers  two  have  in  their  birth,  their  desire 
and  their  end  one  and  the  same  nature.  b.m.  184  v. 

Of  the  things  that  support  themselves  without  movement  in  the 
water  no  part  that  is  above  the  water  has  weight  of  itself.  This  is 
proved  as  follows:  if  neither  the  still  water  has  weight  of  itself  nor 
the  things  supported  by  it,  and  it  is  proved  by  the  passage  that  its 
weight  is  wanting  and  also  the  weight  of  the  water,  how  then  can  we 
suppose  that  the  motionless  water  which  is  without  weight  should 
support  the  weight?  And  if  it  supports  the  bodies  it  does  not  support 
their  weight  which  has  been  consumed,  for  this  weight  is  ended  with 
the  movement  of  the  penetration  which  it  made  in  this  water. 

b.m.  267  v. 

When  anyone  wishes  to  make  a  bow  carry  a  very  long  way  he  should 
draw  himself  right  up  on  one  foot  raising  the  other  so  far  from  it  as  to 
create  the  necessary  balance  for  his  body  which  is  thrown  forward  on 
the  first  foot,  and  he  should  not  have  his  arm  fully  extended;  and  so 
that  he  may  be  better  equipped  for  the  hard  work  he  should  fit  to  the 


590  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

bow  a  piece  of  wood  which  as  used  in  cross-bows  should  go  from  the 
hand  to  the  breast,  and  when  he  wishes  to  discharge  the  arrow,  instantly 
at  the  same  time  he  should  leap  forward  and  extend  the  arm  that  holds 
the  bow  and  release  the  cord.  And  if  by  dexterity  he  does  all  this  at  the 
same  moment  it  will  travel  a  very  long  way. 

The  reason  given  for  this  is  as  follows: — know  that  as  the  leap  for- 
ward is  swift  it  lends  a  degree  of  fury  to  the  arrow,  and  the  extending 
of  the  arm  because  it  is  swifter  lends  a  second;  the  driving  of  the  cord 
being  also  more  swift  gives  a  third.  If  the  other  arrows  therefore  are 
driven  by  three  degrees  of  fury  and  this  by  the  dexterity  shown  is 
driven  by  six  it  ought  to  travel  double  the  distance.  And  I  would  re- 
mind you  that  you  leave  the  bow  relaxed,  so  that  it  will  spring  forward 
and  remain  taut.  Forster  i  44  r. 

CONCERNING  WEIGHTS 

If  there  are  two  men  who  hold  a  sheet  by  its  borders  in  which  sheet 
there  is  a  man  who  weighs  two  hundred  pounds,  and  each  pulls  his 
end  so  much  that  the  weight  does  not  touch  the  ground,  know  that 
each  of  those  who  are  pulling  is  holding  up  a  weight  as  great  as  the 
man  weighs  who  is  in  the  middle,  because  he  supports  half  the  weight 
of  the  man  in  the  centre  and  half  that  of  the  man  opposite  who  is  pull- 
ing, so  it  appears  that  the  weight  in  the  centre  being  two  hundred 
pounds  since  each  of  those  pulling  has  two  hundred  becomes  four  hun- 
dred pounds.  Forster  1  48  v. 

OF  MOVEMENT 

Every  movement  born  of  movement  which  is  free  either  divagates  or 
preserves  the  line  of  the  movement  which  produces  it,  except  the 
thunderbolt  which  descends  from  the  clouds. 

For  what  reason  does  the  club  give  a  greater  blow  and  moves  more 
than  the  stone?  Forster  11  32  r. 

If  a  man  with  his  whole  strength  throws  a  stone  of  four  pounds 
twenty  braccia,  one  of  one  pound  would  he  throw  it  eighty  (MS.  eight) 
braccia  or  no?  One  of  half  a  pound  would  he  throw  it  one  hundred 
and  sixty  braccia  (MS.  pounds)  or  no?  And  if  he  does  not  throw  these 
to  such  a  distance  what  is  the  cause?  Forster  11  33  v.

with  the  opposite  counterpoise  and  you  throw  your  arms  up  furiously. 
holding  two  weights  in  your  hands,  I  am  in  doubt  whether  your  weight 
would  become  light  or  heavy:  light  I  said;  by  the  movement  made  by 
its  extremities  it  would  wish  to  follow  the  impetus  commenced,  where- 
fore it  uproots  the  weight  and  seems  to  lighten  the  man;  also  one  may 
say  that  the  air  where  the  arms  strike  in  its  resistance  may  make  heavi- 
ness after  the  manner  of  the  jumper  who  presses  down  the  ground  at 
the  beginning  of  his  jump.  Forster  n  45  r.

I  say  that  the  resistance  of  the  air  will  not  allow  the  movement  to  be 
in  the  sixteenth  proportion,  and  this  experiment  may  be  made  upon 
fine  mud  of  uniform  fluidity  by  dropping  two  pieces  of  draw-plate  iron 
into  it  of  sixteen  and  of  one.  Forster  11  48  v. 

A  man  in  running  throws  less  of  his  weight  on  his  legs  than  if  he  is 
standing  still.  And  in  like  manner  the  horse  when  running  is  less  con- 
scious of  the  weight  of  the  man  whom  he  is  carrying;  consequently 
many  look  upon  it  as  marvellous  that  when  a  horse  is  in  a  race  it  can 
support  itself  upon  one  foot  only.  Therefore  we  may  say  as  regards 
weight  in  transverse  movement  that  the  swifter  this  is  the  less  it  weighs 
perpendicularly  towards  the  centre  [of  the  earth].        Forster  11  50  v. 

The  wheel  as  it  turns  upon  its  axle  causes  part  of  the  axle  to  become 
lighter  and  the  other  heavier  even  more  than  double  of  what  it  was  at 
first,  not  being  able  to  move  away  from  its  position.      Forster  11  51  r. 

By  the  law  of  the  balance  mathematically  an  infinite  weight  is  raised.

592  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

If  the  cross-bow  or  other  engine  drives  a  hundred  braccia  from  itself 
a  movable  thing  of  a  pound  which  has  one  degree  of  size,  how  far  will 
it  drive  a  pound  of  half  a  degree  of  size?  And  then  of  a  quarter  and 
then  of  an  eighth.  Forster  n  57  v. 

CONCERNING  MOVEMENT 

The  centre  of  the  world  is  indivisible,  therefore  nothing  alone  being 
indivisible  the  centre  is  equal  to  nothing.  And  if  one  should  make  a 
hole  which  was  with  its  diameter  or  indeed  its  centre  the  diameter  of 
the  world,  and  there  were  thrown  there  a  weight,  the  more  it  were  to 
move  the  greater  would  its  weight  become. 

So  having  arrived  at  the  centre  of  the  earth  which  has  only  the  name 
and  it  being  itself  equal  to  nothing,  the  weight  thrown  would  not  find 
any  resistance  at  this  centre  but  would  rather  pass  and  then  return. 

Forster  11  59  v. 

Every  heavy  thing  which  descends  freely  directs  its  course  to  the 
centre  of  the  world;  and  that  which  has  most  weight  descends  most 
rapidly  and  the  more  it  descends  the  more  it  becomes  swift. 

[Sketch — ship  in  water] 

The  water  that  is  moved  from  its  place  by  reason  of  the  ship  weighs 
as  much  as  the  actual  weight  of  this  ship  exactly.  Forster  11  65  v. 

[Diagram] 

If  two  cords  support  the  same  weight  and  are  not  equal  in  per- 
pendicular or  slant  they  will  not  be  equally  burdened  by  this  weight, 
but  the  one  will  receive  so  much  more  of  the  weight  than  the  other  as 
the  one  is  shorter  than  the  other  and  as  the  angles  made  by  the  line  of 
the  cords  and  by  the  beam  above  to  which  they  are  fixed  are  greater 
the  one  than  the  other.  Forster  11  67  v.

of  equal  size  of  different  substances,  and  keep  them  mixed  or  as  chance 
will  have  it,  and  see  at  the  end  of  the  movement  what  position  each  has 
chosen.

shorter  course  and  less  percussion  than  that  which  is  shot  through  the 
pure  thin  air;  but  it  will  make  a  considerably  louder  report. 

I  believe  also  that  the  arrow  shot  slanting  into  water  twists  as  does 
the  line  of  sight;  and  of  this  I  will  make  a  proof  by  fixing  the  bow  and 
shooting  in  a  frame  upon  which  a  sheet  of  paper  is  stretched,  this 
paper  being  over  the  water;  and  after  you  have  shot  on  this  paper 
without  moving  the  bow  or  the  sheet  of  paper  take  away  the  water 
And  you  will  discover  the  arrow,  and  by  means  of  a  thin  line  you  will 
be  able  to  discern  if  the  shaft  of  the  cross-bow  and  the  centre  of  the 
hole  made  in  the  paper  and  the  length  of  the  arrow  are  in  the  same 
line  or  no;  and  by  this  means  you  will  make  your  general  rule. 

Forster  11  69  v. 

If  many  bodies  of  equal  weight  and  shape  are  allowed  to  drop  one 
after  another  at  equal  intervals  of  time  from  the  same  altitude  in  such  a 
way  that  there  may  always  be  one  quantity  in  the  air,  I  say  that  the 
spaces  between  them  will  be  equal. 

If  each  thing  that  descends  at  every  stage  of  movement  acquires  a 
stage  of  speed,  we  may  say:  a  to  descend  to  b  in  six  intervals  of  time, 
and  b  to  c  in  five  intervals,  and  c  to  d  in  four,  and  d  to  e  in  three,  and 
e  to  /  in  two,  and  /  to  g\  and  thus  the  excesses  are  equal.  It  is  necessary 
therefore  that  as  many  touch  the  ground  as  start  above  with  equal  time. 

Forster  n  70  v. 

Whatever  the  proportion  of  the  number  of  the  cords  placed  in  the 
pulley-blocks  which  draw  the  weight  to  those  which  sustain  this 
weight,  such  is  that  of  the  weight  that  moves  to  that  which  is  moved. 

Whatever  the  proportion  of  the  number  of  the  cords  placed  in  the 
pulley-blocks,  which  pass  through  the  pulley-block  of  the  weight,  to 
those  which  sustain  this  weight,  such  is  that  of  the  gravity  suspended 
to  the  weight  which  sustains  it. 

As  many  as  are  the  wheels  of  the  pulley-block,  so  many  times  the 
mover  offers  resistance  of  itself  and  this  on  one  side  only. 

Forster  n  72  v. 

When  the  two  ends  of  the  cord  which  go  out  of  the  pulley  are 


594  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

situated  equally  the  power  of  the  mover  will  be  as  that  of  its  re- 
sistance. 

In  proportion  as  the  nature  of  the  positions  which  the  cords  assume 
as  they  issue  from  the  pulleys  displays  greater  variety  of  shape,  so  the 
power  of  the  mover  varies  to  that  of  its  resistance.        Forster  n  73  v. 

Ascertain  always  the  proportion  of  the  blow  in  company  with  the 
object  which  has  to  receive  it. 

Since  one  hundred  pounds  applied  at  a  single  blow  makes  a  greater 
percussion  than  a  million  applied  one  by  one,  I  wish  that  when  you 
train  the  battering-ram  on  the  castle  you  cause  the  blow  to  be  raised  in 
the  air  by  the  simple  weight  of  the  men,  and  then  you  pull  it  back  after 
the  manner  of  a  catapult  or  cross-bow,  and  you  will  have  a  good  result. 

Forster  11  74  r. 

Prove  what  the  difference  is  in  giving  to  the  arrow  blow  and  move- 
ment, or  merely  blow  alone  or  movement  alone  as  is  the  custom. 

The  blow  and  movement  you  will  give  to  the  middle  of  the  move- 
ment usually  made  by  the  cord  of  the  cross-bow. 

The  blow  alone  you  will  give  to  the  arrow  at  the  end  of  the  move- 
ment of  the  cord.  The  movement  alone  you  will  give  when  in  all  the 
movement  of  the  cord  you  always  find  the  arrow.       Forster  11  75  r. 

Of  the  screws  of  equal  thickness  that  will  be  most  difficult  which  has 
most  grooves  upon  it. 

And  among  those  screws  of  equal  length,  thickness  and  number  of 
ridges,  you  will  find  that  the  easiest  to  move  which  has  the  greatest 
number  of  curves  of  its  ridges. 

That  screw  will  be  strongest  to  sustain  weights  of  which  the  ridges 
have  the  less  number  of  curves,  but  it  will  be  most  difficult  to  move. 

Forster  11  77  v. 

The  screw  will  keep  a  straighter  course  which  is  rather  drawn  than 
driven;  that  is  it  keeps  its  direction  better  if  you  pull  than  if  you  press. 

If  you  drive  or  press  with  the  screw,  which  touches  the  thing  pressed 
with  the  extremity  of  its  curves,  this  screw  being  forced  will  bend  on 
the  side  opposite  to  this  extremity  of  its  curve  which  presses. 

Forster  11  78  r. 


MOVEMENT  AND   WEIGHT  595 

I  have  ten  measures  of  time  and  ten  measures  of  force  and  ten 
incisures  of  movement  and  ten  of  weight,  and  I  wish  to  raise  up  this 
weight. 

If  I  double  the  weight  and  not  the  force  in  the  movement  it  becomes 
necessary  to  double  the  time. 

If  I  double  the  weight  and  not  the  time  or  the  force  it  becomes 
necessary  to  halve  the  movement. 

If  I  double  the  weight  and  not  the  movement  or  the  time  it  becomes 
necessary  to  double  the  force. 

If  I  halve  the  weight  and  not  the  movement  or  the  time,  the  force  is 
halved.  Forster  11  78  v. 

[Drawing] 

If  you  wish  to  know  the  weight  of  the  cord  that  supports  the  last 
pulley,  multiply  always  cubically  the  weight  attached  to  the  foot  by 
the  number  of  the  pulleys,  and  the  result  of  this  multiplication  will  be 
the  number  of  the  pounds  which  this  last  cord  receives  from  the  afore- 
said weight  attached  to  its  foot. 

Let  us  suppose  therefore  that  this  weight  attached  to  the  foot  is 
four,  then  you  will  say :  four  pounds  multiplied  by  four  the  number  of 
the  pulleys  makes  sixteen;  and  then  four  times  sixteen  makes  sixty- 
four;  and  it  is  multiplied  cubically,  and  this  cord  above  supports  sixty- 
four  pounds  by  the  four  attached  to  the  feet;  and  if  there  were  six 
such  pulleys  y^u  would  say:  four  times  six  are  twenty-four,  and  four 
times  twenty-four  are  ninety-eight  (sic!) ;  and  this  great  weight  is  sup- 
ported by  the  last  cord  with  the  four  pounds  attached  to  the  foot. 

Here  it  is  shown  how  the  four  pounds  proceeds  to  double  con- 
tinually; with  the  addition  of  each  wheel  the  previous  weight  is 
doubled.  Forster  11  82  v. 

[Drawing] 

The  cord  doubles  its  natural  strength  as  many  times  as  it  is  suspended 
in  different  parts  of  its  length.  Forster  11  83  r. 

Gravity  with  suspended  cord  at  every  degree  of  movement  makes 
degrees  of  weight. 

The  force  that  moves  gravity  on  suspended  cord  will  be  as  great  as 
that  which  moves  this  gravity  over  rollers  or  balls  which  are  placed 


596  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

upon  a  surface  that  is  quite  smooth — because  each  is  supported  exactly. 

But  at  this  point  a  doubt  seems  to  arise,  that  is  by  the  fifteenth  of  the 
first,  where  it  says  that  the  centre  of  the  gravity  of  a  suspended  cord  is 
beneath  the  centre  of  this  cord,  and  this  centre  of  the  gravity  desires  as 
far  as  possible  to  approach  to  the  centre  of  the  earth;  and  if  you  draw 
this  weight  cross-wise,  fixed  weight  makes  a  revolving  movement  and 
raises  itself  up  and  goes  away  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  and  so  in- 
treases  weight  in  its  mover.  The  weight  which  is  resting  on  balls  on  a 
smooth  surface  always  has  its  centre  at  an  equal  distance  from  the 
centre  of  the  world,  and  consequently  it  does  not  increase  the  resistance 
in  its  mover. 

The  resistance  created  by  friction  for  the  movement  of  weights  is 
separate  and  remote  from  this  weight. 

Reason 

This  is  shown  by  the  things  said  before,  that  is  that  it  is  clearly  seen 
that  the  movement  made  by  the  weights  along  the  horizontal  line  does 
not  of  itself  offer  any  other  resistance  to  its  mover  than  its  natural 
friction  which  it  makes  with  a  smooth  surface  where  it  touches  it; 
which  movement  becomes  more  difficult  in  proportion  as  the  smooth 
surface  becomes  more  scoured  and  rough.  And  in  order  to  see  the 
truth  of  this  move  the  said  weight  upon  balls  on  an  absolutely  smooth 
surface:  you  will  then  see  that  it  will  move  without  effort. 

The  weight  the  movement  of  which  is  rendered  difficult  by  the 
friction  which  it  makes  with  the  smooth  surface  where  it  moves,  will 
increase  in  gravity  as  it  lacks  effort  in  the  friction  which  it  has  with  the 
smooth  surface  where  it  moves. 

This  is  shown  as  it  raises  itself  on  a  line  that  has  a  considerable  slant, 
for  as  it  were  its  simple  weight  is  in  the  force  of  the  mover,  and  the 
friction  is  small.  Forster  n  86  r.  and  85  v. 

[Drawing] 

Whoever  knows  how  great  a  weight  raises  the  hundred  pounds  up- 
wards by  this  slope  knows  the  capacity  of  the  screw. 

If  you  desire  true  knowledge  of  the  quantity  of  the  weight  required 
to  move  the  hundred  pounds  over  the  sloping  road,  it  is  necessary  to 
know  the  nature  of  the  contact  which  this  weight  has  with  the  smooth 


MOVEMENT   AND  WEIGHT  597 

surface  where  it  produces  friction  by  its  movement,  because  different 
bodies  have  different  kinds  of  friction;  because  if  there  shall  be  two 
bodies  with  different  surfaces,  that  is  that  one  is  soft  and  polished  and 
well  greased  or  soaped,  and  it  is  moved  upon  a  smooth  surface  of  a 
similar  kind,  it  will  move  much  more  easily  than  that  which  has  been 
made  rough  by  the  use  of  lime  or  a  rasping-file.  Therefore  always 
when  you  wish  to  know  the  quantity  of  the  force  that  is  required  in 
order  to  drag  the  same  weight  over  beds  of  different  slope,  you  have  to 
make  the  experiment  and  ascertain  what  amount  of  force  is  required  to 
move  the  weight  along  a  level  road,  that  is  to  ascertain  the  nature  of  its 
friction.  And  if  you  neither  know  this  nor  wish  to  make  trial  of  it,  set 
up  an  obstacle  in  your  way,  and  that  goes  changing  according  to  the 
slope  of  the  road  whence  this  weight  ought  to  be  drawn.  Seeing  that 
different  slopes  make  different  degrees  of  resistance  at  their  contact; 
and  the  reason  is  that  if  the  weight  which  ought  to  move  is  placed 
upon  level  ground  and  for  this  reason  has  to  be  dragged,  undoubtedly 
this  weight  will  be  in  the  first  strength  of  resistance,  because  everything 
rests  upon  the  earth  and  nothing  upon  the  cord  which  ought  to  move 
it.  But  if  you  wish  to  draw  it  along  a  very  steep  road  all  the  weight 
which  it  gives  of  itself  to  the  cord  which  sustains  it  is  substracted  from 
the  contact  of  its  friction;  but  as  it  is  necessary  to  show  another  more 
palpable  reason: — you  know  that  if  one  were  to  draw  it  upright  graz- 
ing and  touching  a  wall  somewhat,  that  this  weight  is  almost  all  upon 
the  cord  which  draws  it  and  only  a  minute  part  rests  upon  the  wall 
where  it  rubs.  Forster  11  87  r.  and  86  v. 

If  the  centre  of  the  weight  be  outside  the  perpendicular  of  the  centre 
of  the  screw  which  moves  it: 

This  weight  will  show  itself  heavier  to  its  mover,  and  the  teeth  of  the 
screw  together  with  those  of  the  screw-box  which  encloses  them  will 
be  oppositely  weighed  down  by  two  contrary  forces.     Forster  11  97  r. 

Weights  work  in  balances  along  the  line  of  their  perpendicular. 

You  have  in  the  ninth  of  my  theory  that  when  the  weight  is  attached 
to  the  transverse  cord  within  equal  angles  each  extremity  of  this  cord 
is  equally  burdened  by  this  weight;  moreover  the  fact  of  these  ex- 
tremities being  at  varying  distances  from  this  weight  does  not  make 
any  difference.  Forster  11  99  r.

Why  the  small  gimlet  makes  its  hole  without  anything  to  guide  it

Let  the  weight  be  affixed  with  as  many  cords  as  you  wish  to  the  arms 
of  the  balances,  so  that  you  have  only  to  seek,  if  it  is  not  the  perpen- 
dicular of  the  centre  of  the  weight,  in  what  part  it  intersects  with  the 
arm  of  the  balance  which  is  above  it.  Forster  n  105  r.

I  have  affixed  three  different  weights  somehow  to  one  of  the  arms 
of  the  balance  at  three  different  places  chosen  by  chance,  and  I  would 
wish  on  the  opposite  arm  to  give  a  counterpoise  to  the  said  weights; 
which  counterpoises  are  two,  that  is  the  one  of  four  pounds  and  the 
other  of  two,  and  finally  I  should  wish  to  attach  them  separately  at 
such  a  place  that  they  would  be  equal  in  weight  to  three  other  weights 
opposite.  Forster   11  105  v. 

[Diagrams] 

To  one  of  the  arms  of  the  balance  I  have  attached  three  different 
weights,  that  is  one  of  one  pound,  another  of  two  and  a  third  of  three 
pounds,  and  these  said  weights  are  at  varying  distances  from  each  other 
as  chance  may  have  it;  now  I  have  a  weight  of  eight  pounds  and  I 
would  wish  to  set  it  upon  the  opposite  balance  as  counterpoise  to  these 
three  such  weights;  I  ask  in  what  position  it  is  to  be  placed  to  make 
itself  equal  to  those  opposite  to  it:  you  will  do  as  you  see  here  below. 

Forster  11  106  r. 

The  centre  of  any  heavy  body  whatsoever  will  stand  in  a  perpen- 
dicular line  beneath  the  centre  of  the  cord  on  which  it  is  suspended. 

I  ask  if  you  were  to  suspend  a  pole  outside  the  centre  of  its  length 
what  degree  of  slant  it  will  assume. 

The  pole  which  is  suspended  outside  the  centre  of  its  length  by  a 
single  cord  will  assume  such  a  slant  as  will  make  with  its  opposite 
sides  together  with  the  perpendicular  of  the  centre  of  the  cord  that 
supports  it,  two  equal  acute  angles  or  two  equal  obtuse  angles.

[Sketch] 

If  the  wheels  are  of  equal  height  the  waggon  will  move  with  a  sure 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  599 

degree  of  force.  But  if  you  change  the  two  back  wheels  for  wheels  of 
greater  height  it  will  move  with  greater  ease.  If  however  in  the  case  of 
the  first  wheels  you  were  to  change  the  wheels  in  front  for  some  less 
in  height,  in  such  a  way  that  in  the  same  manner  the  wheels  in  front 
were  low  and  those  behind  high,  the  first  movement  will  have  been 
made  more  difficult  and  harder.  Forster  11  124  r. 

The  balance  with  three  equal  arms  will  remain  stable  of  itself  in 
whatever  position  you  may  turn  it,  and  the  weights  will  always  stand 
in  double  proportion,  except  when  one  of  the  arms  is  in  a  perpen- 
dicular line,  because  then  the  proportion  will  be  that  of  the  equality. 
Take  away  the  perpendicular  of  the  centres  of  the  weights  of  each  arm 
of  this  triangular  balance,  and  observe  how  they  stand  there  with  the 
centre  of  the  balance;  and  if  you  find  two  on  one  side,  take  their  centre 
against  the  centre  of  the  opposite  arm  and  you  will  see  a  double  pro- 
portion of  spaces  and  weights.  Forster  11  126  r. 

If  centres  of  weights  are  equidistant  from  their  common  centre  these 
weights  will  be  equal  in  equilibrium. 

If  perpendiculars  of  centres  of  weights  are  equidistant  from  the  per- 
pendicular of  their  common  centre  these  weights  will  stand  equal  in 
equilibrium  if  they  are  equal. 

For  this  reason  the  centre  of  the  world  is  always  movable  through 
the  change  in  the  overflowing  of  the  ocean.  Forster  11  126  v. 

Gravity  is  all  in  all  the  length  of  its  support  and  all  in  every  part 
of  it. 

Why  has  it  been  found  by  experiment  that  when  the  pole  stands  in  a 
slanting  line  and  remains  with  its  parts  equidistant  to  the  central  line 
it  does  not  remain  slanting  but  rather  becomes  horizontal,  forming 
four  right  angles  with  the  above-mentioned  central  line  ? 

The  answer  is  that  it  proceeds  from  the  imperfection  of  the  pole. 

Forster  11  128  r. 

A  weight  of  one  pound  falls  one  braccio  and  gives  a  blow  of  a  cer- 
tain force;  the  question  is  asked  if  a  weight  of  half  a  pound  were  to  fall 
double  the  height,  or  twice  from  the  first  height,  or  twice  the  weight 
from  half  the  height  or  four  times  from  a  quarter  of  the  height,  if  it 
would  produce  the  same  result.  Forster  11  130  r.

[  Diagram  ] 

Although  the  time  in  which  the  movement  of  heavy  bodies  occurs 
together  with  the  length  of  this  movement  is  divisible,  it  does  not  fol- 
low that  the  act  of  percussion  because  made  on  the  surface  of  these 
bodies  can  itself  be  divided. 

Though  the  figure  s  strikes  on  the  slant  a  n  and  that  it  will  appear 
that  being  fleeting  it  may  not  be  powerful,  it  will  not  fail  to  be  the  case 
that  the  act  of  percussion  will  be  much  more  powerful  than  if  it  was  a 
round  body  and  that  its  rebound  will  be  along  the  line. 

Forster  11  131  r. 

OF  FRICTION 

The  action  of  friction  is  divided  into  parts  of  which  one  is  simple 
and  all  the  others  are  compound.  Simple  is  when  the  object  is  dragged 
along  a  plain  smooth  surface  without  anything  intervening;  this  alone 
is  the  form  that  creates  fire  when  it  is  powerful,  that  is  it  produces 
fire,  as  is  seen  with  water-wheels  when  the  water  between  the  sharp- 
ened iron  and  this  wheel  is  taken  away. 

The  others  are  compound  and  are  divided  into  two  parts;  and  the 
first  is  when  any  greasiness  of  any  thin  substance  is  interposed  be- 
tween the  bodies  which  rub  together;  and  the  second  is  when  other 
friction  is  interposed  between  this  as  would  be  the  friction  of  the  poles 
of  the  wheels.  The  first  of  these  is  also  divided  into  two  parts,  namely 
the  greasiness  which  is  interposed  in  the  aforesaid  second  form  of  fric- 
tion and  the  balls  and  things  like  these.  Forster  11  131  v. 

All  things  and  everything  whatsoever  however  thin  it  be  which  is 
interposed  in  the  middle  between  objects  that  rub  together  lighten  the 
difficulty  of  this  friction. 

Observe  the  friction  of  great  weights,  which  make  rubbing  move- 
ments, how  I  have  shown  in  the  fourth  of  the  seventh  that  the  greater 
the  wheel  that  is  interposed  the  easier  this  movement  becomes;  and  so 
also  conversely  the  less  easy  in  proportion  as  the  intervening  thing  is 
thinner  as  would  be  any  thin  greasy  substance;  and  so  increasing  tiny 
grains  such  as  millet  make  it  better  and  easier,  and  even  more  the  balls 


MOVEMENT   AND  WEIGHT  60 1 

of  wood  or  rollers,  that   is  wheels  shaped  like  cylinders,  and  as  these 
rollers  become  greater  so  the  movements  become  easier. 

Forster  11  132  r. 

That  thing  which  is  entirely  consumed  by  the  long  movement  of  its 
friction  will  have  part  of  it  consumed  at  the  beginning  of  this  move- 
ment. 

This  shows  us  that  it  is  impossible  to  give  or  make  anything  of  any 
absolute  exactness,  for  if  you  desire  to  make  a  perfect  circle  of  the 
movement  of  one  of  the  points  of  the  compasses,  and  you  admit  or  con- 
firm what  is  set  forth  above,  namely  that  in  the  course  of  long  move- 
ment this  point  tends  to  become  worn  away,  it  is  necessary  to  concede 
that  if  the  whole  be  consumed  in  the  whole  of  a  certain  space  of  time, 
the  part  will  be  consumed  in  the  part  of  this  time,  and  that  the  indi- 
visible in  the  indivisible  time  may  give  a  beginning  to  such  con- 
sumption. 

And  thus  the  opposite  point  of  these  compasses  which  turns  in  itself 
over  the  centre  of  this  circle,  at  every  stage  of  movement  is  in  process  of 
being  itself  consumed  and  of  consuming  the  place  on  which  it  rests; 
whence  we  may  say  that  the  end  of  the  circle  is  not  joined  with  its  be- 
ginning, rather  the  end  of  such  line  is  some  imperceptible  part  nearer 
towards  the  centre  of  such  circle. 

The  friction  made  by  the  same  weight  will  be  of  equal  resistance  at 
the  beginning  of  its  movement  although  the  contact  may  be  of  different 
breadths  or  lengths. 

The  greatness  of  the  contact  made  by  compact  bodies  in  their  fric- 
tion will  have  so  much  more  permanence  as  it  is  of  greater  bulk;  and 
so  also  conversely  it  will  be  so  much  less  enduring  as  it  is  of  less  size. 

That  which  is  said  is  shown  in  the  case  of  the  friction  made  by  the 
head  of  the  handle  of  the  knife,  for  in  equal  time  it  is  more  perceptible 
than  that  which  is  made  by  its  point.  Forster  11  133  r.  and  132  v. 

Impetus  transports  the  movable  thing  beyond  its  natural  position. 

Every  movement  has  terminated  length,  according  to  the  power 
which  moves  it,  and  upon  this  one  forms  the  rule. 

Every  movable  thing  which  acquires  velocity  in  the  act  of  move- 
ment is  moved  under  its  natural  movement,  and  so  conversely  when  it 
loses  it  moves  with  accidental  movement.  Forster  11  141  v, 


602  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

[Sketch] 

Proof  how  these  cords  have  equal  weight. 

If  the  center  of  the  weight  is  located  in  the  middle  of  the  equal 
number  of  cords  which  support  it  this  weight  is  equally  distributed 
between  each  cord. 

Here  one  is  supposing  the  pole  to  be  unbendable,  and  not  taking 
count  in  cases  like  these  of  the  weight  of  the  instrument  but  only  of  the 
weight  attached.  Forster  n  142  r. 

The  gravity  which  is  moved  in  conformity  with  its  natural  position 
with  every  degree  of  movement  acquires  a  degree  of  speed. 

And  if  the  gravity  shall  move  in  opposition  to  its  natural  position 
with  every  degree  of  movement  it  loses  a  degree  of  speed. 

In  transverse  movements  the  degrees  of  diminution  are  in  the  case 
of  that  which  goes  upward.  Forster  11  144  r. 

The  pole  which  is  suspended  at  its  extremities  by  two  cords  divides 
its  weight  equally  between  these  cords. 

But  if  one  of  the  cords  remains  fixed  and  the  other  moves  towards  it, 
weight  moves  from  this  fixed  cord  and  joins  itself  to  the  weight  of  the 
movable  one. 

The  more  a  cord  is  moved  towards  the  centre  of  the  pole  the  more 
weight  is  taken  from  the  other  cord. 

The  weight  which  is  moved  within  the  cords  is  in  the  same  propor- 
tion to  the  first  weights  as  is  the  movement  made  by  the  cord  to  the 
remainder  of  the  pole.  Forster  11  150  r. 

But  if  the  one  cord  is  fixed  and  the  other  moves  towards  it,  weight 
moves  from  this  fixed  cord  and  is  united  with  that  of  the  movable  one. 

Forster  n  150  v. 

The  pole  which  at  its  extremities  is  suspended  to  two  cords  divides  its 
weight  equally  between  these  cords. 

But  if  one  of  the  cords  is  moved  towards  the  other  every  degree  of 
movement  corresponds  to  this  change  of  weight. 

The  weight  that  moves  between  the  cords  has  such  proportion  to  the 
first  weights  as  the  movement  made  by  the  cord  has  to  the  remainder 
of  the  pole. 

The  remainders  of  the  weights  which  will  be  left  to  these  cords  will 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  603 

have  together  such  proportion  as  the  opposite  spaces  which  are  enclosed 
between  the  two  cords  and  the  centre  of  the  pole  have  between  them. 

Forster  11  151  r. 

The  variety  of  the  weight  which  this  cord  acquires  by  its  movement 
will  have  such  proportion  with  that  of  the  first  weight  as  its  movement 
has  with  the  remainder  of  the  pole. 

And  the  weights  that  are  changed  on  the  said  cords  will  have  to- 
gether such  proportion  as  the  spaces  which  intervene  between  the  two 
cords  and  the  centre  of  the  pole  have  between  themselves. 

And  weights  which  have  remained  on  the  said  cords  will  have  to- 
gether such  proportion  as  oppositely  have  the  spaces  that  are  enclosed 
between  the  centre  of  the  pole  and  the  two  cords. 

The  weight  which  moves  between  the  cords  has  such  proportion  to 
the  first  weights  as  the  movement  made  by  the  cord  has  to  the  re- 
mainder of  the  pole.  Forster  11  151  v. 

The  pole  which  is  suspended  by  two  cords  at  its  extremities  divides 
its  weight  equally  between  these  cords;  and  although  these  cords  may 
be  moved  equally  towards  the  centre  of  the  pole  they  do  not  vary  their 
first  weight. 

But  should  one  of  the  cords  towards  the  centre  of  the  pole  be  moved 
and  the  other  remain  fixed  at  its  extremity  every  degree  of  movement 
occasions  among  them  variation  of  weight;  and  the  remainder  of  the 
weights  of  the  cords  will  have  such  proportion  one  with  another  as  have 
the  spaces  opposite  to  them  which  are  enclosed  between  the  centre  of 
the  pole  and  the  two  cords.  Forster  11  152  r. 

Such  proportion  as  there  is  between  those  spaces  which  are  enclosed 
between  the  centre  of  the  length  of  the  suspended  pole  and  the  two 
cords  which  sustain  this  pole,  such  will  there  be  one  with  another  the 
opposite  weights  which  this  pole  gives  of  itself  and  the  cords  which 
support  it. 

The  thing  which  moves  by  natural  movement  at  every  degree  of 
movement  acquires  degrees  of  speed,  which  degrees  will  bear  the  same 
proportion,  the  last  to  the  last  but  one,  as  the  second  has  to  the  first. 

Forster  11  152  v. 


6o4  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

The  pole  which  is  suspended  by  the  extremities  of  its  length  to  two 
cords  divides  its  weight  equally  between  these  cords. 

But  if  the  one  of  the  cords  towards  the  middle  of  the  length  of  the 
pole  be  moved  there  will  be  the  same  proportion  between  the  weight 
separated  from  the  stationary  cord  and  joined  to  that  which  moved,  as 
between  the  movement  made  by  the  cord  and  the  remainder  of  the 
pole  which  is  supported  between  the  two  cords. 

But  if  the  one  of  the  cords  is  stationary  and  the  other  is  moved 
towards  it,  weight  departs  from  this  stationary  cord  and  unites  itself 
to  that  which  is  moved,  which  has  the  same  proportion  to  the  remain- 
ing part  of  the  first  weight  as  the  movement  made  by  the  cord  has  to 
the  first  space  of  these  cords.  Forster  n  153  r. 

Whoever  speaks  of  arms  of  a  balance  means  them  to  be  of  equal 
thickness  and  weight  if  they  are  of  equal  length. 

The  spaces  which  are  interposed  between  the  centre  of  the  arms  and 
the  pole  of  the  balance  have  between  them  such  proportion  as  the 
opposite  weights  have  with  them  as  the  one  arm  serves  as  counterpoise 
to  the  other. 

The  spaces  which  are  enclosed  between  the  centre  of  the  two  arms  of 
the  balance  and  the  pole  of  this  balance  have  between  them  such  pro- 
portion as  is  that  which  the  weights  of  these  arms  have  between  them 
together  with  their  length.  Forster  11  154  v. 

The  centre  of  the  length  of  each  arm  of  the  balance  is  the  true 
centre  of  its  gravity. 

The  arms  of  the  balance  make  of  themselves  a  counterpoise  the  one 
to  the  other;  which  counterpoise  will  have  with  these  arms  as  many 
varieties  as  the  proportions  of  these  arms  will  be  varied. 

That  proportion  which  the  one  arm  of  the  balance  has  to  its  opposite 
arm  such  the  weight  will  have  with  it  as  this  lightens  the  opposite  arm. 

Forster  11  155  v. 

The  centre  of  the  length  of  each  arm  of  the  balance  is  the  true  centre 
of  its  gravity. 

Arm  of  balance  is  said  to  be  that  space  which  is  found  between  the 
weight  attached  to  this  balance  and  its  pole. 

That  proportion  which  exists  between  the  spaces  that  come  between 


MOVEMENT   AND   WEIGHT  605 

the  centres  of  the  arms  and  the  pole  of  the  balance,  is  as  that  oi  the 
opposite  weights  which  the  one  arm  gives  of  itself  in  counterpoise  to 
the  other  with  its  own  arm  which  is  the  counterpoise. 

Arms  of  the  balance  are  said  to  be  those  which  are  found  between  the 
centres  of  the  weights  affixed  to  it  and  the  pole  of  the  said  balance. 

Forster  11  157  r. 

Where  the  support  makes  less  resistance  there  the  weight  supported 
by  it  shows  itself  heavier;  and  that  part  of  the  support  makes  less  re- 
sistance which  is  more  remote  from  its  foundation.  Forster  11  157  v. 

Of  the  pyramids  of  equal  height  the  proportion  of  the  weight  will  be 
as  that  of  the  bases. 

Pyramids  of  varying  lengths  upon  equal  bases  will  be  of  as  many 
different  proportionate  weights  as  their  lengths  are  varying;  the 
pyramids  of  equal  bases  with  different  lengths  enclosed  in  a  parallelo- 
gram will  be  of  equal  weight.  Forster  11  158  r.

If  a  chimney-sweeper  weighs  two  hundred  pounds  how  much  force 
does  he  exert  with  his  feet  and  back  in  the  chimney?

[S\etch] 
I  ask  why  the  blow  of  the  hammer  causes  the  nail  to  jump  out. 

Forster  in  20  v. 

The  air  which  closes  itself  up  with  fury  behind  the  bodies  which 
move  through  it  offers  more  resistance  than  that  which  remains  sta- 
tionary, consequently  the  ball  when  struck  covers  a  greater  distance 
than  the  jump  or  the  leap  can  serve  as  the  occasion  of. 

Forster  in  27  r. 

Why  it  is  first  the  blow  rather  than  the  movement  caused  by  it;  the 
blow  has  performed  its  function  before  the  object  has  started  on  its 
course.  Forster  111  28  r. 

[S\etch] 

It  will  be  impossible  to  break  that  support  which  is  the  centre  of  the 
gravity  placed  upon  it;  and  the  centre  of  this  itself  will  be  the  perpen- 
dicular upon  the  centre  of  its  base.  Forster  in  29  r. 


6o6  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

A  blow  is  an  end  of  movement  created  in  an  indivisible  period  of 
time,  because  it  is  caused  at  the  point  which  is  the  end  of  the  line  of 
the  movement  made  by  the  weight  which  is  the  cause  of  the  blow. 

Forster  m  32  r. 

No  animal  can  simply  move  more  weight  than  is  the  load  that  finds 
itself  outside  the  centre  of  its  support.  Forster  in  34  r. 

The  movement  made  by  the  arrow  in  ordinary  simple  flight  will 
increase  as  much  as  the  power  of  the  composite  movement  of  a  second 
tethered  (?)   [apicata]  flight.  Forster  in  38  v. 

There  will  be  such  proportion  between  the  amount  of  movement  of 
a  stone  that  is  moved  and  that  of  the  thing  that  is  moving,  one  time 
more  than  another,  as  the  time  of  the  moving  thing  is  swifter  on  the 
one  occasion  than  on  the  other.  Forster  in  39  r. 

The  infinite  movements  of  the  varieties  of  the  instruments  which 
may  be  constructed  for  drawing  weights  will  be  of  equal  power  in  the 
completed  movement  of  the  thing  moving  and  of  that  moved.

Define  to  me  why  one  who  slides  on  the  ice  does  not  fall.

Prove  which  keeps  its  movement  more,  a  wheel  that  revolves  on  the 
flat  or  on  an  edge. 

Prove  whether  the  impetus  of  the  revolving  of  the  wheels  acquires 
force  from  its  mover.  Forster  in  48  r. 

Every  free  heavy  body  when  falling  directs  its  course  to  the  centre, 
and  that  part  which  weighs  most  will  be  nearest  to  the  centre  of  the 
world.  Forster  in  51  r. 

As  is  the  proportion  one  to  another  of  the  spaces  that  are  enclosed 
between  the  perpendicular  of  the  weight  attached  to  the  slanting  beam 
and  the  perpendiculars  of  the  extremities  of  this  beam,  so  will  be  that  of 
the  weights  of  the  opposite  extremities  of  the  beam.     Forster  in  51  v. 

If  two  opaque  bodies  are  moved  one  against  the  other  with  inter- 
secting movement  the  two  bodies  will  seem  three;  and  in  like  manner 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  607 

one  thing  will  seem  two,  and  the  two  without  intersecting  movement 
will  appear  to  be  four  as  the  wings  of  birds  when  flying.  Intersected 
movement.  Simple  movement.  Forster  in  55  r. 

The  centre  of  gravity  of  any  heavy  suspended  body  will  always  fall 
below  the  centre  of  its  support. 

The  counterpoise  divides  with  its  weight  if  the  beam  divides  it  in

If  the  sea  bears  down  with  its  weight  upon  its  bed,  a  man  who  lay 
on  this  bed  and  had  a  thousand  braccia  of  water  on  his  back  would 
have  enough  to  crush  him.  Forster  m  66  r. 

The  desire  of  every  heavy  body  is  that  its  centre  may  be  the  centre 
of  the  earth.  Forster  in  66  v. 

Friction  produces  double  the  amount  of  effort  if  the  weight  be 
doubled.  Forster  in  72  r. 

[S\etch] 

I  ask  how  great  a  weight  ought  to  be  placed  at  m  in  order  to  draw 
one  hundred  pounds  at  n;  and  by  degrees  to  ascertain  what  weight  it 
will  be  which  will  overcome  the  other,  giving  the  cord  that  goes  from 
the  one  weight  to  the  other  sometimes  one  twist  round  the  beam, 
sometimes  two  or  three  or  four;  and  similarly  if  the  beam  be  triangular 
or  square  or  of  a  greater  number  of  angles.  Forster  in  73  v. 

I  ask  which  is  swifter — a  spark  going  upwards  and  living  or  turning 
downwards  in  death.  Forster  in  75  v. 

Everything  attached  or  united  to  bodies  .that  have  been  struck  will 
move  against  the  place  of  the  blow. 

That  part  of  the  cord  that  is  twisted  over  the  beam  that  lies  equally, 
will  press  the  part  of  the  beam  more  which  is  nearer  to  the  greater  of 
the  two  weights  that  are  fastened  to  the  extremities  of  the  cord.

[Duration  of  movement  of  liquid] 

The  movement  of  the  liquid  made  in  any  direction,  proceeds  as  far 
in  the  revolution  it  has  commenced  as  there  lives  in  it  the  impetus 
given  to  it  by  its  first  mover.  Fogli   b   28   r.

In  the  same  space  the  arrow  carries  farther  straight  upwards  than  it 
does  obliquely,  and  this  arises  from  the  fact  that  when  the  direction  is 
upwards  the  arrow  or  bullet  falls  by  the  line  in  which  it  rose  and 
obliquely  it  forms  an  arch.  Quaderni  n  15  r.

[Of  long  and  short  steps] 

When  one  is  descending  one  takes  short  steps  because  the  weight

That  wheel  will  revolve  more  easily  which  has  its  axis  of  less

It  is  proved  how  the  air  does  not  push  the  movable  thing  since  it  is 
separated  by  the  power  of  its  mover. 

If  to  the  movable  thing  which  separates  itself  from  its  mover  there 
was  given  the  perception  of  the  movement  of  the  air  which  pushed  it 
behind  it  would  happen  that  the  bullet  of  the  carbine  in  penetrating  a 
leathern  bottle  full  of  water  would  immediately  lose  its  movement  at 
the  beginning  of  its  penetration,  because  instantly  the  water  would 
close  the  entrance  and  separate  it  from  the  air  which  drives  it;  as  to 
which  experience  shows  to  the  contrary,  seeing  that  this  ball  after  the 
said  penetration  of  the  water  moves  for  a  long  time.  And  if  you  were  to 
say  that  the  fury  of  the  movement  of  the  air  or  of  the  water,  through 
which  this  bullet  passes,  which  turns  to  fill  up  the  vacuum  from  which 
the  bullet  departs  point  by  point,  is  that  which  forms  a  wedge  between 
the  back  of  the  bullet  and  the  rest  of  the  air  which  stays  behind  it; 
here  the  reply  is  that  the  air  is  more  powerful  and  more  compressed 
in  front  of  the  bullet  than  that  on  the  opposite  side,  because  this  oppo- 
site side  is  the  air  reflected  by  the  percussion  of  the  bullet.  'The  reflec- 
tion of  anything  is  always  of  less  power  than  its  incidence';  and  if  you 
should  gainsay  me  as  to  this  by  urging  that  this  power  cannot  be  in- 


MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT  6og 

fus^d  in  the  body  that  is  moved,  because  'no  movable  thing  moves  <>l 
itself,  unless  its  members  exert  force  in  other  bodies  outside  it',  as  when 
a  man  in  the  centre  of  a  boat  pulls  the  rope  attached  to  the  stern  of  it, 
in  order  to  give  movement  to  the  ship,  which  work  is  useless  unless  this 
rope  is  fastened  to  the  bank  where  he  wishes  to  move,  or  unless  he 
pushes  the  oars  in  the  water  or  the  pole  on  the  bottom;  therefore  the 
power  not  being  in  the  air  which  drives  the  said  bullet  it  is  necessary 
that  it  is  poured  into  the  bullet;  and  if  it  is  thus  poured  what  has  been 
said  above  serves  as  an  example  of  the  result;  and  in  addition  to  this, 
this  power  so  poured  in  would  be  of  equal  force  through  all  its  sides, 
because  it  would  be  spread  equally  in  equal  quantities  through  all  that 
bullet;  this  however  is  not  so,  and  the  other  premise  you  do  not  grant 
me;  let  us  therefore  seek  for  a  third  to  which  no  exception  can  be 
taken.  'The  potency  of  the  mover  is  separated  from  it  entirely  and  ap- 
plied to  the  body  moved  by  it,  and  it  goes  on  to  consume  itself  in  course 
of  time  in  penetrating  the  air  which  is  always  compressed  before  the 
movable  thing'.  And  this  happens  because  'every  impression  is  pre- 
served for  a  long  time  in  the  object  on  which  it  is  impressed',  as  is  seen 
in  the  circles  created  by  its  percussion  within  the  surface  of  the  water, 
which  move  within  the  water  for  a  long  distance,  and  in  the  eddies  and 
waves,  formed  in  one  spot,  and  carried  by  the  impetus  of  the  water  to 
another,  without  their  destruction;  and  radiance  creates  the  same  effect 
in  the  eye,  and  sound  in  the  ear.  But  if  you  would  also  say  that  the 
air  preserves  the  power  of  the  mover  which  accompanies  it  and  pushes 
its  movable  thing,  how  are  we  to  reconcile  to  this  the  case  of  the  wheel 
which  in  a  storm  of  wind  turns  for  a  long  time,  although  its  mover  is 
separated  from  it? 

It  is  not  air  that  moves  it  for  as  it  is  equally  distributed  round  its  axis 
as  regards  its  outline  and  its  weight,  the  wind  which  embraces  it  on  one 
side  only,  if  it  caresses  the  half  of  the  wheel  which  flies  from  it,  op- 
poses and  resists  the  other  half  of  the  wheel  which  moves  against  it, 
and  consequently  the  wind  which  stops  the  movement  as  much  as  it 
aids  it  does  not  render  this  wheel  any  service  or  disservice;  therefore  the 
potency  of  the  mover  was  left  imprinted  on  the  outside  of  the  wheel 
and  was  not  poured  into  it  or  into  the  air  that  lay  about  it.  If  you  wish 
to  see  the  movement  the  air  makes  when  it  is  penetrated  by  a  movable 
thing  take  an  example  in  the  water,  that  is,  underneath  its  surface,  for 


6io  MOVEMENT  AND  WEIGHT 

it  may  have  mingling  with  it  thin  millet  or  other  minute  seed  which 
floats  at  every  stage  of  height  of  the  water;  and  afterwards  place  some 
movable  thing  within  it  which  floats  in  the  water  and  you  will  see 
the  revolution  of  the  water,  which  ought  to  be  in  a  square  glass  vessel 
shaped  like  a  box.  'Every  natural  act  is  communicated  from  the  doer 
to  the  object  in  the  shortest  possible  time';  and  the  air  beaten  and  com- 
pressed by  the  movable  thing  that  moves  within  it  need  not  therefore 
be  that  which  restores  the  vacuum,  for  the  movable  thing  makes  a 
succession  of  vacuums  as  it  flies  from  it;  but  it  is  that  which  is  nearer 
the  opposite  side  of  the  movable  thing,  that  is  that  by  which  it  leaves 
the  path,  that  continually  rarefies  the  condensation  already  made;  and 
by  means  of  this  rarefaction  the  before  mentioned  vacuum  is  restored. 
'Never,  in  the  same  time  will  the  greater  power  be  subdued  by  the 
lesser  power' :  therefore,  the  swift  movement  of  the  rarefied  air  in  order 
to  fill  up  the  place  in  the  vacuum,  caused  by  the  movable  thing  depart- 
ing from  it,  is  much  weaker  than  that  which  is  continually  being 
compressed  before  the  movable  thing;  of  which  compression  the  air 
that  is  thinner  than  it  will  never  be  the  cause.  Therefore  we  have  con- 
cluded that  the  movable  thing  does  not  move  on  account  of  the  wave 
of  the  air  created  by  the  impetus  of  the  mover.  And  if  you  wish  to  say 
that  the  flooding  of  the  air  which  escapes  before  the  movable  thing  is 
that  which  prepares  the  movement  of  the  movable  thing,  together  with 
the  air,  and  runs  after  it  in  order  to  restore  the  rarefaction  of  the  air, 
to  this  one  replies  that  this  air  is  here  flooded  by  the  movable  thing  and 
not  by  itself,  and  'it  is  impossible  that  at  one  and  the  same  time  the

OF  THE  SQUARING  OF  THE  SURFACE  OF  A  SPHERE  WITH 
STRAIGHT  MOVEMENT 

The  knowledge  of  the  aliquot  part  gives  knowledge  of  its  whole; 
whence  it  follows  that  the  squaring  of  the  eighth  part  of  the  surface  of 
a  sphere  gives  knowledge  of  what  is  the  square  of  the  whole  of  this 
sphere;  and  let  this  be  the  knowledge  of  the  eighth  of  the  sphere:  a  b  c. 

Second  figure.  In  the  second  figure  c  d  e  one  divides  the  eighth  part 
of  the  spherical  surface  in  parallels  of  equal  breadth  and  straightens 
the  curve  of  the  two  sides  c  d  and  d  e;  this  is  done  with  movement 
upon  a  level  place. 

Third  figure.  In  this  third  figure  there  is  that  which  was  promised  in 
the  second,  and  the  straightened  sides  /  g  and  g  h  are  all  the  parallels 
of  the  second,  which  are  enlarged  and  elongated  by  means  of  their 
movement,  because  there  are  the  same  number  of  parallels  made  upon 
the  extended  lines  /  g  and  g  h  (which  are  equal  to  each  other) ;  the 
whole  being  increased  the  parts  also  have  increased. 

Fourth  figure.  In  the  fourth  figure  one  makes  equal  pyramidal  di- 
visions as  shown  in  /  g  h. 

Fifth  figure.  In  the  fifth  figure  the  points  of  the  pyramids  are  opened 
and  enlarged,  the  same  number  of  pyramids  are  reproduced,  and  the 
square  n  m  o  p  is  formed;  but  first  by  movement  one  straightens  the 
line  i  /,  and  one  has  the  fourth  part  of  the  spherical  surface.

DEFINITION  OF  HELIX 

A  helix  is  a  single  curved  line  the  curve  of  which  is  uniformly  irre-

irregular. 

DEFINITION  OF  HEMISPHERE 

A  hemisphere  is  a  body  produced  by  a  half  sphere  contained  by  the 
circle  and  the  surface  of  the  half  sphere. 

The  movement  of  the  hemisphere  commenced  by  the  circumference 
of  its  greatest  circle  ends  in  the  middle  of  this  hemisphere,  after  having 
described  a  spiral  curve.

This  is  proved  by  the  second  concerning  compound  impetus  which 
says:  'Of  compound  impetus  one  part  will  be  as  much  slower  than  the 
other  as  it  is  shorter',  and:  'That  will  be  shorter  which  is  farther  distant 
from  the  direct  line  of  the  movement  made  by  its  mover'.  Therefore  the 
movement  of  the  hemisphere  being  made  up  of  the  movement  of  many 
whole  revolutions  is  of  the  same  movement  as  a  half  revolution.

MENSURATION 

When  you  wish  to  measure  the  breadth  of  a  river  withdraw  from  its 
bank  to  a  somewhat  greater  distance  than  the  width  of  the  stream  and 
observe  some  fixed  mark  on  the  opposite  bank  of  the  river.  Let  a  b 
represent  the  width  of  the  river,  and  a  c  the  space  to  which  you  with- 
draw from  the  river,  this  being  somewhat  longer  than  the  width  of  the 
river. 

Next  draw  at  the  end  of  this  distance  a  perpendicular  line  of  what- 
ever length  you  please,  and  let  this  be  the  line  c  d. 

And  from  this  [spot]  d  observe  again  the  mark  b,  which  you  noted 
on  the  opposite  side  of  the  river,  and  make  a  mark  f1  upon  the  [op- 
posite] bank  at  the  point  which  is  in  the  same  line  d  b.  After  having 
done  this  bisect  the  perpendicular  line  c  d  at  the  point  e  and  from  this 
point  e  make  another  perpendicular  line  at  exact  right  angles,  and 
make  a  mark  where  it  intersects  the  line  d  f1,  and  from  this  make  the 
third  perpendicular  line  g  f2.  You  will  thus  have  formed  the  quad- 
rilateral c  f  e  g,  of  which  you  know  that  the  side  c  f  is  equal  to  f  b, 
because  as  the  point  e  is  in  the  centre  of  the  line  c  d  so  the  point  f  is  in 
the  centre  of  the  other  line  c  b\  then  take  a  f  (from  the  bank)  from 
f  c,  that  is  f  h,  and  you  have  remaining  h  c,  a  distance  equal  to  the 
width  of  the  said  river.  e  51  v.

OF  THE  FIVE  REGULAR  BODIES 

Against  some  commentators  who  blame  the  ancient  inventors  from 
whom  proceed  the  grammars  and  the  sciences  and  campaign  against 
the  dead  inventors,  and  why  they  have  not  discovered  through  idleness 
how  to  become  inventors  themselves,  and  how  with  so  many  books  they 
set  themselves  continually  to  confute  their  masters  by  false  arguments : 

They  say  the  earth  is  hexahedral,1  that  is  to  say  cubical,  that  is  to  say 
a  body  with  six  bases,  and  they  prove  this  by  saying  that  there  is  not 
among  regular  bodies  a  body  of  less  movement  or  more  stable  than  the 
cube.  And  they  attribute  to  fire  the  tetrahedron,  that  is  the  pyramidal 
body,  this  being  more  mobile  according  to  these  philosophers  than  the 
earth;  for  this  reason  they  attribute  the  pyramid  to  fire  and  the  cube  to 
the  earth. 

Now  if  one  had  to  consider  the  stability  of  the  pyramidal  body  and 
to  compare  it  with  that  of  the  cube,  this  cube  is  without  any  compari- 
son more  capable  of  movement  than  the  pyramid,  and  this  is  proved 
as  follows: 

The  cube  has  six  sides,  the  regular  pyramid  four,  and  these  are 
placed  here  in  the  margin  at  a  b\  a  is  the  cube,  b  the  pyramid.  In  order 
to  define  this  proof  I  will  take  a  side  of  the  cube  and  a  side  of  the 
pyramid  which  will  be  c  d;  I  maintain  that  the  cube  c  will  be  more 
adapted  to  a  movement  of  circumvolution  than  the  pyramid  d.  And 
let  e  f,  below,  represent  the  commencement  of  these  movements.  I  say 
that  as  a  matter  of  fact  if  the  base  of  the  cube  and  the  base  of  the  pyra- 
mid rest  upon  the  same  plane  the  pyramid  will  turn  the  third  of  its 
bulk  to  fall  upon  its  other  side,  and  the  cube  will  turn  the  fourth  part 
of  its  circuit  to  change  the  other  side  in  order  to  make  a  base.  From 
these  two  demonstrations  the  conclusion  follows  that  the  cube  will  turn 
completely  with  the  change  of  its  four  sides  upon  the  same  plane,  while 
the  triangle  of  pyramid  will  turn  completely  with  three  of  its  sides 
upon  the  same  plane.  The  pentagon  turns  all  its  five  sides  and  so  the 
more  sides  there  are  the  easier  is  the  movement  because  the  figure  ap- 

1  MS.  has  tetracedronica  coe  cubica — presumably  a  slip  of  the  pen. 


MATHEMATICS  617 

proaches  more  nearly  to  a  sphere.  I  wish  it  to  be  inferred  therefore  that 
the  triangle  is  of  slower  movement  than  the  cube  and  that  therefore 
one  should  take  the  pyramid  and  not  the  cube  for  the  earth.

OF  PROPORTION 

If  from  two  like  wholes  there  be  taken  away  like  parts  there  is  the 
same  proportion  between  part  and  part  as  there  is  between  whole  and 
whole. 

It  follows  that  if  of  these  two  circles  the  one  is  double  the  other,  the 
quarter  portion  of  the  larger  is  double  the  quarter  portion  of  the 
smaller. 

And  there  is  the  same  proportion  between  one  remainder  and  the 
other  as  between  one  whole  and  the  other. 

And  the  same  proportion  between  part  and  part  as  there  is  between 
remainder  and  remainder. 

When  two  circles  touch  the  same  square  at  four  points  one  is  double 
the  other. 

And  also  when  two  squares  touch  the  same  circle  at  four  points  one 
is  double  the  other.  g  17  r. 

GEOMETRY 

The  circle  that  touches  the  three  angles  of  an  equilateral  triangle  is 
triple  the  triangle  that  touches  the  three  sides  of  the  same  triangle. 

The  diameter  of  the  largest  circle  made  in  the  triangle  is  equal  to 
two  thirds  the  axis  of  the  same  triangle.  g  17  v. 

The  proportion  of  circle  to  circle  is  as  that  of  square  to  square  made 
by  the  multiplication  of  their  diameter  by  itself.  Now  make  two  squares 
in  such  proportion  as  pleases  you,  and  then  make  two  circles,  of  which 
one  has  for  its  diameter  the  side  of  the  greater  square,  and  the  other  has 
for  its  diameter  the  side  of  the  lesser  square. 

Thus  by  the  converse  of  the  first  proposition  you  will  have  two  circles 
which  will  bear  the  same  proportion  one  to  another  as  that  of  the  two 
squares.  g  37  r.

TO  OBTAIN  THE  CUBE  OF  THE  SPHERE 

When  you  have  squared  the  surface  of  the  circle  divide  the  square 
into  as  many  small  squares  as  you  please,  provided  that  they  are  equal 
one  to  another,  and  make  each  square  the  base  of  a  pyramid,  of  which 
the  axis  is  the  half  diameter  of  the  sphere  of  which  you  wish  to  obtain 
the  cube;  and  let  them  all  be  equal.  g  39  v. 

[Circles  and  squares] 

Circles  made  upon  the  same  centre  will  be  double  the  one  of  the 
other,  if  the  square  that  is  interposed  between  them  is  in  contact  with 
each  of  them.  And  double  the  one  of  the  other  will  be  the  squares 
formed  upon  the  same  centre,  when  the  circle  that  is  set  in  between 
them  touches  both  the  squares. 

This  is  proved  because  of  the  eight  triangles  of  which  the  larger 
square  is  composed  the  lesser  square  contains  four. 

There  is  the  same  proportion  between  circle  and  circle  that  there  is 
between  square  and  square,  formed  by  the  multiplication  of  their 
diameters. 

Of  all  the  parts  of  circles  which  may  be  in  contact  inside  a  right 
angle  the  greater  is  always  the  equal  of  all  the  less;  and  of  all  the  par- 
allels which  receive  these  parts  in  themselves  the  greater  always  con- 
tains and  is  the  equivalent  of  all  the  small  parallels  formed  in  this  right 
angle  a  b  c.  g  40  r. 

DEFINITION  OF  FOUR  GROUPS  OF  PARALLELS 

Parallel  figures  are  of  four  kinds.  The  first  is  enclosed  between  two 
straight  and  equidistant  lines;  the  second  is  between  two  equidistant 
lines  of  uniform  curve;  the  third  is  between  two  equidistant  lines  of 
varying  curve,  such  as  the  parallel  lines  made  around  the  centre  of  the 
circle;  the  fourth  is  formed  of  a  single  line  curved  round  a  point  at  an 
equal  distance,  that  is  the  line  of  the  circumference  round  the  centre 
of  its  circle. 

And  all  these  lines  are  of  uniform  nature  since  with  movement  the 
straight  line  becomes  curved  and  the  curved  line  becomes  straight,  by

[Of  squaring  the  circle] 

Animals  that  draw  chariots  afford  us  a  very  simple  demonstration

OF  SQUARING  THE  CIRCLE  AND  WHO  IT  WAS  WHO  FIRST 
HAPPENED  TO  DISCOVER  IT 

Vitruvius  while  measuring  the  mile  by  means  of  many  complete 
revolutions  of  the  wheels  that  move  chariots,  extended  in  his  stadia 
many  of  the  lines  of  the  circumference  of  these  wheels.  He  learnt  these 
from  the  animals  that  are  movers  of  these  chariots,  but  he  did  not 
recognise  that  that  was  the  means  of  finding  the  square  equal  to  a 
circle.  This  was  first  discovered  by  Archimedes  the  Syracusan  who 
found  that  the  multiplication  of  half  the  diameter  of  a  circle  by  half 
of  its  circumference  made  a  rectilinear  quadrilateral  equal  to  the  circle.

The  fact  that  a  thing  may  be  either  raised  or  pulled  causes  great

one  moves  it  by  simply  lifting  it  it  shows  itself  as  a  thousand  pounds, 
whereas  if  it  is  pulled  it  becomes  less  by  a  third;  and  if  it  is  pulled  with 
wheels  it  is  diminished  by  as  many  degrees  in  proportion  to  the  size  of 
the  wheel,  and  also  according  to  the  number  of  the  various  wheels. 
And  with  the  same  time  and  power  it  can  make  the  same  journey, 
with  different  degrees  of  time  and  power  also  in  the  same  time  and 
movement;  and  it  does  this  merely  by  increasing  the  number  of  the 
wheels,  on  which  rest  the  axles  which  would  also  be  increased.

By  the  ninth  of  the  second  of  the  Elements,  which  says  that  the

therefore : — 

The  central  line  is  the  name  given  to  what  one  imagines  to  be  the 
straight  line  from  the  thing  to  the  centre  of  the  world. 

The  centre  of  all  suspended  gravity  desires  to  unite  with  the  central 
line  of  its  support.

And  thai  suspended  gravity  which  happens  to  be  farther  removed 
from  the  central  line  of  its  support  will  acquire  more  force  in  excess  of 
that  of  its  natural  weight. 

Now  in  conclusion  I  affirm  that  the  water  of  the  spiral  eddy1  gives 
the  centre  of  its  gravity  to  the  central  line  of  its  pole,  and  every  small 
weight  that  is  added  on  one  of  its  sides  is  the  cause  of  its  movement.

return  such  as  those  of  bells,  saws  and  things  of  the  same  nature. 

A  pound  of  force  at  b  has  for  result  at  m  ten  thousand  thousands  of 
millions  of  pounds,  and  the  figure  opposite  does  the  same,  being  of  the 
same  nature  and  only  differing  in  that  the  wheels  are  whole  as  they 
have  to  turn  always  in  a  single  direction.  And  know  that  when  the 
first  above  gives  a  hundred  thousand  thousands  of  millions  of  turns, 
that  below  only  gives  one  complete  turn. 

These  are  the  wonders  of  the  science  of  mechanics. 

In  this  manner  one  may  make  a  bell  to  swing  on  a  pivot  so  that  it 
will  be  sounded  by  a  slight  wind,  the  bell  having  its  opposite  weights 
equal  and  equidistant  from  its  centre.  1  57  [9]  v.

This  arrangement  will  produce  a  revolving  movement  of  such  dura- 
tion that  it  will  appear  incredible  and  contrary  to  nature,  because  it 
will  make  much  movement  after  that  of  its  mover.  And  it  causes  the 
weight  m  to  fall  from  such  a  height  that  the  wheel  gives  thirty  revo- 
lutions and  more,  and  then  remains  free  after  the  manner  of  a  spinning 
top;  and  in  order  to  avoid  noise  this  stone  ought  to  fall  upon  straw. 

And  to  make  one  wheel  greater  than  another  down  in  succession 
the  one  below  the  other,  is  only  necessary  in  order  that  the  rim  of  the 
wheel  below  may  not  stop  and  impede  the  pivot  of  the  other.

PROPORTION  IN  ALL  THINGS 

Proportion  is  not  only  found  in  numbers  and  measurements  but  also 
in  sounds,  weights,  times,  positions,  and  in  whatsoever  power  there 
may  be.  k  49  [48  and  15]  r. 

How  one  of  Xenophon's  propositions  is  incorrect: 

If  unequal  things  are  taken  away  from  unequal  things  and  these  are 
in  the  same  proportion  as  the  first  inequality,  the  remainders  will  have 
the  same  proportion  in  their  inequality.  But  if  from  unequal  things 
equal  things  are  taken  away  the  remainders  will  still  be  unequal,  but 
not  in  the  same  proportion  as  before. 

Consider  these  examples:  in  the  first  place  let  the  parts  taken  away 
be  in  the  same  proportion  as  the  wholes,  that  is  let  2  and  4  stand  for 
the  two  wholes  so  that  the  one  is  double  the  other.  Then  take  1  away 
from  2,  there  remains  1;  take  2  away  from  4,  there  remains  2;  and 
these  remainders  have  the  same  proportion  as  the  wholes  and  as  the 
parts  taken  away.  Therefore  if  1  be  taken  from  2  and  2  from  4  there 
remains  the  same  proportion  as  at  first,  that  is  1  and  2  which  is  double 
as  I  said  before :  it  would  follow  that  whoever  should  take  away  equal 
things  would  change  the  former  proportion;  that  is  to  say  that  if  from 
two  numbers  one  of  which  is  double  the  other  such  as  2  and  4  you 
were  to  take  away  an  equal  thing,  that  is  you  took  1  from  2  and  1 
from  4,  there  would  be  left  1  and  3,  that  is  numbers  of  which  one 
would  be  three  times  the  other  and  therefore  more  than  double  in 
difference. 

You  therefore,  Xenophon,  who  wished  to  take  away  equal  parts 
from  unequal  wholes,  believing  that  although  the  remainders  were 
unequal  they  were  still  in  the  same  proportion  as  at  first,  you  were 
deceiving  yourself!  k  61  [12]  r.  and  v. 

DEFINITIONS  OF  A  STRAIGHT  LINE 

First.  A  straight  line  is  that  of  which  each  part  finds  itself  of  equal 
height. 

Second.  A  curved  line  is  that  which  has  a  uniformly  varying  height 
towards  its  extremities  which  are  of  equal  height. 


MATHEMATICS  623 

The  first  definition  and  the  second  are  incorrect  because  a  thing  of 
equal  height  must  have  every  part  of  its  bulk  equally  distant  from  the 
centre  of  the  world.  So  the  curve  /  b  o  would  be  straight  because  it  is 
at  a  uniform  distance  from  this  centre,  and  the  straight  line  a  b  c  would 
be  curved,  because  every  part  of  its  length  varies  uniformly  according 
to  the  distance  of  the  parts  enclosed  within  extremities  that  are  at  equal 
distance  from  the  centre  of  the  world. 

And  if  you  say  that  the  straight  line  is  that  which  receives  three 
points  of  equal  height  in  its  extent  you  still  say  wrong. 

But  if  you  say  that  a  straight  line  is  the  shortest  between  two  given 
points  you  will  give  its  true  definition.        k  78  [30]  v.  and  79  [31]  r.

The  circle  is  the  equal  of  a  rectangular  parallelogram  made  of  the 
fourth  part  of  its  diameter  and  the  whole  of  its  circumference,  or  you 
may  say  of  the  half  of  its  diameter  and  of  its  periphery  (circumfer- 
ence). 

As  though  one  were  to  suppose  the  circle  e  f  to  be  resolved  into  an 
almost  infinite  number  of  pyramids,  and  these  being  then  extended 
upon  the  straight  line  which  touches  their  bases  at  b  d  and  the  half  of 
the  height  being  thus  taken  away,  so  making  the  parallel  abed,  this 
being  precisely  equal  to  the  given  circle  e  f. 

With  regard  to  the  circumference  of  the  circle  it  is  desirable  to 
measure  the  quarter  with  a  piece  of  bark  of  cane,  in  its  spiral  curve 
and  stretching  it  out,  and  to  make  a  rule  as  to  where  is  the  centre  of 
the  circle  from  which  the  movement  of  the  extremity  of  the  measure- 
ment is  directed,  and  similarly  the  centre  of  the  movement  of  many  of 
its  parts,  and  to  make  the  general  rule. 

The  circle  is  a  parallel  figure,  because  all  the  straight  lines  produced 
from  the  centre  to  the  circumference  are  equal  and  fall  upon  the  line 
of  the  circumference  between  equal  angles  and  spherical  lines.  And  the 
same  thing  happens  with  the  transversal  lines  of  the  parallelogram, 
namely  that  they  fall  upon  their  sides  between  right  angles. 

All  rectilinear  pyramids,  and  those  of  curved  lines  formed  upon  the 
same  bases  and  varying  uniformly  as  to  the  breadth  of  their  length 
between  parallel  lines  of  circumference,  are  equal.

Vitruvius  says  that  small  models  are  not  confirmed  in  any  operation 
by  the  effect  of  large  ones.  As  to  this,  I  propose  to  show  here  below  that 
his  conclusion  is  false,  and  especially  by  deducing  the  self-same  argu- 
ments from  which  he  formed  his  opinion,  that  is  by  the  example  of 
the  auger,  as  to  which  he  shows  that  when  the  power  of  a  man  has 
made  a  hole  of  a  certain  diameter  a  hole  of  double  the  diameter 
cannot  then  be  made  by  double  the  power  of  the  said  man  but  by 
much  greater  power.  As  to  this  one  may  very  well  reply  by  pointing  out 
that  the  auger  of  double  the  size  cannot  be  moved  by  double  the 
power,  inasmuch  as  the  surface  of  every  body  similar  in  shape  and  of 
double  the  bulk  is  quadruple  in  quantity  the  one  of  the  other,  as  is 
shown  by  the  two  figures  a  and  n.

Here  one  removes  by  each  of  these  two  augers  a  similar  thickness  of 
wood  from  each  of  the  holes  that  they  make;  but  in  order  that  the  holes 
or  augers  may  be  of  double  quantity  the  one  of  the  other  they  must  be 
fourfold  in  extent  of  surface  and  in  power.  l  53  r.  and  53  v. 

The  right  angle  is  said  to  be  the  first  perfect  among  the  other  angles, 
because  it  finds  itself  at  the  middle  of  the  extremities  of  an  infinite 
number  of  other  kinds  of  angles  which  differ  from  it,  that  is  of  an 
infinite  number  of  obtuse  angles  and  an  infinite  number  of  acute  angles, 
and  all  these  infinite  angles  being  equal  between  themselves  it  finds 
itself  equidistant  to  each  of  them,  being  in  the  middle.       m  cover  v. 

THE  THIRD  LESSON  OF  THE  FIRST 

Triangles  are  of  three  kinds,  of  which  the  first  has  three  acute 
angles,  the  second  a  right  angle  and  two  acute  angles,  and  the  third 
an  obtuse  angle  and  two  acute  angles. 

The  triangle  with  three  acute  angles  may  be  of  three  different  shapes 
of  which  the  first  has  three  equal  sides,  the  second  two  equal  sides  and 
the  third  three  unequal  sides. 

And  the  right-angled  triangle  may  be  of  two  kinds,  i.e.  with  two 
equal  sides  and  with  three  unequal  sides.  m  i  r. 


MATHEMATICS  625 

The  right-angled  triangle  with  two  equal  sides  is  derived  from  the 
half  of  the  square.  And  the  right-angled  triangle  with  three  unequal 
sides  is  formed  by  the  half  of  the  long  tetragon  [rectangle |,  and  the 
obtuse-angled  triangle  with  two  equal  sides  is  formed  by  the  half  of 
the  rhombus  cut  in  its  greatest  length. 

The  square  is  the  name  applied  to  a  figure  of  four  equal  sides  which 
form  within  them  four  right  angles,  that  is  to  say  that  the  lines  that 
compose  the  angles  are  equal  to  each  other.  m  1  v. 


LONG  TETRAGON 

The  long  tetragon  [rectangle]  is  a  surface  figure  contained  by  four 
sides  and  four  right  angles;  and  although  its  opposite  sides  are  equal 
it  does  not  follow  from  this  that  the  sides  which  contain  the  right 
angle  may  not  be  unequal  between  themselves. 

The  rhombus  is  of  two  kinds:  the  first  is  formed  by  the  square  and 
the  second  by  the  parallelogram;  the  first  has  its  opposite  angles  equal 
and  likewise  all  its  sides  equal;  its  only  variation  consists  in  that  no 
side  ends  in  equal  angles  but  with  an  acute  angle  and  an  obtuse  angle.

RHOMBOID 

The  rhomboid  is  the  figure  that  is  formed  from  the  rhombus,  but 
whereas  the  rhombus  is  formed  from  the  square  the  rhomboid  is 
formed  from  the  rectangle.  It  has  the  opposite  sides  and  angles  equal 
to  each  other  but  none  of  its  angles  is  contained  by  equal  sides. 

Parallel  or  equidistant  lines  are  those  which  when  extended  con-

If  two  squared  surfaces  have  the  same  proportion  to  each  other  as

mensurable in  length  it  will  follow  that  the  proportion  between  them

And  if  the  squared  surfaces  are  not  in  the  same  proportion  one  to

A  straight  line  is  that  in  which  if  one  takes  a  point  in  any  position

The  things  which  are  equal  to  the  same  thing  are  also  equal  to  each 
other.  And  if  to  equal  things  one  adds  equal  things  the  wholes  will

And  if  from  equal  things  one  takes  away  equal  things  the  remainders 
will  still  be  equal.  And  if  from  unequal  things  one  takes  away  equal 
things  the  remainders  will  be  unequal.  And  if  two  things  are  equal  to 
another  thing  they  will  be  equal  to  each  other.  And  if  there  are  two 
things  which  are  each  the  half  of  the  same  thing  each  will  be  equal  to

that  neither  is  exceeded  by  the  other  these  things  will  be  equal  to  each

which  corresponds  to  the  fourth  part  of  the  length  of  the  pyramid  I

be  one  sixteenth  of  the  whole  pyramid.  And  if  you  take  away  a  part 
such  as  the  half  of  the  base  which  corresponds  to  the  half  of  the  length

If  the  angle  is  the  contact  of  two  lines,  as  the  lines  are  terminated  in 
a  point  an  infinite  number  of  lines  may  commence  at  this  point,  and 
conversely  an  infinite  number  of  lines  may  end  together  at  this  point: 
consequently  the  point  may  be  common  to  the  beginning  and  the  end 
of  innumerable  lines. 

And  here  it  seems  a  strange  matter  that  the  triangle  is  terminated  in 
a  point  with  the  angle  opposite  to  the  base,  and  from  the  extremities  of 
the  base  one  may  divide  the  triangle  into  an  infinite  number  of  parts;

The  lines  which  form  the  circular  parallels  cannot  be  of  the  same

As  regards  the  curve  lines  which  have  to  make  up  the  curved

Pelacani x  says  that  the  longer  arm  of  this  balance  will  fall  more 
rapidly  than  the  shorter  arm  because  in  its  descent  it  describes  its  quar- 
ter circle  more  directly  than  the  shorter  arm  does;  and  that  since  the 
natural  tendency  of  weights  is  to  fall  by  a  perpendicular  line  the  more 
the  circle  bends  the  slower  will  the  movement  become. 

The  diagram  m  n  controverts  this  argument  in  that  the  descent  of 
the  weights  does  not  proceed  by  circles,  and  yet  the  weight  of  m  the 
longer  arm  falls. 

When  anything  is  farther  away  from  its  base  it  is  less  supported  by 
it;  being  less  supported  it  keeps  more  of  its  liberty,  and  since  a  free 
weight  always  descends,  the  extremity  of  the  rod  of  the  balance  which 
is  most  distant  from  the  point  of  support,  since  it  is  heavy,  will  descend 
of  itself  more  rapidly  than  any  other  part.     ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  2  v.

In  proportion  as  the  extremity  of  the  upper  part  of  the  balance  ap- 
proaches more  nearly  to  the  perpendicular  line  than  the  extremity  of 
the  lower  part,  so  much  longer  and  heavier  will  the  lower  arm  be  than 
the  upper  arm  if  the  beam  be  of  uniform  thickness.

The  suspended  body  which  is  of  smooth  roundness  will  fall  in  the 
line  of  its  centre  and  will  stop  under  the  centre  of  the  cord  by  which  it 
is  suspended. 

The  centre  of  the  weight  of  any  suspended  body  will  stop  in  a  per- 
pendicular line  beneath  the  centre  of  its  support.

Gravity,  force  and  material  movement  together  with  percussion  are 
four  accidental  powers  in  which  all  the  visible  works  of  mortals  have 
their  being  and  their  death. 

Gravity  is  a  certain  accidental  power  which  is  created  by  movement 
and  infused  into  one  element  which  is  either  drawn  or  pushed  by  an- 
other, and  this  gravity  possesses  life  in  proportion  as  this  element 
strives  to  return  to  its  former  state.  b.m.  37  v.

The  redness  or  yolk  of  the  egg  remains  in  the  centre  of  the  albumen 
without  sinking  on  either  side,  and  it  is  either  lighter  or  heavier  or  the 
sanu  weight  as  this  albumen.  If  it  is  lighter  it  ought  to  rise  above  all 
the  albumen  and  remain  in  contact  with  the  shell  of  the  egg;  and  if  it 
is  heavier  it  ought  to  sink  down;  and  if  it  is  of  the  same  weight  it

The  boundary  of  one  thing  is  the  beginning  of  another. 
The  boundaries  of  two  bodies  joined  together  are  interchangeably

OF  THE  ELEMENTS 

The  bodies  of  the  elements  are  united  and  in  them  there  is  neither 
gravity  nor  lightness.  Gravity  and  lightness  are  produced  in  the  mix- 
ture of  the  elements. 

A  point  is  that  which  has  no  centre. 

A  line  is  a  length  (extension)  produced  by  the  movement  of  a  point, 
and  its  extremities  are  points. 

A  surface  is  an  extension  made  by  the  transversal  movement  of  a 
line,  and  its  extremities  are  lines. 

A  body  is  a  quantity  formed  by  the  lateral  movement  of  a  surface, 
and  its  boundaries  are  surfaces. 

A  point  is  that  which  has  no  centre,  and  from  this  it  follows  that  it 
has  neither  breadth,  length  nor  depth. 

A  point  is  that  which  has  no  centre,  and  therefore  it  is  indivisible 
from  any  angle  and  nothing  is  less  than  it  is. 

A  line  is  a  length  made  by  the  movement  of  a  point,  wherefore  it 
has  neither  breadth  nor  depth. 

A  body  is  a  length  and  it  has  breadth  with  depth  formed  by  the 
lateral  movement  of  its  surface.  b.m.  160  r. 

[Definitions] 

A  point  has  no  part;  a  line  is  the  transit  of  a  point;  points  are  the 
boundaries  of  a  line. 


632  MATHEMATICS 

An  instant  has  no  time.  Time  is  made  by  the  movement  of  the 
instant,  and  instants  are  the  boundaries  of  time. 

An  angle  is  the  contact  of  two  lines  which  do  not  proceed  in  the 
same  direction. 

A  surface  is  the  movement  of  a  line,  and  lines  are  the  boundaries  of 
a  surface. 

A  surface  has  no  body;  the  boundaries  of  bodies  are  surfaces. 

b.m.  176  r. 

A  pyramidal  body  is  that  of  which  all  the  lines  that  proceed  from 
the  angles  of  its  base  meet  in  a  point. 

And  a  body  such  as  this  may  be  clothed  with  an  infinite  number  of 
angles  and  sides. 

A  wedge-shaped  body  is  one  in  which  the  lines  that  issue  forth  from 
the  angles  of  the  base  do  not  meet  in  one  single  point  but  in  the  two 
points  which  end  the  line;  and  this  ought  not  to  exceed  or  fall  short. 

b.m.  176  v. 

An  instant  has  no  time,  for  time  is  formed  by  the  movement  of  the 
instant  and  instants  are  the  boundaries  of  time. 

A  point  has  no  part. 

A  line  is  the  transit  of  a  point. 

A  line  is  made  by  the  movement  of  a  point. 

Points  are  the  boundaries  of  a  line. 

An  angle  is  the  contact  of  the  extremities  of  two  lines. 

A  surface  is  formed  by  the  movement  of  a  line  moved  sideways  to 
the  line  of  its  direction.  b.m.  190  v. 

[Propositions] 

Every  body  is  surrounded  by  an  extreme  surface. 

Every  surface  is  full  of  infinite  points. 

Every  point  makes  a  ray. 

The  ray  is  made  up  of  infinite  separating  lines. 

In  each  point  of  the  length  of  any  line  whatever,  there  intersect  lines 
proceeding  from  the  points  of  the  surfaces  of  the  bodies  and  [these] 
form  pyramids. 

Each  line  occupies  the  whole  of  the  point  from  which  it  starts. 

At  the  extremity  of  each  pyramid  there  intersect  lines  proceeding 


MATHEMATICS  633 

from  the  whole  and  from  the  parts  of  the  bodies,  so  that  from  this 
extremity  one  may  see  the  whole  and  the  parts. 

The  air  that  is  between  bodies  is  full  of  the  intersections  formed  by 
the  radiating  images  of  these  bodies. 

The  images  of  the  figures  and  colours  of  each  body  are  transferred 
from  the  one  to  the  other  by  a  pyramid. 

Each  body  fills  the  surrounding  air  by  means  of  these  rays  of  its 
infinite  images. 

The  image  of  each  point  is  in  the  whole  and  in  the  part  of  the  line 
caused  by  this  point. 

Each  point  of  the  one  object  is  by  analogy  capable  of  being  the 
whole  base  of  the  other. 

Each  body  becomes  the  base  of  innumerable  and  infinite  pyramids. 

That  pyramid  which  is  produced  within  more  equal  angles,  will  give 
a  truer  image  of  the  body  from  whence  it  is  produced. 

One  and  the  same  base  serves  as  the  cause  of  innumerable  and 
infinite  pyramids  turned  in  various  directions  and  of  various  degrees 
of  length. 

The  point  of  each  pyramid  has  in  itself  the  whole  image  of  its  base. 

The  centre  line  of  the  pyramid  is  full  of  the  infinite  points  of  other 
pyramids. 

One  pyramid  passes  through  the  other  without  confusion. 

The  quality  of  the  base  is  in  every  part  of  the  length  of  the  pyramid. 

That  point  of  the  pyramid  which  includes  within  itself  all  those  that 
start  upon  the  same  angles,  will  be  less  indicative  of  the  body  from 
whence  it  proceeds  than  any  other  that  is  shut  up  within  it. 

The  pyramid  with  the  most  slender  point  will  reveal  less  the  true 
form  and  quality  of  the  body  from  whence  it  starts. 

That  pyramid  will  be  most  slender  which  has  the  angles  of  its  base 
most  unlike  the  one  to  the  other. 

That  pyramid  which  is  shortest  will  transform  in  greatest  variety 
the  similar  and  equal  parts  of  its  base. 

Upon  the  same  quality  of  angles  will  start  pyramids  of  infinite 
varieties  of  length. 

The  pyramid  of  thickest  point,  more  than  any  other  will  dye  the 
spot  on  which  it  strikes  with  the  colour  of  the  body  from  which  it  is 
derived.  b.m.  232  r.

OF  THE  NATURE  OF  GRAVITY 

Gravity  is  a  fortuitous  quality  which  accrues  to  bodies  when  they 
are  removed  from  their  natural  place. 


OF  THE  NATURE  OF  LEVITY 

Levity  is  allied  with  gravity  as  unequal  weights  are  joined  in  the 
scales,  or  light  liquids  are  placed  beneath  liquids  or  solids  which  are 
heavier  than  they  .  .  .  b.m.  264  r. 

Take  from  one  of  five  regular  bodies  a  like  body  and  so  that  what 
is  left  may  be  of  the  same  shape. 

I  wish  to  take  a  given  pentagon  from  another  pentagon  and  so  that 
the  remainder  may  stay  in  the  form  of  a  pentagon,  and  they  may  be 
bodies  and  not  surfaces. 

Reduce  the  given  pentagon  into  its  cube,  and  proceed  thus  with 
the  greater  pentagon  from  which  you  have  to  extract  the  lesser;  then 
by  the  past  rules  take  the  lesser  cube  from  the  greater  cube,  and  then 
remake  the  pentagon  from  the  remainder  of  this  greater  cube,  which 
by  the  aforesaid  rules  has  remained  cubed. 

That  which  is  here  said  of  the  cube  is  understood  of  all  bodies  which 
touch  the  sphere  with  their  angles,  for  what  is  made  in  the  sphere  may 
be  made  in  the  cube.  Forster  1  5  r. 

All  bodies  have  three  dimensions,  that  is  breadth,  thickness  and 
length. 

The  changes  and  manipulations  of  bodies  are  six,  namely  shortening 
and  lengthening,  becoming  thicker  and  thinner,  being  enlarged  and 
compressed. 

The  surface  has  breadth  and  length  and  is  uniformly  devoid  of 
thickness. 

The  board  is  a  flat  body  and  has  breadth,  length  and  uniform 
thickness. 

Therefore  when  the  board  is  of  uniform  thickness  and  its  surface  of 
uniform  quality  we  may  use  the  table  in  all  its  manipulations  and 
divisions  in  the  same  manner  and  with  the  same  rules  as  we  use  the 
above  mentioned  surfaces.  Forster  1  12  v. 


MATHEMATICS  635 

[Diagram  \ 

The  regular  bodies  are  five  and  the  number  of  those  participating 
between  regular  and  irregular  is  infinite:  seeing  that  each  angle  when 
cut  uncovers  the  base  of  a  pyramid  with  as  many  sides  as  were  the 
sides  of  this  pyramid,  and  there  remain  as  many  bodily  angles  as  there 
are  sides. 

These  angles  may  be  bisected  anew  and  so  you  may  proceed  an 
infinite  number  of  times  because  a  continuing  quantity  may  be  in- 
finitely divided. 

And  the  irregular  bodies  are  also  infinite  through  the  same  rule 
aforesaid.  Forster  1  15  r. 

I  will  reduce  to  the  form  of  a  cube  every  rectangular  body  of  equi-

And  first  there  will  be  a  cylinder. 

To  get  the  square  of  a  rectangular  board  that  is  longer  than  it  is 
wide  according  to  a  given  breadth:  ask  yourself  by  how  much  its  size 
varies. 

This  may  be  done  by  the  fifth  of  this,  that  is  that  I  shall  make  of  the 
width  or  length  of  this  board  the  cylinder  of  length  equal  to  the  said 
width  or  length  of  the  board,  and  then  .  .  .  Forster  1  31  r. 

Geometry  extends  to  the  transmutations  of  metallic  bodies,  which 
are  of  substance  adapted  to  expansion  and  contraction  according  to  the 
necessities  of  their  observers. 

All  the  diminutions  of  cylinders  higher  than  the  cube  keep  the  name 
of  cylinder.  All  the  diminutions  of  the  cylinder  that  are  lower  than  the 
cube  are  named  boards.

When  you  wish  to  treat  of  pyramids  together  as  regards  their  in- 
crease or  diminution,  and  you  treat  of  cyclinders,  cubes  or  boards  which 
should  be  of  the  same  height  and  breadth  as  these  pyramids,  then  the 
third  of  these  bodies  will  remain  in  the  said  pyramid;  and  this  you  will 
put  concisely.  Forster  1  40  v.

METHODS  OF  MEASURING  A  HEIGHT 

Let  c  f  be  the  tower  you  wish  to  measure;  go  as  far  away  from  it  as 
you  think  desirable  and  take  the  range  of  it,  as  is  shown  in  c  b  a,  which 
may  be  the  length  of  an  arm  and  half  as  high,  and  work  it  so  that  the 
tower  occupies  the  space  b  a;  then  turn  the  line  b  a  along  the  level  of 
the  ground,  and  it  occupies  as  great  a  space  of  ground  as  it  occupied 
in  height,  and  in  the  space  of  ground  which  it  has  occupied  you  will 
find  the  true  altitude  of  the  tower.  Forster  i  48  v.

If  a  line  falls  perpendicularly  upon  another  line  it  ends  between  two 
right  angles. 

If  a  straight  line  falls  upon  another  straight  line  and  passes  to  the 
intersection  this  intersection  will  stand  in  the  middle  of  four  right 
angles. 

If  the  two  straight  lines  which  intersect  together  between  four  right 
angles  shall  have  their  four  extremities  equidistant  to  this  intersection, 
it  is  necessary  that  these  ends  be  also  equidistant  from  one  another.

If  two  circles  intersect  in  such  a  way  that  the  line  of  the  circumfer-

it,  these  circles  are  equal,  and  the  straight  lines  which  pass  from  the 
two  points  of  intersection  and  from  the  centre  to  the  other  intersect 
together  within  four  right  angles,  and  the  circle  made  upon  the  two 
centres  will  remain  divided  in  four  equal  parts  by  such  said  intersec- 
tion, and  there  will  be  made  a  perfect  square.  Forster  11  4  r. 

If  two  three  or  four  equal  things  are  placed  upon  a  thing  which  is

of  each  is  made  over  the  centres  of  each,  undoubtedly  these  will  be 
equal,  and  the  circle  where  such  intersection  is  made  remains  divided 
in  four  equal  parts,  and  it  is  in  the  proportion  of  a  half  to  each  of  the 
four  circles,  and  within  this  circle  will  be  formed  the  square  with

Gravity,  force  and  accidental  movement  together  with  percussion, 
are  the  four  accidental  powers  with  which  all  the  visible  works  of 
mortals  have  their  existence  and  their  end. 

GRAVITY 

Gravity  is  accidental  power,  which  is  created  by  movement  and  in- 
fused in  bodies  standing  out  of  their  natural  position. 

HEAVY  AND  LIGHT 

Gravity  and  lightness  are  equal  powers  created  by  the  one  element 
transferred  into  the  other;  in  every  function  they  are  so  alike  that  for  a 
single  power  which  may  be  named  they  have  merely  variation  in  the 
bodies  in  which  they  are  infused,  and  in  the  movement  of  their  creation 
and  deprivation. 

That  body  is  said  to  be  heavy  which  being  free  directs  its  movement 
to  the  centre  of  the  world  by  the  shortest  way. 

That  body  is  said  to  be  light  which  being  free  flees  from  this  centre 
of  the  world;  and  each  is  of  equal  power.  Forster  11  116  v. 

Gravity,  force,  together  with  percussion,  are  not  only  interchangeably 
to  be  called  mother  and  children  the  one  of  the  other  and  all  sisters  to- 
gether, because  they  may  be  produced  by  movement,  but  also  as  pro- 
ducers and  children  of  this  movement;  because  without  these  within  us 
movement  cannot  create,  nor  can  such  powers  be  revealed  without 
movement.  Forster  11  117  r. 

The  accidental  centre  of  the  gravity  that  descends  freely  will  always 
be  concentric  with  the  central  line  of  its  movement,  even  though  this 
gravity  should  revolve  in  its  descent.  Forster  11  125  v.

And  if  you  should  only  know  the  weight  of  the  thing  that  you

the  pounds  of  your  weight  by  the  number  of  the  wheels  that  there  are

which  will  resist  the  certain  with  equal  forces.  Forster  m  82  v. 

If  you  wish  with  certainty  to  understand  well  the  function  and  the 
force  of  the  tackle,  it  is  necessary  for  you  to  know  the  weight  of  the

know  that  of  the  thing  that  moves  multiply  it  by  the  number  of  the

Such  proportion  will  the  weight  have  which  is  suspended  by  means

If  you  multiply  the  number  of  the  pounds  that  your  body  weighs  by

That  wheel  of  which  the  centre  of  the  axis  is  the  centre  of  its  circle,

It  can  be  so  made  that  although  the  counterpoises  are  different  in 
weight  the  one  to  the  other  in  equal  arms  of  balances,  they  stand  at 
equal  resistance  the  one  to  the  other :  see  in  the  instrument  represented

In  proportion  as  the  number  of  the  wheels  is  greater  so  will  the  fall 
of  the  counterpoise  be  greater  than  the  rise  of  the  greater  weight. 

In  proportion  as  the  number  of  the  wheels  is  greater  so  will  the  num-

The  pulling  of  the  tackle  requires  force,  weight,  time  and  movement. 


OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  THE  CORDS 

As  many  as  may  be  the  number  of  the  wheels  of  the  tackle  so  much 
will  the  cord  be  swifter  in  its  first  movement  than  in  its  last. 


OF  THE  WEIGHT 

In  proportion  to  the  number  of  the  wheels  so  much  will  the  weight 
sustained  be  greater  than  that  which  supports  it.  Forster  in  86  r. 

[Sketch.  'Cord  of  the  windlass.'  'Multiply  that  weight  by  the  number 

of  the  wheels.'] 

If  you  wish  to  ascertain  how  much  cord  a  windlass  will  collect  after 
it  has  passed  through  the  whole  or  as  few  as  two  [turns]  of  a  tackle  of 
four  wheels,  know  that  for  every  braccio  that  the  weight  is  raised,  the 
windlass  will  collect  four  [braccia]  by  the  four  wheels  of  the  tackle; 
and  if  the  wheels  were  twenty,  for  every  braccio  that  the  weight  was 
raised  the  windlass  would  need  two  braccia  of  cord. 

In  the  raising  of  the  weight  the  windlass  would  need  as  many  times 
more  braccia  of  cord  than  the  weight  would  raise,  according  to  the 
number  of  the  wheels  which  are  collected  in  the  tackle. 

Forster  in  86  v. 

If  the  wheels  are  two  and  you  wish  to  raise  the  weight  one  braccio 
the  windlass  collects  two  braccia;  the  proof  is  this:  let  us  say  n  m  is 
one  braccio,  and  so  n  f  may  be  another;  let  us  say  that  I  wish  to  raise 
the  weight  m  one  braccio:  it  is  evident  that  the  cord  n  m  f  which  is 


MATHEMATICS  641 

two  braccia  will  be  no  more  in  its  position  and  the  windlass  will  gather 
up  as  much  again. 

In  proportion  to  the  number  of  the  wheels  that  move  in  the  tackles 
by  so  much  will  the  cord  of  the  first  movement  be  swifter  than  that  of 
the  last.  Forster  in  87  r. 

DEFINITION  OF  THE  NATURE  OF  THE  LINE 

The  line  has  not  in  itself  any  matter  or  substance  but  may  more 
readily  be  called  an  incorporeal  thing  than  a  substance,  and  being  of 
such  condition  it  does  not  occupy  space.  Therefore  the  intersections  of 
infinite  lines  may  be  conceived  of  as  made  at  a  point  which  has  no 
dimensions,  and  as  to  thickness,  if  such  a  term  can  be  employed,  is 
equal  to  the  thickness  of  one  single  line. 

HOW  WE  CONCLUDE  THAT  THE  SURFACE  TERMINATES 

IN  A  POINT 

An  angular  surface  becomes  reduced  to  a  point  when  it  reaches  its 
angle;  or  if  the  sides  of  this  angle  are  produced  in  a  straight  line,  then 
beyond  this  angle  there  is  formed  another  surface,  less  or  equal  or 
greater  than  the  first.  Windsor  mss.  r  47 

Every  point  is  the  head  of  an  infinite  number  of  lines,  which  com- 
bine to  form  a  base,  and  suddenly  from  the  said  base  by  the  same  lines 
converge  to  a  pyramid  showing  both  its  colour  and  its  form. 

No  sooner  is  the  form  created  or  compounded  than  suddenly  of  itself 
it  produces  infinite  angles  and  lines,  which  lines  spreading  themselves 
in  intersection  through  the  air  give  rise  to  an  infinite  number  of  angles 
opposite  to  one  another.  With  each  of  these  opposite  angles,  given  a 
base,  will  be  formed  a  triangle  alike  in  form  and  proportion  to  the 
greater  angle;  and  if  the  base  goes  twice  into  each  of  the  two  lines  of 
the  pyramid  it  will  be  the  same  with  the  lesser  triangle.

Archimedes  has  given  the  square  of  a  polygonal  figure,  but  not  of

If  into  a  vessel  that  is  filled  with  wine  as  much  water  is  made  to  en- 
ter as  equals  the  amount  of  the  wine  and  water  which  runs  out  of  it, 
the  said  vessel  can  never  be  altogether  deprived  of  wine.  This  follows 
from  the  fact  that  the  wine  being  a  continuous  quantity  is  divisible  to 
infinity,  and  therefore  if  in  a  certain  space  of  time  a  particular  quantity 
has  poured  away,  in  another  equal  space  of  time  half  the  quantity  will 
have  poured  away,  and  in  yet  another  a  fourth  of  the  quantity;  and 
what  is  left  is  constantly  being  replenished  with  water;  and  thus  always 
during  each  successive  space  of  time  the  half  of  what  remains  will  be 
poured  out.  Consequently,  as  it  is  capable  of  being  divided  to  infinity, 
the  continuous  quantity  of  the  aforesaid  wane  will  be  divided  during 
an  infinite  number  of  spaces  of  time;  and  because  the  infinite  has  no 
end  in  time  there  will  be  no  end  to  the  number  of  occasions  on  which 
the  wine  is  divided.  Leic.  26  v.

ments is  at  the  centre  of  their  gravity,  which  is  placed  in  the  middle

The  Nature  of  Water 

'As  from  the  said  pool  of  blood  proceed  the  veins 
which  spread  their  branches  through  the  human 
body,  in  just  the  same  manner  the  ocean  fills  the 
body  of  the  earth  with  an  infinite  number  of  veins 
of  water! 

If  a  drop  of  water  falls  into  the  sea  when  this  is  calm,  it  must  of  ne- 
cessity be  that  the  whole  surface  of  the  sea  is  raised  imperceptibly,  see- 
ing that  water  cannot  be  compressed  within  itself  like  air.  c.a.  20  r.  a 

Whether  the  surface  of  the  air  is  bounded  by  the  fire,  as  is  the  water 
by  the  air  and  the  earth  by  the  water,  and  whether  the  surface  of  the  air 
takes  waves  and  eddies  as  does  the  surface  of  the  water,  and  whether 
in  proportion  as  the  body  of  the  air  is  thinner  than  that  of  the  water  the 
revolutions  of  its  eddies  are  greater  in  number:  of  the  eddies  of  the 
water  some  have  their  centres  filled  with  air,  others  with  water.  I  do 
not  know  whether  it  is  the  same  with  the  eddies  of  the  surface  of  the 
fire.  Of  the  eddies  of  the  water  all  those  which  begin  at  the  surface  are 
filled  with  air,  and  those  that  have  their  origin  within  the  water  are 
filled  with  water;  and  these  are  more  lasting  because  water  within 
water  has  no  weight  as  water  has  when  it  is  above  the  air;  therefore 
the  eddies  of  the  water  round  the  air  have  weight  and  speedily  perish.

OF  THE  DELUGES  OF  THE  GREATEST  RIVERS 

The  deluges  of  rivers  are  created  when  the  mouths  of  the  valleys 
cannot  afford  egress  to  the  waters  that  they  receive  from  these  valleys 
as  rapidly  as  the  valleys  receive  them. 

The  progress  of  the  water  is  swifter  when  it  falls  at  a  greatei  angle. 

643 


644  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

OF  WAVES 

The  wave  is  the  recoil  of  the  stroke,  and  it  will  be  greater  or  less  in 
proportion  as  the  stroke  itself  is  greater  or  less.  A  wave  is  never  found 
alone,  but  is  mingled  with  as  many  other  waves  as  there  are  uneven 
places  in  the  object  where  the  said  wave  is  produced.  At  one  and  the 
same  time  there  will  be  moving  over  the  greatest  wave  of  a  sea  innum- 
erable other  waves  proceeding  in  different  directions.  If  you  throw  a 
stone  into  a  sea  with  various  shores,  all  the  waves  which  strike  against 
these  shores  are  thrown  back  toward  where  the  stone  has  struck,  and 
on  meeting  others  advancing  they  never  interrupt  each  other's  course. 
Waves  of  equal  volume,  velocity  and  power,  when  they  encounter  each 
other  in  opposing  motion,  recoil  at  right  angles,  the  one  from  the  stroke 
of  the  other.  That  wave  will  be  of  greater  elevation  which  is  created  by 
the  greater  stroke,  and  the  same  is  true  of  the  converse.  The  wave  pro- 
duced in  small  tracts  of  water  will  go  and  return  many  times  from  the 
spot  which  has  been  struck.  The  wave  goes  and  returns  so  many  more 
times  in  proportion  as  the  sea  which  produces  it  contains  a  less  quantity 
of  water,  and  so  conversely.  Only  in  the  high  seas  do  the  waves  advance 
without  ever  turning  in  recoil.  In  lesser  tracts  of  water  the  same  stroke 
gives  birth  to  many  motions  of  advance  and  recoil.  The  greatest  wave 
is  covered  with  innumerable  other  waves  moving  in  different  direc- 
tions; and  these  have  a  greater  or  less  depth  as  they  are  occasioned  by  a 
greater  or  less  power.  The  greatest  wave  is  covered  with  various  waves, 
which  move  in  as  many  different  directions  as  there  were  different 
places  from  which  they  separated  themselves.  The  same  wave  produced 
within  a  small  tract  of  water  has  a  greater  number  of  other  waves  pro- 
ceeding over  itself,  in  proportion  to  the  greater  strength  of  its  stroke 
and  recoil  from  the  opposite  shores.  Greater  is  the  motion  of  the  wave 
than  that  of  the  water  of  which  it  is  composed.  Many  waves  turned  in 
different  directions  can  be  created  between  the  surface  and  the  bottom 
of  the  same  body  of  water  at  the  same  time.  The  eddying  movements 
can  accompany  the  direct  movements  of  each  wave.  All  the  impressions 
caused  by  things  striking  upon  the  water  can  penetrate  one  another 
without  being  destroyed.  One  wave  never  penetrates  another;  but  they 
only  recoil  from  the  spot  where  they  strike.  c.a.  84  v.  a 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  645 

The  movement  of  water  within  water  proceeds  like  that  of  air 
within  air.  c.a.  108  v.  a 

Among  irremediable  and  destructive  terrors  the  inundations  caused 
by  rivers  in  flood  should  certainly  be  set  before  every  other  dreadful 
and  terrifying  movement,  nor  is  it,  as  some  have  thought,  surpassed  by 
destruction  by  fire.  I  find  it  to  be  the  contrary,  for  fire  consumes  that 
which  feeds  it  and  is  itself  consumed  with  its  food.  The  movement  of 
water  which  is  created  by  the  slopes  of  the  valleys  does  not  end  and  die 
until  it  has  reached  the  lowest  level  of  the  valley;  but  fire  is  caused  by 
what  feeds  it,  and  the  movement  of  water  by  its  wish  to  descend.  The 
food  of  the  fire  is  disunited,  and  the  mischief  caused  by  it  is  disunited 
and  separated,  and  the  fire  dies  when  it  lacks  food.  The  slope  of  the 
valley  is  continuous  and  the  mischief  done  by  the  destructive  course 
of  the  river  will  be  continuous  until,  attended  by  its  valleys,  it  ends 
in  the  sea,  the  universal  base  and  only  resting  place  of  the  wandering 
waters  of  the  rivers. 

But  in  what  terms  am  I  to  describe  the  abominable  and  awful  evils 
against  which  no  human  resource  avails?  Which  lay  waste  the  high 
mountains  with  their  swelling  and  exulting  waves,  cast  down  the 
strongest  banks,  tear  up  the  deep-rooted  trees,  and  with  ravening  waves 
laden  with  mud  from  crossing  the  ploughed  fields  carry  with  them  the 
unendurable  labours  of  the  wretched  weary  tillers  of  the  soil,  leaving 
the  valleys  bare  and  mean  by  reason  of  the  poverty  which  is  left  there. 

Among  irremediable  and  destructive  terrors  the  inundations  caused 
by  impetuous  rivers  ought  to  be  set  before  every  other  awful  and  terrify- 
ing source  of  injury.  But  in  what  tongue  or  with  what  words  am  I  to 
express  or  describe  the  awful  ruin,  the  inconceivable  and  pitiless  havoc, 
wrought  by  the  deluges  of  ravening  rivers,  against  which  no  human 
resource  can  avail?  c.a.  108  v.  b 

Prove  and  draw  up  the  rule  for  the  difference  that  there  is  between 
a  blow  given  by  water  upon  water,  and  by  water  falling  upon  some- 
thing hard;  and  consider  well  also  that  as  water  falls  upon  other  water, 
and  it  yields  space  to  the  blow,  the  percussion  making  the  water  open 
as  it  receives  the  blow,  so  the  same  result  will  occur  in  a  vase  when  the 
water  which  is  contained  within  it  has  been  struck,  for  it  will  be  the 


646  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

same  as  when  falling  water  has  struck  against  a  hard  substance  which 
resists  the  blow.  c.a.  153  v.  d 

OF  RIVERS  AND  THEIR  COURSES 

Among  straight  rivers  which  occur  in  land  of  the  same  character, 
with  the  same  abundance  of  water  and  with  equal  breadth,  length, 
depth,  and  declivity  of  course,  that  will  be  the  slower  which  is  the  more 
ancient. 

This  may  be  proved  with  straight  rivers.  That  will  be  most  winding 
which  is  the  oldest,  and  that  which  winds  will  become  slower  as  it 
acquires  greater  length. 

Of  waters  which  descend  from  equal  altitudes  to  equal  depths  that 
will  be  the  slower  which  moves  by  the  longer  way. 

Of  rivers  which  are  at  their  commencement  that  will  be  the  slower 
which  is  the  more  ancient,  and  this  arises  from  the  fact  that  the  course 
is  continually  acquiring  length  by  reason  of  the  additional  meander- 
ings  of  the  river;  and  the  reason  of  this  is  explained  in  the  twelfth 
section.  c.a.  156  r.  a 

The  cause  which  moves  the  humours  in  all  kinds  of  living  bodies 
contrary  to  the  natural  law  of  their  gravity,  is  really  that  which  moves 
the  water  pent  up  within  them  through  the  veins  of  the  earth  and  dis- 
tributes it  through  narrow  passages;  and  as  the  blood  that  is  low  rises 
up  high  and  streams  through  the  severed  veins  of  the  forehead,  or  as 
from  the  lower  part  of  the  vine  the  water  rises  up  to  where  its  branch 
has  been  lopped,  so  out  of  the  lowest  depths  of  the  sea  the  water  rises 
to  the  summits  of  the  mountains,  and  finding  there  the  veins  burst 
open  it  falls  through  them  and  returns  to  the  sea  below.  Thus  within 
and  without  it  goes,  ever  changing,  now  rising  with  fortuitous  move- 
ment and  now  descending  in  natural  liberty. 

So  united  together  it  goes  ranging  about  in  continual  revolution. 

Rushing  now  here  now  there,  up  and  down,  never  resting  at  all  in 
quiet  either  in  its  course  or  in  its  own  nature,  it  has  nothing  of  its  own 
but  seizes  hold  on  everything,  assuming  as  many  different  natures  as 
the  places  are  different  through  which  it  passes,  acting  just  as  the 
mirror  does  when  it  assumes  within  itself  as  many  images  as  are  the 
objects  which  pass  before  it.  So  it  is  in  a  state  of  continual  change, 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  647 

sometimes  of  position  and  sometimes  of  colour,  now  enclosing  in  itself 
new  scents  and  savours,  now  keeping  new  essences  or  qualities,  show- 
ing itself  now  deadly  now  lifegiving,  at  one  time  dispersing  itself 
through  the  air,  at  another  suffering  itself  to  be  sucked  up  by  the  heat, 
and  now  arriving  at  the  region  of  cold  where  the  heat  that  was  its  guide 
is  restricted  by  it. 

And  as  when  the  hand  under  water  squeezes  a  sponge  so  that  the 
water  that  escapes  from  it  creates  a  wave  that  passes  through  the  other 
water,  even  so  does  the  air  that  was  mingled  with  the  water  when  the 
cold  *  is  squeezed  out,  flee  away  in  fury  and  drive  out  the  other  air; 
this  then  is  the  course  of  the  wind. 

And  as  the  hand  which  squeezes  the  sponge  under  water  when  it  is 
well  soaked,  so  that  the  water  pent  up  within  it  is  compelled  to  flee 
away  and  therefore  is  driven  by  force  through  the  other  water  and 
penetrates  it,  and  this  second  mass  perceiving  itself  to  be  struck  de- 
parts in  a  wave  from  its  position,  even  so  the  new  .  .  .  makes  .  .  . 

c.a.  171  r.  a 

The  sharp  bends  made  in  the  embankments  of  rivers  are  destroyed 
in  the  great  floods  of  the  rivers  because  the  maximum  current  drives 
the  water  in  a  straight  course.  But  as  this  diminishes  it  resumes  its 
winding  course,  during  which  it  is  being  continually  diverted  from 
one  bank  to  another,  and  as  it  thus  grows  less  the  embankment  of  the 
river  becomes  hollowed  out. 

But  in  this  lesser  depth  the  water  does  not  move  with  uniform 
course,  because  the  greater  current  leaps  from  one  hollow  to  another 
of  the  opposite  banks,  and  the  sides  of  the  water  which  border  upon 
the  embankment  have  the  shortest  course. 

The  rotundities  in  the  islands  of  shingle  formed  by  the  angles  of  the 
embankment  trace  their  origin  to  the  chief  eddies  of  the  rivers,  which 
extend  with  their  revolutions  among  the  concavities  and  convexities 
which  are  found  alternately  in  the  embankments  of  the  rivers;  and 
from  these  spring  the  tiny  brooks,  interposed  between  the  sandbanks 
of  the  rivers  and  their  embankments,  and  placed  opposite  to  the  hol- 
lows of  the  embankments  of  these  rivers.

648  THE  NATURE   OF   WATER 

The  entry  of  river  into  river  produces  the  first  meanderings  of  the 
river. 

The  meanderings  of  rivers  in  plains  are  occasioned  by  the  rivers 
emptying  themselves  there. 

If  the  winding  river  be  altogether  removed  from  its  ancient  bed  and 
set  in  a  straight  channel,  it  is  necessary  that  the  rivers  which  pour 
themselves  into  it  from  two  sides  increase  in  length  on  the  one  side 
as  much  as  they  lose  it  on  the  other,  the  one  that  acquires  length  losing 
in  swiftness,  this  swiftness  being  transferred  to  the  one  that  grows 
shorter. 

Cause  the  lesser  rivers  to  enter  into  the  greater  rivers  at  acute  angles; 
the  advantage  of  this  will  be  that  the  current  of  the  greater  river  di- 
verts the  line  of  entry  of  the  lesser  river  and  does  not  suffer  it  to  strike 
against  the  opposite  bank. 

Should  however  the  lesser  river  be  in  flood  at  the  time  when  the 
waters  of  the  greater  river  are  low  the  percussion  of  the  lesser  river 
will  break  the  opposite  bank  of  this  greater  river. 

The  largest  of  the  curves  of  a  river  in  a  valley  will  always  have  its 
convex  side  facing  the  lower  part  of  the  breadth  of  the  valley. 

The  meanderings  of  rivers  are  always  greater  in  proportion  as  they 
are  nearer  to  the  spot  where  the  lesser  river  enters  the  greater. 

The  waves  of  earth  formed  by  the  embankment  of  the  rivers  are 
continually  changing  their  positions,  the  former  being  created  anew 
where  the  latter  have  been  washed  away.  c.a.  185  r.  b 

Prove  whether  a  triangle  thrown  into  still  water  makes  its  wave  of

[Sketch — figure  of  bubble  resting  on  water] 

Why  the  bubbles  which  the  water  makes  are  half-spheres  and  those 
of  the  air  are  perfect  spheres.  Why  the  sides  of  the  base  of  the  half- 
sphere  are  spherical  rectangles,  and  the  contact  which  each  has  with 
the  water  does  not  cause  it  to  form  a  projection  above  it  but  on  account 
of  its  weight  it  has  to  bend  and  curve.  c.a.  209  r.  a 

[With  drawing] 

The  water  that  falls  down  from  a  height,  will  create  a  deep  pool, 
which  will  continually  increase,  and  its  banks  will  often  fall  in.  And 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  649 

the  reason  of  this  is  that  the  water,  which  falls  upon  the  other  water, 
by  the  swiftness  of  its  blow  and  by  its  weight  causes  it  to  give  place, 
and  passes  down  to  its  depths  where  it  forms  a  hollow  space,  and 
through  the  stroke  and  the  air,  which  as  it  falls  is  buried  with  it,  it 
comes  to  rise  up  again  and  raise  itself  to  a  height  by  various  channels, 
which  expand  like  an  opening  bud,  and  the  stroke  of  the  water  upon 
the  bank  proceeds  in  a  circle  and  thus  continuing  it  will  gnaw  and 
consume  the  surrounding  shores.  c.a.  215  v.  d 

The  air  by  its  nature  does  not  flee  away  beneath  the  water;  but  the 
water  which  is  supported  round  about  it  presses  it  out  of  itself  and 
drives  it  forth. 

Therefore  one  element  does  not  flee  away  of  itself  out  of  the  other 
element,  but  is  driven  out  by  it.  c.a.  244  v.  a 

OF  THE  FLOW  AND  EBB  OF  THE  SEA  AND  ITS  VARIETY 

The  flow  and  ebb  of  the  sea  are  due  to  the  course  of  the  rivers,  which 
give  the  water  back  again  to  the  sea  with  slower  movement  than  the 
movement  of  their  own  current;  and  on  this  account  necessity  causes 
the  water  to  rise  to  a  height.  And  this  river  covers  up  its  current  again 
with  the  swift  wave  which  in  its  recoil  goes  to  meet  the  descending 
current  of  the  river. 

The  wave  of  the  river  flows  back  against  its  current  when  the  sea 
is  at  its  ebb.  After  the  return  of  the  wave  to  the  shore  it  there  acquires 
new  power  from  the  approach  of  the  river. 

The  flow  and  ebb  of  the  sea  are  not  caused  by  the  moon  or  the  sun, 
but  by  the  greatest  wave  as  it  advances  and  falls  back.  But  since  the 
recoil  is  weaker  than  the  advancing  movement,  as  it  is  deprived  of 
support,  this  hesitating  movement  would  consume  itself  if  it  were  not 
renewed  by  the  help  of  the  rivers;  for  these  being  immediately  swollen 
by  the  approaching  wave  of  the  aforesaid  tide,  the  wave  produced  by 
this  swollen  river  becomes  added  to  this  ebb,  and  it  strikes  the  opposite 
shores  of  the  islands  set  over  against  it,  and  then  leaps  back,  and  so 
returns  in  its  former  course,  and  so  continues,  as  has  been  said  above. 

This  experience  has  taught  us,  for  it  is  seen  continually  in  every 
river,  and  especially  as  it  strikes  against  the  sides  of  its  bays.

650  THE  NATURE  OF   WATER 

The  spiral  or  rotary  movement  of  every  liquid  is  so  much  the  swifter 
in  proportion  as  it  is  nearer  to  the  centre  of  its  revolution. 

This  that  we  set  forth  is  a  circumstance  worthy  of  note;  since  move- 
ment in  the  circular  wheel  is  so  much  slower  as  it  is  nearer  to  the  centre 
of  the  revolving  object.  But  this  same  circumstance  is  shown  in  the 
similarity  of  movement  both  as  to  speed  and  length  in  each  complete 
revolution  of  the  water,  both  in  the  circumference  of  its  greater  and  of 
its  lesser  circle;  but  the  curve  of  the  lesser  circle  is  as  much  less  than 
that  of  the  greater  as  the  greater  circle  is  more  curved  than  the  lesser. 
And  so  this  water  is  of  uniform  movement  in  all  the  processes  of  its 
revolution,  and  if  it  were  not  so  the  concavity  would  instantly  be  filled 
up  again.  But  because  the  lateral  weight  of  this  eddying  mass  1  is  two- 
fold, such  concavity  has  no  permanent  movement,  and  of  such  dupli- 
cation of  weight  the  first  comes  into  being  in  the  revolving  movement 
of  the  water,  the  second  is  created  in  the  sides  of  this  concavity,  and  it 
supports  itself  there  and  finally  falls  headlong  down  upon  the  air  which 
has  filled  up  the  aforesaid  cavity  with  itself. 

The  movements  of  the  air  through  the  air  are  two,  that  is  straight  in 
the  form  of  a  column  upwards,  and  with  revolving  movement. 

But  water  makes  this  movement  downwards,  and  makes  it  in  the 
form  of  a  pyramid,  and  makes  it  so  much  the  more  swiftly  as  the 
pyramid  is  more  pointed.  c.a.  296  v.  b 

OF  THE  UTILITY  OF  THE  SCIENCE  OF  WATER 

There  were  many  of  the  chief  towns  of  the  districts  which,  through 
being  placed  upon  their  chief  rivers,  have  been  consumed  and  de- 
stroyed by  these  rivers,  as  was  Babylon  by  the  Tigris,  by  means  of 
Cyrus  .  .  .  and  so  with  an  infinite  number  of  regions;  and  the  science 
of  water  gives  exact  information  as  to  their  defences.        c.a.  305  r.  a 

Water  falling  perpendicularly  into  running  water  makes  a  curve  as 
it  enters  and  a  curve  as  it  rises.  The  summit  of  the  part  that  rises  in  the 
air  will  not  be  in  the  centre  of  the  base  of  this  cavity,  and  this  base  will 
be  oval.  c.a.  343  v.  a

THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  651 

OF  RIVERS 

The  water  falls  in  whatever  is  the  line  of  the  summit  of  its  wave, 
and  it  moves  more  swiftly  where  this  fall  has  less  slant,  and  breaks 
more  into  foam  where  it  meets  with  more  resistance. 

There,  according  to  what  has  been  stated,  the  waves  break  against 
the  course  of  the  river  and  never  in  the  direction  of  its  course,  because 
water  falling  upon  flowing  water  can  never  create  a  rebound  upon 
something  that  flies  away  and  does  not  await  the  stroke;  but  in  the 
case  of  the  opposite  descent  towards  the  course  of  the  water,  the  water 
in  the  wave  as  it  falls  against  the  course  of  the  river  does  not  come 
upon  water  which  flies  away  from  its  stroke,  but  upon  water  which  is 
proceeding  in  the  opposite  direction  to  this  fall;  and  consequently  as 
the  wave  in  its  fall  has  four  degrees  of  velocity  and  the  water  that 
comes  to  meet  it  is  also  of  four  degrees  of  velocity,  the  impetus  of  the 
wave  acquires  eight  degrees  of  velocity,  and  therefore  waves  of  rivers 
break  against  their  current,  and  that  of  the  sea  breaks  against  the  water 
that  flies  back  from  the  shore  against  which  it  has  struck,  and  not 
against  the  wind  that  drives  it.  c.a.  354  r.  b 

OF  THE  FLOW  AND  EBB  OF  THE  WATERS 

Every  movement  of  water  creates  flow  and  ebb  in  every  part  of  the 
river  where  the  swiftness  of  its  course  checks  it. 

This  is  proved  by  the  fact  that  where  the  course  of  the  river  is  steeper 
it  is  swifter;  and  where  it  is  more  level  it  is  slower.  Therefore  the  level 
sea  receives  more  water  than  it  discharges;  for  which  reason  it  is  nec- 
essary for  the  water  of  the  sea  to  rise  to  such  a  height  that  its  weight 
overcomes  the  water  that  drives  it;  and  then  this  water  which  has  been 
driven  descends  from  its  height  round  about  the  base  of  the  aforesaid 
hill,  and  that  part  which  descends  against  the  current  mentioned  before 
swells  this  current  up  in  such  a  way  that  the  upper  part  of  its  water  is 
retarded,  until  the  water  that  follows  becoming  more  abundant  subdues 
the  ebb  and  creates  a  new  flow.  c.a.  354  r.  e 

The  impetus  made  in  the  great  current  of  the  water  preserves  its  line 
among  the  motionless  waves  as  the  solar  ray  may  do  in  the  course  of 
the  winds. 


652  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

At  one  time  the  wave  of  the  impetus  is  motionless  amid  the  great 
current  of  the  water,  at  another  it  is  extremely  swift  in  the  motionless 
water,  that  is  on  the  surface  of  the  swamps. 

Why  does  a  blow  upon  the  water  create  many  waves?  c.a.  354  v.  a 

The  river  which  has  always  depth  at  the  centre  of  its  course  will  keep 
within  its  banks. 

Where  the  channel  is  more  confined,  there  the  water  runs  more 
strongly  than  elsewhere,  and  as  it  issues  from  the  straight  it  spreads 
itself  furiously,  and  strikes  and  wears  away  the  near  banks  which  lie 
across  its  course,  and  often  changes  its  course  from  one  place  to  another. 

c.a.  361  r.  b 

The  movement  of  the  wind  resembles  that  of  the  water. 

What  is  the  difference  between  water  which  is  drawn  and  water 
which  is  driven? 

Water  which  is  drawn  is  when  the  Ocean  as  it  falls  draws  after  it  the 
water  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea. 

Water  driven  is  that  caused  by  the  rivers  which,  as  they  come  into  the 
sea,  drive  its  water. 

Amid  all  the  causes  of  the  destruction  of  human  property,  it  seems 
to  me  that  rivers  on  account  of  their  excessive  and  violent  inundations 
hold  the  foremost  place.  And  if  as  against  the  fury  of  impetuous  rivers 
any  one  should  wish  to  uphold  fire,  such  a  one  would  seem  to  me  to  be 
lacking  in  judgment,  for  fire  remains  spent  and  dead  when  fuel  fails  it, 
but  against  the  irreparable  inundation  caused  by  swollen  and  proud 
rivers  no  resource  of  human  foresight  can  avail;  for  in  a  succession  of 
raging  and  seething  [waves],  gnawing  and  tearing  away  the  high 
banks,  growing  turbid  with  the  earth  from  the  ploughed  fields,  destroy- 
ing the  houses  therein  and  uprooting  the  tall  trees,  it  carries  these  as  its 
prey  down  to  the  sea  which  is  its  lair,  bearing  along  with  it  men,  trees, 
animals,  houses  and  lands,  sweeping  away  every  dike  and  every  kind  of 
barrier,  bearing  with  it  the  light  things,  and  devastating  and  destroying 
those  of  weight,  creating  big  landslips  out  of  small  fissures,  filling  up 
with  its  floods  the  low  valleys,  and  rushing  headlong  with  insistent  and 
inexorable  mass  of  waters. 

What  a  need  there  is  of  flight  for  whoso  is  near!  O  how  many  cities, 
how  many  lands,  castles,  villas  and  houses  has  it  consumed! 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  653 

How  many  of  the  labours  of  wretched  husbandmen  have  been  ren- 
dered idle  and  profitless!  How  many  families  has  it  brought  to  naught, 
and  overwhelmed!  What  shall  I  say  of  the  herds  of  cattle  which  have 
been  drowned  and  lost! 

And  often  issuing  forth  from  its  ancient  rocky  beds  it  washes  over 
the  tilled  [lands]  .  .  .  c.a.  361  v.  a 

Where  the  channel  of  the  river  is  more  sloping  the  water  has  a 
swifter  current;  and  where  the  water  is  swifter  it  wears  the  bed  of  its 
river  more  away  and  deepens  it  more  and  causes  the  same  quantity  of 
water  to  occupy  less  space. 

The  shorter  the  course  of  the  rivers  the  greater  will  be  their  speed. 
And  so  also  conversely  it  will  be  slower  in  proportion  as  their  course  has 
greater  length. 

Where  the  superabundance  of  the  water  is  not  received  within  the 
depth  of  its  channel,  necessity  causes  it  to  fall  precipitately  outside  its 
banks. 

No  part  of  an  element  possesses  weight  within  its  element  unless  it  is 
either  moved  within  it  with  impetus,  or  falls  down  within  it,  being 
drawn  by  it  from  within  another  element.  c.a.  365  r.  a 

The  course  of  a  smaller  flood  of  water  conforms  to  that  of  the  larger 
of  the  great  floods,  and  changes  course  and  keeps  company  with  it  and 
ceases  to  delve  under  the  banks. 

The  proof  of  this  is  seen  in  the  Po.  For  when  it  is  low  its  water  runs 
many  times  in  cross-currents,  and  called  by  the  low  places  and  directing 
its  way  towards  these  it  takes  its  course  and  strikes  the  bank  in  its 
foundations,  and  hollows  these  out  causing  wide  destruction.  But  when 
it  flows  in  full  stream  the  lesser  quantity  which  formerly  with  its  cross- 
current had  beaten  upon  the  banks  and  hollowed  them,  abandons  its 
course,  being  dragged  in  company  with  the  greater  volume  of  water 
and  advancing  along  the  line  of  its  base  it  forbears  to  damage  its  banks. 

a  23  v. 

The  water  which  falls  by  the  line  nearest  to  the  vertical  is  that  which 
descends  most  rapidly  and  gives  itself  with  greatest  blow  and  greatest 
weight  to  the  spot  on  which  it  strikes. 


654  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

Every  stream  of  water  when  near  to  its  fall  will  have  the  curve  of  the 
descent  commencing  on  the  surface  before  it  commences  in  the  depth. 

a  24  r. 

Water  is  by  its  weight  the  second  element  that  encompasses  the  earth, 
and  that  part  of  it  which  is  outside  its  sphere  will  seek  with  rapidity  to 
return  there.  And  the  farther  it  is  raised  above  the  position  of  its  ele- 
ment the  greater  the  speed  with  which  it  will  descend  to  it.  Its  qualities 
are  dampness  and  cold.  It  is  its  nature  to  search  always  for  the  low- 
lying  places  when  without  restraint.  Readily  it  rises  up  in  steam  and 
mist,  and  changed  into  cloud  falls  back  again  in  rain  as  the  minute 
parts  of  the  cloud  attach  themselves  together  and  form  drops.  And  at 
different  altitudes  it  assumes  different  forms,  namely  water  or  snow  01 
hail.  Constantly  it  is  buffeted  by  the  movement  of  the  air,  and  it 
attaches  itself  to  that  body  on  which  the  cold  has  most  effect,  and  it 
takes  with  ease  odours  and  flavours.  a  26  r. 

It  is  not  possible  that  dead  water  should  be  the  cause  of  movement 
either  of  itself  or  of  anything  else.  a  43  r. 

THE  BEGINNING  OF  THE  TREATISE  ON  WATER 

Man  has  been  called  by  the  ancients  a  lesser  world,  and  indeed  the 
term  is  rightly  applied,  seeing  that  if  man  is  compounded  of  earth, 
water,  air  and  fire,  this  body  of  the  earth  is  the  same;  and  as  man  has 
within  himself  bones  as  a  stay  and  framework  for  the  flesh,  so  the  world 
has  the  rocks  which  are  the  supports  of  the  earth;  as  man  has  within 
him  a  pool  of  blood  wherein  the  lungs  as  he  breathes  expand  and  con- 
tract, so  the  body  of  the  earth  has  its  ocean,  which  also  rises  and  falls 
every  six  hours  with  the  breathing  of  the  world;  as  from  the  said  pool 
of  blood  proceed  the  veins  which  spread  their  branches  through  the 
human  body,  in  just  the  same  manner  the  ocean  fills  the  body  of  the 
earth  with  an  infinite  number  of  veins  of  water.  In  this  body  of  the 
earth  there  is  lacking,  however,  the  sinews,  and  these  are  absent  because 
sinews  are  created  for  the  purpose  of  movement,  and  as  the  world  is 
perpetually  stable  within  itself  no  movement  ever  takes  place  there,  and 
in  the  absence  of  any  movement  the  sinews  are  not  necessary;  but  in 
all  other  things  man  and  the  world  show  a  great  resemblance. 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  655 

OF  THE  SPRINGS  OF  WATER  ON  THE  TOPS  OF  MOUNTAINS 

Clearly  it  would  seem  that  the  whole  surface  of  the  ocean  when  not 
0  fleeted  by  tempest  is  equally  distant  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  and 
that  the  tops  of  the  mountains  are  as  much  farther  removed  from  this 
centre  as  they  rise  above  the  surface  of  the  sea.  Unless  therefore  the 
body  of  the  earth  resembled  that  of  man  it  would  not  be  possible  that 
the  water  of  the  sea  being  so  much  lower  than  the  mountains  should 
have  power  in  its  nature  to  rise  to  the  summit  of  the  mountains.  We 
must  needs  therefore  believe  that  the  same  cause  that  keeps  the  blood  at 
the  top  of  a  man's  head  keeps  water  at  the  summit  of  mountains. 


OF  THE  HEAT  THAT  IS  IN  THE  WORLD 

Where  there  is  life  there  is  heat,  and  where  there  is  vital  heat  there  is 
movement  of  vapour.  This  is  proved  because  one  sees  that  the  heat  of 
the  element  of  fire  always  draws  to  itself  the  damp  vapours,  the  thick 
mists  and  dense  clouds,  which  are  given  off  by  the  seas  and  other  lakes 
and  rivers  and  marshy  valleys.  And  drawing  these  little  by  little  up  to 
the  cold  region,  there  the  first  part  halts,  because  the  warm  and  moist 
cannot  exist  with  cold  and  dryness;  and  this  first  part  having  halted 
receives  the  other  parts,  and  so  all  the  parts  joining  together  one  to 
another  form  thick  and  dark  clouds. 

And  these  are  often  swept  away  and  carried  by  the  winds  from  one 
region  to  another,  until  at  last  their  density  gives  them  such  weight 
that  they  fall  in  thick  rain;  but,  if  the  heat  of  the  sun  is  added  to  the 
power  of  the  element  of  fire,  the  clouds  are  drawn  up  higher  and  come 
to  more  intense  cold,  and  there  become  frozen  and  so  produce  hail- 
storms. 

So  the  same  heat  which  holds  up  so  great  a  weight  of  water  as  is  seen 
to  fall  in  rain  from  the  clouds  sucks  it  up  from  below  from  the  roots  of 
the  mountains  and  draws  it  up  and  confines  it  among  the  mountain 
summits,  and  there  the  water  finds  crevices,  and  so  continuing  it  issues 
forth  and  creates  rivers.  a  54  v. 

If  heat  is  the  cause  of  the  movement  of  moisture  cold  stops  it.  This 
has  been  already  shown  by  the  example  of  the  cold  region  which  stops 


656  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

the  clouds  drawn  by  the  hot  element.  As  for  the  proof  that  the  heat 
draws  the  moisture  it  is  shown  as  follows: — heat  a  jug  and  set  it  in  a 
vase  with  the  mouth  downwards,  and  place  there  some  charcoal  which 
has  been  lighted.  You  will  see  that  the  moisture  as  it  retires  before  the 
heat  will  rise  and  fill  the  jug  with  water,  and  the  air  which  was 
enclosed  in  this  jug  will  escape  through  its  opening. 

Also  if  you  take  a  wet  cloth  and  hold  it  to  the  fire  you  will  see  the 
damp  of  the  cloth  leave  its  place,  and  that  part  of  the  moisture  which 
has  least  substance  will  rise  up,  drawn  by  the  proximity  of  the  fire 
which  from  its  nature  rises  towards  the  region  of  its  element.  In  this 
way  the  sun  draws  up  the  moisture. 


EXPLANATION  OF  THE  PRESENCE  OF  WATER  AT  THE 
SUMMITS  OF  THE  MOUNTAINS 

I  say  that  it  is  just  like  the  blood  which  the  natural  heat  keeps  in  the 
veins  at  the  top  of  the  man,  and  when  the  man  has  died  this  blood 
becomes  cold  and  is  brought  back  into  the  low  parts,  and  as  the  sun 
warms  the  man's  head  the  amount  of  blood  there  increases,  and  it 
grows  to  such  an  excess  there  with  the  humours  as  to  overload  the  veins 
and  frequently  to  cause  pains  in  the  head.  It  is  the  same  with  the 
springs  which  ramify  through  the  body  of  the  earth  and,  by  the  natural 
heat  which  is  spread  through  all  the  body  that  contains  them,  the 
water  stays  in  the  springs  and  is  raised  to  the  high  summits  of  the 
mountains.  And  the  water  that  passes  through  a  pent-up  channel  within 
the  body  of  the  mountain  like  a  dead  thing  will  not  emerge  from  its 
first  low  state,  because  it  is  not  warmed  by  the  vital  heat  of  the  first 
spring.  Moreover  the  warmth  of  the  element  of  fire,  and  by  day  the 
heat  of  the  sun,  have  power  to  stir  up  the  dampness  of  the  low  places 
and  draw  this  to  a  height  in  the  same  way  as  it  draws  the  clouds  and 
calls  up  their  moisture  from  the  expanses  of  the  sea.  a  56  r. 

Of  the  opinion  held  by  some  that  the  water  of  some  seas  is  higher 
than  the  highest  summits  of  the  mountains  and  that  the  water  was 
driven  up  to  these  summits: 

Water  will  not  move  from  one  spot  to  another  unless  to  seek  a  lower 
level,  and  in  the  natural  course  of  its  current  it  will  never  be  able  to 


THE   NATURE  OF   WATER  657 

return  to  an  elevation  equal  to  that  of  the  spot  whence  it  first  issued 
forth  from  the  mountains  and  came  into  the  light.  That  part  of  the  sea 
which  by  an  error  of  imagination  you  state  to  have  been  so  high  as  to 
have  flowed  over  the  summits  of  the  high  mountains  for  so  many 
centuries,  would  be  consumed  and  poured  out  in  the  water  that  has 
issued  from  these  same  mountains.  You  can  well  imagine  that  during 
all  the  time  that  the  Tigris  and  the  Euphrates  have  flowed  from  the 
summits  of  the  Armenian  mountains,1  one  may  suppose  the  whole  of 
the  water  of  the  ocean  to  have  passed  a  great  many  times  through  their 
mouths. 

Or  do  you  not  believe  that  the  Nile  has  discharged  more  water  into 
the  sea  than  is  at  present  contained  in  all  the  watery  element?  Surely 
this  is  the  case.  If  then  this  water  had  fallen  away  from  the  body  of  the 
earth,  the  whole  mechanism  would  long  since  have  been  without  water. 
So  therefore,  one  may  conclude  that  the  water  passes  from  the  rivers  to 
the  sea,  and  from  the  sea  to  the  rivers,  ever  making  the  self-same  round, 
and  that  all  the  sea  and  the  rivers  have  passed  through  the  mouth  of  the 
Nile  an  infinite  number  of  times.  a  56  r  and  v. 


OF  THE  FOAM  OF  WATER 

Water  which  falls  from  a  height  into  other  water  imprisons  within 
itself  a  certain  quantity  of  air,  and  this  through  the  force  of  the  blow 
becomes  submerged  with  it.  Then  with  swift  movement  it  rises  up 
again  and  arrives  at  the  surface  which  it  has  quitted,  clothed  with  a  fine 
veil  of  moisture  spherical  in  form,  and  proceeds  by  circles  away  from 
the  spot  where  it  first  struck.  Or  the  water  which  falls  down  upon  other 
water  runs  away  from  the  spot  where  it  strikes,  in  various  different 
branches,  bifurcating  and  mingling  and  interlacing  one  with  another; 
and  some,  being  hollow,  are  dashed  back  upon  the  surface  of  the  water; 
and  so  great  is  the  force  of  the  weight,  and  of  the  shock  caused  by  this 
water,  that  through  its  extreme  swiftness  the  air  is  unable  to  escape  into 
its  own  element,  but  on  the  contrary  is  submerged  in  the  manner  that 
I  have  stated  above.

658  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

WHY  RIVERS  CHANGE  THEIR  POSITION  AND  OFTEN  RAISE 
THEMSELVES  AND  MOUNT  UPWARDS  IN  VARIOUS  PLACES 

The  movement  of  water  tends  always  to  wear  away  its  support;  and 
the  part  which  is  the  softest  offers  the  least  resistance,  and  as  it  vacate: 
its  place  it  leaves  various  hollows  in  which  the  water,  whirling  round 
in  divers  eddies,  wears  away  and  hollows  out  and  increases  these 
chasms,  and  striking  against  the  newly-bared  dikes  leaps  back  and 
strikes  upon  the  banks,  consuming  and  eating  away  and  destroying 
whatever  stands  in  its  path,  changing  its  course  in  the  midst  of  the 
havoc  it  has  made,  dragging  with  it  in  its  course  the  lightest  of  the  soil 
and  then  depositing  it  in  the  parts  that  are  more  tranquil.  As  it  raises 
its  bed  the  quantity  and  force  of  the  water  is  lessened  and  its  fury  is 
transferred  to  the  opposite  side,  and  when  it  reaches  the  bank  it  eats  it 
away  and  lays  its  foundations  bare  until  with  great  destruction  it  has 
uncovered  new  ground.  If  it  should  find  a  plain  it  covers  it,  and  carry- 
ing away  and  hollowing  out  it  forms  a  new  bed,  and  if  it  should  come 
upon  buried  stones  it  uncovers  them  and  lays  them  bare.  But  it  often 
happens  that  these,  because  of  their  size,  make  resistance  to  the 
impetuous  flood,  and  so  after  being  driven  against  the  rocks  that  are 
in  the  middle  of  its  course  it  leaps  back  towards  the  opposite  side,  break- 
ing and  destroying  the  opposite  bank.  a  59  r. 

WHY  WATER  DIGS  OUT  ROUND  PITS  WHEN  IT  FALLS 
WITH  VIOLENCE 

Water  which  falls  in  the  manner  stated  does  not  enlarge  its  pit,  foi 
as  the  fact  of  it  falling  perpendicularly  shows,  there  is  but  little  force  in 
the  water  that  drives  it  from  behind,  and  this  is  why  it  falls  all  broken 
and  in  fine  spray  almost  in  a  perpendicular  line.  And  the  air  which  is 
amidst  this  broken  water  having  an  almost  equal  weight  above  it  cannot 
escape  so  quickly  as  not  to  be  submerged  by  the  weight  together  with 
the  blow.  But,  since  air  cannot  be  disunited  from  its  element  without 
violence,  after  yielding  to  the  fury  of  the  blow  and  the  weight,  it  rises 
again  quickly  and  returns  to  the  surface  in  round  bubbles  near  to  the 
spot  that  was  struck,  and  so  as  it  does  not  move  any  distance  from  this 
spot  it  does  not  cause  any  damage  to  the  banks  of  the  pit.  But  when  the 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  659 

rushing  river,  swollen  by  recent  rains,  scours  its  banks,  it  falls  in  tiny 
into  the  lower  waters,  and  no  longer  as  formerly  descending  peacefully 
ill  a  shower  mingled  with  air  upon  the  other  water  but  united  and 
strong,  strikes  and  tears  open  the  smitten  depths  right  down  to  their 
rocky  bed,  uncovering  and  carrying  away  the  buried  stones,  setting  up 
for  itself  a  new  barrier  in  the  shingle  carried  from  the  pit  which  it  has 
made  it  throws  itself  upon  it  and  falls  back  beaten,  and  divides  at  the 
blow  into  two  different  streams  which  separate  and  form  half-circles, 
devouring  and  consuming  every  obstacle  and  enlarging  their  bed  in  the 
form  of  a  circle. 

To  put  it  more  exactly — when  the  rivers  are  in  flood,  the  falls  of  the 
water  are  less  abrupt,  and  therefore,  as  the  mass  of  water  strikes  the 
lower  levels,  the  water  which  follows  the  blow  does  not  hasten  with 
the  violence  of  that  which  falls,  and  this  being  the  case  it  offers  resist- 
ance and  thus  offering  resistance  the  water  rises  and  the  fall  becomes 
shorter.  In  consequence  it  does  not  imprison  so  much  air,  because  the 
lower  parts  of  the  water  are  hardly  separated  from  the  rest  in  its  fall 
and,  owing  to  this,  very  little  air  can  enter,  and  therefore  the  blow  and 
weight  of  the  water  meet  with  no  resistance,  and  the  blow  proceeds 
without  diminishment  right  down  to  the  bottom,  displacing  the  gravel 
that  is  there  and  surrounding  and  clothing  the  stones  with  itself  and 
increasing  the  depth  of  the  pools.  a  59  r.  and  v. 

OF  THE  WAY  IN  WHICH  PITS  ARE  FORMED  IN  THE 
COURSES  OF  RIVERS 

The  reason  is  that  in  the  beds  of  rivers  there  are  always  found  stones 
of  different  sizes,  and  as  the  water,  coming  to  the  largest,  sinks  down 
behind  them  and  smites  the  spot  on  which  it  falls,  the  blow  dislodges 
the  lesser  stones  from  the  spot  on  which  it  strikes,  and  the  bed  is  made 
larger.  As  the  fall  increases  it  becomes  more  powerful  and  hollows  out 
even  more  the  pit  which  has  been  begun;  and  this  occurs  because  the 
rivers  constantly  gnaw  the  mud  of  their  bed  and  constantly  uncover 
and  lay  bare  rocks  of  different  forms  and  sizes. 


660  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

WHY   THE   SURFACE   OF   FLOWING   RIVERS   PRESENTS 
ALWAYS  PROTUBERANCES  AND  HOLLOWS 

The  reason  of  this  is  that  just  as  a  pair  of  stockings  which  cover  the 
legs  reveal  what  is  hidden  beneath  them,  so  the  part  of  the  water  which 
lies  on  the  surface  reveals  the  nature  of  its  base,  inasmuch  as  that  part 
of  the  water  which  bathes  its  base,  finding  there  certain  protrusions 
caused  by  the  stones,  strikes  upon  them  and  leaps  up  raising  with  it  all 
the  other  water  which  flows  above  it.  a  59  v. 

WHY  IF  IN  THE  LEVEL  BED  OF  A  STREAM  THERE  IS  A 

SOLITARY  ROCK  THE  WATER   BEYOND  IT 

FORMS  MANY  PROTUBERANCES 

The  reason  of  this  is  that  the  water  which  strikes  this  rock  afterwards 
descends  and  makes  a  kind  of  pit,  in  which  in  its  course  it  searches  for 
the  hollow  and  then  leaps  back  to  a  height  and  again  falls  down  to  the 
bottom  and  does  the  same,  so  continuing  many  times,  like  a  ball  that  is 
thrown  on  the  ground  which  before  it  finishes  its  course  makes  many 
bounds  each  smaller  than  the  one  before  it. 


WHAT  CAUSES  THE  EDDIES  OF  WATER 

All  the  movements  of  the  wind  resemble  those  of  the  water. 

Universally  all  things  desire  to  maintain  themselves  in  their  natural 
state.  So  moving  water  strives  to  maintain  the  course  pursuant  to  the 
power  which  occasions  it,  and  if  it  finds  an  obstacle  in  its  path  it  com- 
pletes the  span  of  the  course  it  has  commenced,  by  a  circular  and  revolv- 
ing movement. 

So  when  water  pours  out  of  a  narrow  channel  and  descends  with  fury 
into  the  slow-moving  currents  of  mighty  seas — since  in  the  greater  bulk 
there  is  greater  power,  and  greater  power  offers  resistance  to  the  lesser — 
in  this  case,  the  water  descending  upon  the  sea  beats  down  upon  its 
slow-moving  mass,  and  this  cannot  make  a  place  for  it  with  sufficient 
speed  because  it  is  held  up  by  the  rest  of  the  water;  and  so  the  water 
that  descends,  not  being  willing  to  slacken  its  course,  turns  round  after 
it  has  struck,  and  continues  its  first  movement  in  circling  eddies,  and  so 


THE  NATURE   OF   WATER  661 

fulfils  its  desire  down  in  the  depth;  for  in  these  same  eddies  it  finds 
nothing  more  than  its  own  movement,  which  is  attended  by  a  suc- 
cession of  circles  one  within  the  other;  and  by  thus  revolving  in  circles 
its  course  becomes  longer  and  more  continuous,  because  it  meets  with 
no  obstacle  except  itself;  and  this  motion  eats  away  and  consumes  the 
banks,  and  they  fall  headlong  in  ruin.  ...  a  60  r. 

THE  EDDIES  AT  THE  BOTTOM  OF  WATER  MOVE  IN  AN 
OPPOSITE  DIRECTION  TO  THOSE  ABOVE 

The  reason  of  this  is  that,  if  the  circles  which  above  are  large  become 
reduced  to  a  point  as  they  are  submerged,  and  then  continue  their 
movement  in  the  direction  in  which  it  began,  the  water  will  at  the 
bottom  make  a  movement  contrary  to  that  above  when  it  separates 
itself  from  its  centre. 

Although  the  sounds  which  traverse  the  air  proceed  from  their 
sources  by  circular  movements,  nevertheless  the  circles  which  are  pro- 
pelled by  their  different  motive  powers  meet  together  without  any 
hindrance  and  penetrate  and  pass  across  one  another,  keeping  always 
their  causes  as  their  centres. 

Since,  in  all  cases  of  movement,  water  has  great  conformity  with  air, 
I  will  offer  it  as  an  example  of  the  above-mentioned  proposition.  I  say 
that,  if  at  the  same  time  you  throw  two  small  stones  into  a  large  lake  of 
still  water  at  a  certain  distance  one  from  another,  you  will  observe  two 
distinct  sets  of  circles  form  round  the  two  points  where  they  have 
struck;  and  as  these  sets  of  circles  grow  larger  they  come  to  meet 
together  and  the  circles  intersect  one  with  another,  always  keeping  as 
their  centres  the  spots  which  were  struck  by  the  stones.  The  reason  of 
this  is  that  although  some  show  of  movement  may  be  visible  there,  the 
water  does  not  depart  from  its  place  because  the  openings  made  there 
by  the  stones  are  instantly  closed;  and  the  movement  occasioned  by  the 
sudden  opening  and  closing  of  the  water  makes  a  certain  shaking 
which  one  would  define  as  a  quivering  rather  than  a  movement.  That 
what  I  say  may  be  more  evident  to  you,  just  consider  those  pieces  of 
straw  which  on  account  of  their  lightness  float  on  the  surface  of  the 
water  and  are  not  moved  from  their  position  by  the  wave  that  rolls 
beneath  them  as  the  circles  widen.  This  disturbance  of  the  water,  there- 


662  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

fore,  being  a  quivering  rather  than  a  movement,  the  circles  cannot 
break  one  another  as  they  meet,  for,  as  all  the  parts  of  water  are  of  a 
like  substance,  it  follows  that  these  parts  transmit  the  quivering  from 
one  to  another  without  changing  their  place,  for,  as  the  water  remains 
in  its  position,  it  can  easily  take  this  quivering  from  the  parts  near  to  it 
and  pass  it  on  to  other  parts  near  to  it,  its  force  meanwhile  steadily 
decreasing  until  the  end.  a  6i  r. 

The  winding  courses  of  the  water  caused  by  the  rebounds  of  the 
percussions  which  they  make  against  the  banks  will  cause  the  bed  of  the 
river  below  them  to  be  more  hollowed  out  than  any  other  part;  and  in 
their  percussions  they  will  become  of  great  depth;  and  the  water  that  is 
whirled  round  near  to  these  deep  places  will  serve  to  undermine  and 
destroy  the  banks  against  which  it  strikes. 

One  both  clearly  sees  and  recognises  that  the  waters  which  strike  the 
banks  of  the  rivers  act  in  the  same  way  as  balls  which,  when  they  are 
struck  against  walls,  rebound  from  these  at  angles  similar  to  those  at 
which  they  strike,  and  proceed  to  strike  against  the  opposite  sides  of  the 
walls.  So  these  waters  after  having  first  struck  against  the  one  bank, 
leap  back  towards  the  opposite  one  and  strike  upon  it  and  hollow  it  out 
with  vigour,  because  there  is  a  greater  confluence  of  water  in  this  spot. 
The  reason  of  this  is  that  the  water  which  leaps  back  from  one  bank  to 
another  hollows  out  that  part  of  the  bed  of  the  river  which  finds  itself 
beneath  it;  and  the  other  water  of  the  river  which  cannot  be  received  in 
this  low  part  remains  repulsed  and  thrown  back  somewhat  by  the  direct 
course  of  the  river.  And  having  no  way  of  escape,  it  returns  to  its 
natural  course,  that  is,  that,  as  the  bed  of  the  river  finds  itself  lower 
under  the  winding  ways  made  by  the  above-mentioned  percussions  of 
the  waters,  this  second  water,  which  has  lost  its  adventitious  means  of 
escape,  resumes  its  natural  course,  falls  into  the  lower  parts  of  the  river 
and  strikes  the  banks  at  the  same  spot  as  that  which  witnessed  the  per- 
cussion of  the  aforesaid  rebounds.  As  this  bank  is  thus  assailed  by  two 
entirely  different  sets  of  percussions  a  larger  hollow  is  caused  in  it,  for, 
while  the  first  strike  the  bank  above,  the  others  descending  more 
steeply  devour  and  lay  it  bare  at  its  base,  and  this  is  the  cause  of  the 
aforesaid  destruction  and  subsidence  of  the  banks.  a  6$  v. 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  663 

OF  WATER 

No  part  of  the  watery  element  will  raise  itself  or  make  itself  more 
distant  from  the  common  centre  except  by  violence.  No  violence  is  last- 
ing, c  15  r. 

THE  LEAP  OF  WATER  IS  HIGHER  IN  A  BUCKET  THAN  IN 
A  GREAT  LAKE 

This  is  because  [confined]  water  when  struck  by  a  blow  cannot  make 
its  impetus  pass  from  circle  to  circle  as  it  would  in  a  great  lake;  and 
since  the  water  when  struck  finds  near  to  itself  the  edges  of  the  bucket, 
which  are  harder  and  more  resisting  than  the  other  water,  it  cannot 
expand  itself,  and  consequently  it  comes  about  that  the  whole  of  its 
impetus  is  turned  upwards;  and  therefore  water  struck  by  a  stone 
throws  its  drops  up  higher  when  its  waves  are  confined  than  when  they 
have  a  wide  space.  c  22  r. 

[Of  the  motion  of  water] 

Water  or  anything  falling  upon  water  causes  the  water  that  receives 
the  blow  to  spread  itself  out  beneath  the  blow  and  to  surround  it,  and 
having  passed  over  the  cause  of  this  blow  it  continues  above  it  in  pyra- 
midal shape  and  then  falls  back  to  the  common  level. 

The  reason  of  this  is  that  when  a  drop  of  water  falls  from  a  roof 
upon  other  water,  the  part  that  receives  the  blow  cannot  find  room  or 
escape  within  the  rest  of  the  water  with  the  speed  with  which  it  has 
been  attacked,  because  it  would  be  necessary  for  it  to  support  too  much 
weight  in  order  to  enter  under  so  great  a  quantity  of  water.  Having 
therefore  to  obey  its  own  course  as  well  as  the  action  of  that  which 
drives  it  from  its  place,  and  finding  that  as  the  adjacent  water  does  not 
receive  the  blow  and  is  not  ready  for  a  similar  flight  it  cannot  penetrate 
it,  it  seeks  instead  the  shortest  way  and  flows  through  the  substance 
that  offers  it  less  resistance,  namely  the  air. 

And  as  this  first  circle  that  surrounds  the  place  which  has  been  struck 
closes  up  with  fury,  because  it  was  raised  above  the  common  surface  of 
the  water,  it  reduces  the  water  that  escapes  upwards  to  the  form  of  a 
pyramid. 


664  THE  NATURE  OF   WATER 

And  if  you  think  that  the  water  which  falls  was  the  same  as  that 
which  leaps  up,  make  a  small  stone  drop  into  the  water  and  you  will 
see  the  water  leap  up  in  the  same  way  and  not  the  stone.  c  22  v. 

Every  part  of  water  within  other  water  that  is  without  movement 
lies  equally  at  rest  with  that  situated  at  the  same  level. 

Here  experience  shows  that  if  there  were  a  lake  of  very  great  size 
which  lay  without  movement  of  wind  either  entering  or  departing,  and 
if  you  were  to  remove  a  very  small  part  of  the  height  of  the  bank  which 
is  below  the  surface  of  the  water,  all  the  water  that  is  above  the  top  of 
the  bank  that  was  cut  away  will  pass  through  this  cutting,  but  will  not 
set  in  movement  or  draw  with  it  out  of  the  lake  any  part  of  the  water 
that  lay  there  before  this  water  moved  and  went  away. 

In  this  instance  nature  is  constrained  by  the  workings  of  its  law 
which  lives  infused  within  it,  namely,  that  all  the  parts  of  that  surface 
of  the  waters  which  are  supported  by  the  banks  without  any  opening  or 
exit  are  situated  at  an  equal  distance  from  the  centre  of  the  earth. 

c  23  v. 


HOW  IT  IS  POSSIBLE  FOR  LARGE  STONES  TO  BE  ROLLED 
OVER  BY  WATER 

Know  that  stones  are  rolled  over  by  water  because  this  water  either 
surrounds  or  flows  over  them.  If  it  surrounds  them  it  meets  again 
beyond  them  and  intersects,  hollowing  out  the  soil  or  sand  beyond  the 
stone,  and  this  after  being  thus  laid  bare  begins  to  roll  of  itself.  And  if 
the  water  flows  over  the  stone,  then  after  it  has  done  so  it  falls  in  the 
same  line,  and  by  the  force  of  its  impetus  penetrates  from  the  surface  to 
the  base  of  the  other  water,  and  gnaws  and  tugs  and  drags  away  the 
stone  from  the  opposing  obstacles  with  the  result  that  this  also  begins 
to  roll,  and  so  continues  from  place  to  place  until  it  traverses  the  whole 
river.  And  if  a  lesser  stone  should  stand  in  its  path  the  water  uncovers 
it  by  the  same  process  and  does  the  same,  and  in  this  way  stones  are 
rolled  over  in  the  beds  of  flowing  rivers.  c  24  v. 

A  horse  or  man  or  any  other  creature  that  makes  its  way  through 
stagnant  water  of  medium  depth  will  cause  this  water  to  rise  and  cover 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  665 

a  quantity  of  the  shore  towards  which  this  creature  is  directing  its 
course. 

This  may  be  clearly  demonstrated;  for  if  you  take  a  step  in  this  water 
you  will  find  that  it  makes  a  wave  which  directs  its  course  and  moves 
in  the  same  direction  as  that  in  which  the  creature  is  travelling;  nor 
does  it  pause  until  it  has  achieved  its  desire  and  covered  a  small  part  of 
the  shore. 

A  second  step  creates  another  wave  which  has  a  similar  result,  and 
the  same  with  the  third  and  all  the  steps;  each  of  itself  creating  a  wave 
that  travels  as  far  as  the  shore,  in  such  a  way  that  this  shore  which 
formerly  was  uncovered  finds  itself  covered  by  water  over  a  great  dis- 
tance— then  when  you  have  emerged  from  this  water  you  will  see  it 
returning  to  its  former  position  in  swift  course.  c  25  r. 

Waves  of  rivers  that  flow  against  the  courses  of  the  winds  will  be  of 
greater  height  than  others. 

The  rivers  that  move  against  the  courses  of  the  winds  will  have  a 
greater  current  below  than  above,  as  their  surface  on  being  driven  by 
the  winds  becomes  slower  than  it  was  at  first. 

The  reason  of  this  is  that  if  the  rivers,  being  of  equal  depth  and 
breadth,  are  of  uniform  current  at  the  bottom  and  on  the  surface,  the 
resistance  made  by  the  wind  to  the  current  on  the  surface  must  neces- 
sarily cause  it  to  turn  back,  and  as  it  does  not  suffice  these  waves  to 
raise  themselves  a  little,  falling  at  last  they  enter  underneath  the  others 
and  proceed  to  the  bottom.  Finding  there  the  other  current  of  the  bot- 
tom it  accompanies  it,  and  as  the  bank  is  not  capable  of  containing  this 
increase  it  is  necessary  that  at  the  bottom  the  current  doubles  itself;  if 
it  were  not  so  one  would  see  the  water  rising  far  above  the  banks  of  the 
rivers.  c  25  v. 

The  stone  placed  in  the  level  and  smooth  beds  of  flowing  rivers 
becomes  the  cause  of  their  inequality  and  deterioration. 

When  an  object  which  is  dropping  down  strikes  upon  another  object 
harder  than  itself  it  suddenly  makes  a  rebound  which  is  so  much 
greater  as  it  has  had  a  greater  fall.  When  therefore  a  stone  is  situated 
beneath  the  surface  of  running  rivers,  the  greater  its  size  the  greater  is 
the  percussion  that  takes  place  when  water  falls  from  its  summit  upon 


666  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

the  beds  of  the  rivers,  and  on  account  of  this  it  comes  to  produce  a 
deeper  hollow  in  the  place  struck  by  this  water. 

After  this  first  percussion  many  rebounds  will  follow,  and  these  will 
become  larger  in  size  and  less  powerful  as  they  are  farther  removed 
from  the  first. 

The  embankment  which  sends  forth  the  trunk  of  the  tree  that  it  has 
nourished,  to  project  into  the  waves  of  the  rapid  rivers,  will  become  the 
cause  of  the  destruction  of  the  opposite  bank. 

The  cause  of  this  effect  is  that  the  water  that  flows  in  the  rivers 
always  goes  leaping  from  bank  to  bank.  If  nothing  projects  in  this  bank 
many  lines  of  water  gather  there  and  unite  together  and  leap  in  a  mass 
on  the  opposite  bank,  and  twist  themselves  in  with  the  other  lines 
which  they  meet  with  on  their  way;  and  having  reached  the  embank- 
ment they  gnaw  and  destroy  it.  And  there  are  yet  new  lines  produced 
there  which  leap  back  and  damage  the  other  bank;  and  so  from  place 
to  place  they  begin  to  form  eddies  of  varying  depths,  and  hence  it 
comes  about  that  straight  rivers  become  winding  and  crooked. 

c  26  r. 

WHAT  WATER  IS 

Of  the  four  elements  water  is  the  second  least  heavy  and  the  second 
in  respect  of  mobility.  It  is  never  at  rest  until  it  unites  with  its  maritime 
element,  where,  when  not  disturbed  by  the  winds,  it  establishes  itself 
and  remains  with  its  surface  equidistant  from  the  centre  of  the  world. 
It  is  the  increase  and  humour  of  all  vital  bodies.  Without  it  nothing 
retains  its  first  form.  It  unites  and  augments  bodies  by  its  increase. 

Nothing  lighter  than  itself  can  penetrate  it  without  violence. 

It  readily  raises  itself  by  heat  in  thin  vapour  through  the  air.  Cold 
causes  it  to  freeze.  Stagnation  make  it  foul.  That  is,  heat  sets  it  in  move- 
ment, cold  causes  it  to  freeze,  immobility  corrupts  it. 

It  assumes  every  odour,  colour  and  flavour,  and  of  itself  it  has  noth- 
ing. It  percolates  through  all  porous  bodies.  Against  its  fury  no 
human  defence  avails,  or  if  it  should  avail  it  is  not  for  long.  In  its  rapid 
course  it  often  serves  as  a  support  to  things  heavier  than  itself.  It  can  lift 
itself  up  by  movement  or  bound  as  far  as  it  sinks  down.  It  submerges 
with  itself  in  headlong  course  things  lighter  than  itself.  The  mastery 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  667 

of  its  course  is  sometimes  on  the  surface,  sometimes  in  the  centre, 
sometimes  at  the  bottom.  One  portion  rises  over  the  transverse  course 
of  another,  and  but  for  this  the  surfaces  of  the  running  waters  would 
be  without  undulations.  Every  small  obstacle  whether  on  its  bank  or  in 
its  bed  will  be  the  cause  of  the  falling  away  of  the  bank  or  bed  opposite 
to  it.  When  the  water  is  low  it  does  more  damage  to  the  bank  in  its 
course  than  it  does  when  it  flows  in  full  stream.  Its  parts  do  not  weigh 
upon  the  parts  placed  beneath  them.  No  river  will  ever  keep  its  course 
in  the  same  direction  between  its  banks.  Its  upper  parts  do  not  impart 
weight  to  the  lower. 

[An  experiment] 

WATER  AND  AIR 

I  wish  to  show  you  in  what  manner  water  can  be  supported  by  air 
while  being  divided  and  separated  from  it.  Certainly  if  you  have  reason 
in  you,  I  believe  that  you  will  not  deny  that  if  there  be  a  leather  bag 
placed  at  the  bottom  of  the  water  in  a  well,  so  as  to  touch  all  its  sides, 
in  such  a  way  that  the  water  cannot  pass  beneath,  if  this  leather  bag  be 
filled  with  air  it  will  not  exert  less  force  in  rising  to  the  surface  of  the 
water  to  find  the  other  air  than  the  water  makes  in  its  desire  to  touch 
the  bottom  of  the  well.  And  if  this  leather  bag  desires  to  rise  up  it  will 
push  up  the  water  that  is  placed  above  it,  and  by  raising  this  water  it 
will  take  its  weight  from  ofT  the  bottom  of  the  well.  For  this  reason 
therefore  it  is  almost  as  though  the  well  were  bottomless. 

Where  and  why  the  movement  of  the  water  ought  to  hollow  out  the 
sand  of  the  surface  of  the  beds  of  flowing  rivers — but  to  speak  first  of 
the  percussion  on  the  surface: 

The  more  rapid  the  current  of  the  water  along  the  slope  of  a  smooth 
canal  the  more  powerful  will  be  its  percussion  against  whatever  opposes 
it. 

For  all  the  elements  when  removed  from  their  natural  position  desire 
to  return  to  it,  especially  fire,  water  and  earth;  and  the  shorter  the  line 
along  which  this  return  is  made,  the  straighter  its  course,  and  the 
straighter  its  course  the  greater  the  percussion  upon  whatever  opposes 


668  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

The  same  effect  is  produced  by  the  wind  blowing  through  streets 
of  uniform  width.  c  26  v. 


THE  ORDER  OF  THE  FIRST  BOOK  ON  WATER 

Define  first  of  all  what  is  height  and  depth,  also  how  the  elements  are 
situated  one  within  the  other.  Then  what  is  solid  weight  and  liquid 
weight;  but  first  of  all  what  weight  and  lightness  consist  of  in  them- 
selves. Then  describe  why  water  moves,  and  why  its  motion  ceases; 
then  why  it  becomes  slower  or  more  rapid,  and  in  addition  to  this  how 
it  continually  descends  when  in  contact  with  air  that  is  lower  than 
itself;  and  how  the  water  rises  in  the  air  through  the  heat  of  the  sun 
and  then  falls  back  in  rain.  Further,  why  the  water  springs  from  the 
summits  of  the  mountains,  and  whether  any  spring  of  water  higher 
than  the  ocean  can  pour  forth  water  higher  than  the  surface  of  this 
ocean;  and  how  all  the  water  that  returns  to  the  ocean  is  higher  than 
the  sphere  of  the  water:  and  how  the  water  of  the  equinoctial  seas  is 
higher  than  the  northern  waters,  and  is  higher  beneath  the  body  of  the 
sun  than  in  any  other  part  of  the  circle  of  the  equator;  for  when  the 
experiment  is  made  under  the  heat  of  a  burning  brand,  the  water  boils 
as  the  effect  of  the  brand,  and  the  water  around  the  centre  of  where 
it  boils  descends  in  a  circular  wave.  And  how  the  waters  of  the  north 
are  lower  than  the  other  seas,  and  more  so  as  they  become  colder,  until 
they  are  changed  into  ice.  e  12  r. 

[Rivers] 

That  river  which  stretches  itself  out  most  by  long  tortuous  windings 
is  the  one  which  becomes  filled  up  most  rapidly  with  matter.  This  is 
proved  by  the  twelfth,  which  says: — the  water  that  loiters  most  dis- 
charges most  rapidly  the  matter  that  it  carries.  Therefore  the  river 
which  by  meandering  more  makes  itself  longer  by  means  of  its  twists 
and  turns  makes  itself  so  much  slower  in  proportion  as  it  makes  itself 
longer.  e  66  v. 

Of  the  difference  that  exists  between  the  accidents  of  water  and 
the  accidents  of  air  and  fire: 

Water  is  not  capable  in  itself  of  being  either  condensed  or  rarefied, 
but  it  exists  in  as  great  quantity  in  front  of  the  fish  that  penetrates  it  as 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  669 

behind  it,  and  it  opens  itself  up  as  much  in  front  of  that  which  pene- 
trates it  as  it  closes  up  behind  this  penetrating  thing.  And  the  impetus 
of  the  fish  is  of  briefer  duration  than  that  of  the  bird  in  the  air, 
although  the  muscles  of  the  bird  are  very  powerful  in  relation  to  their 
quantity;  because  the  fish  is  all  muscle  and  this  is  very  necessary 
because  it  is  in  a  heavier  substance  than  the  air.  But  although  the  water 
is  not  itself  capable  of  being  condensed  it  is  of  a  nature  to  acquire 
gravity  and  levity.  It  acquires  gravity  at  the  destruction  of  the  impetus 
which  raises  it  in  the  air  at  the  creation  of  the  wave,  and  levity  by  the 
creation  of  the  impetus  that  lightens  the  water  and  causes  it  to  move 
contrary  to  the  natural  course  of  heavy  things. 


OF  THE  VALLEY  INTERPOSED  BETWEEN  THE  WAVES 

The  valley  interposed  between  the  waves  is  lower  than  the  general 
surface  of  the  water,  as  one  sees  when  the  water  turns  back  in  order  to 
fill  up  the  places  that  have  been  struck  by  the  water-spouts.

OF  SURFACE  EDDIES  AND  THOSE  FORMED  AT  VARIOUS 
HEIGHTS  OF  THE  WATER 

Of  those  that  take  up  the  whole  of  this  height  and  of  the  moving  and 
the  fixed.  Of  the  long  and  the  round.  Of  those  that  change  their  move- 
ment and  those  that  divide,  and  those  that  become  merged  in  those 
[eddies]  to  which  they  unite  themselves,  and  those  that  are  mingled 
with  the  falling  and  reflex  water  and  make  it  spin  around. 

Which  are  the  eddies  that  cause  light  things  to  whirl  round  on  the 
surface  and  do  not  submerge  them?  Which  are  those  that  submerge 
them  and  cause  them  to  spin  round  upon  the  bottom  and  then  deposit 
them  upon  this  bottom  ?  Which  are  those  that  separate  the  things  from 
the  bottom  and  throw  them  back  to  the  surface  of  the  water?  Which 
are  the  slanting  eddies,  which  are  the  straight,  which  are  the  shallow?

670  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

PLAN  OF  THE  TREATISE  ON  WATER.  SWIMMING 

When  you  put  together  the  science  of  the  movements  of  water 
remember  to  put  beneath  each  proposition  its  applications,  so  that  such 
science  may  not  be  without  its  uses. 

Of  the  usefulness  of  the  courses  that  the  swimmer  ought  to  follow 
with  regard  to  the  surface  revolutions  of  the  waters  and  as  to  their 
eddies  which  submerge  these  swimmers.  Then  how  he  ought  to  direct 
himself  when  submerged  in  order  to  save  himself,  and  so  forth. 

And  at  the  end  of  each  book  notice  the  things  that  are  most  remark- 
able, as  how  to  break  through  the  thickness  of  the  eddies  in  any  direc- 
tion. Of  what  measures  one  ought  to  take  when  swimming  in  a 
rough  sea,  and  how  to  avoid  being  dashed  against  the  rocks  and  on  the 
rudders  of  ships.  f  2  v. 

Of  the  things  carried  by  the  water,  that  will  make  the  greatest 
revolution  which  is  of  least  size : 

This  happens  because  the  great  revolutions  of  eddies  are  infrequent 
in  the  currents  of  rivers  and  the  small  eddies  are  almost  numberless, 
and  large  objects  are  only  turned  round  by  large  eddies  and  not  by 
small  ones,  whereas  small  objects  revolve  both  in  small  eddies  and 
large. 

Of  objects  equal  in  length  and  breadth  carried  by  the  current  of  the 
waters,  those  will  make  fewest  revolutions  which  are  deepest. 

This  happens  because  these  revolutions  vary  greatly  from  the  surface 
to  the  bottom  of  the  water,  in  which  as  many  revolutions  are  produced 
as  there  is  depth  to  cause  them.  Wherefore  of  necessity  an  object  borne 
by  the  water  when  it  buries  itself  deeply  is  buffeted  by  many  revolu- 
tions at  different  degrees  of  altitude;  and  for  this  reason  it  remains  in 
a  state  of  hesitance  and  many  times  obeys  none  or  if  it  obeys  then  it 
obeys  the  most  powerful. 

Of  objects  equal  in  shape  and  size,  that  which  is  buried  deepest  will 
obey  least  the  revolutions  of  the  water.  f  3  r.

holes,  high  or  low,  wide  or  narrow;  and  the  walls  thick  or  thin.

Book  nine.  Of  the  water  that  passes  through  a  reservoir,  of  which 
the  walls  are  full  of  holes  of  various  sizes,  shapes  and  positions,  at  dif- 
ferent heights,  varying  from  the  entrance  to  the  exit  and  conversely; 
and  so  also  the  reservoir  of  different  shapes,  depths,  lengths,  and 
breadths;  and  the  water  more  or  less  powerful  and  swift,  great  and 
small.  f  5  r. 

The  flow  and  ebb  is  double  in  the  same  sheet  of  water,  because  it 
will  be  many  times  at  the  mouth  of  this  sheet  of  water  before  there  is 
a  decrease  in  the  great  sheet  of  water;  this  occurs  because  the  wave  of 
the  first  flow  runs  strongly  in  the  sheet  of  water,  and  during  the  time 
when  this  wave  follows  its  impetus  that  at  the  mouth  makes  its  ebb. 
Before  the  wave,  penetrating  into  the  neck,  feels  the  ebb  at  this  mouth 
of  the  sheet  of  water  g  a,  the  flow  starts  again  at  this  mouth,  and  in  this 
time  the  wave,  which  has  penetrated  into  the  neck,  pauses,  slackening 
its  impetus  in  proportion  as  the  second  penetration  by  the  second  wave 
begins  afresh.  Thus  so  many  of  these  waves  enter  the  neck  that  the 
sheet  of  water  is  raised  and  its  waters  come  back  with  impetus  behind 
the  ebb  that  recedes  from  this  mouth,  and  [this  ebb]  does  not  pene- 
trate farther  in  the  third  or  fourth  wave,  so  that  the  first  water  is  not 
thrust  out  of  the  entrance.  f  6  v. 

In  the  big  wide  eddies,  the  water  raises  and  uncovers  the  soil  heaped 
up  in  its  centre. 

In  the  small  eddies  of  water,  the  water  bores  down  and  makes  a 
hollow  in  the  centre  of  the  eddy. 

Of  objects  borne  by  the  water  upon  its  bed,  the  lighter  makes  a 
longer  path  in  the  same  time. 

A  river  does  not  remain  uniform,  for  after  the  current  it  unloads 
shingle,  and  after  this  it  produces  another  current,  of  which  the  move- 
ment is  directed  either  to  the  bank  or  the  centre  or  to  as  many  different 
spots  as  there  are  different  slopes  of  the  mounds  of  shingle  left  at  the 
bottom  by  the  aforesaid  currents.  f  7  r. 

The  depth  of  the  sheet  of  water  which  receives  the  fall  of  the  water 


6j2  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

will  always  have  the  shape  of  a  quarter  of  a  hollow  sphere,  if  the  soil  be 
of  uniform  resistance. 

And  this  arises  out  of  what  has  gone  before,  where  it  is  stated  that  the 
straight  course  of  the  water  is  higher  and  swifter  in  the  middle  than  on 
the  sides;  and  the  greater  speed  sends  its  fall  more  forward  than  does 
the  slower  speed.  ...  f  7  v. 

Given  the  depth  of  the  fall  of  the  water  and  its  slant,  with  the  power 
of  the  wheel  that  is  its  object,  one  seeks  the  height  of  the  fall  of  this 
water  in  order  to  make  itself  equal  to  the  power  of  the  wheel. 

The  water  that  strikes  upon  the  objects  sometimes  leaps  up  con- 
siderably, sometimes  only  a  little,  and  sometimes  it  descends,  and  this 
arises  from  the  objects  being  small  or  large,  or  the  descent  in  front  of 
these  objects  being  greater  or  less,  or  from  the  current  that  strikes  these 
objects  being  more  or  less  powerful.  f  8  v. 


WATER— QUESTIONS 

Why  the  eddies  of  the  water  are  hollowed  in  the  centre  by  their 
revolution. 

Why  the  impressions  produced  on  the  surface  of  the  water  will  main- 
tain themselves  for  some  time,  on  being  carried  by  the  course  of  the 
waters. 

Why  the  movements  of  the  impressions  of  the  waters  penetrate  each 
other  without  change  of  their  first  shape. 

Rule  as  to  the  measurements  of  water  and  what  breadth,  depth,  and 
rapidity  of  movement  a  given  space  of  current  ought  to  have  in  a  given 
time. 

Given  the  resistance  of  a  wheel  and  given  the  slant  and  descent  in 
the  fall  of  the  water,  one  asks  how  great  must  its  volume  be  to  be 
equal  to  the  said  resistance. 

Given  the  volume  of  the  fall  of  the  water  and  its  length  and  slant, 
one  asks  whether  the  power  of  the  wheel  is  equal  to  this  power  of  the 
water. 

Given  the  resistance  of  the  wheel  and  the  slant  of  the  water  and  its 
volume,  one  asks  the  length  of  the  fall.  f  9  r.

THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  673 

OF  THE  MEASURING  OF  WATER  AND  IN  HOW  MANY 
WAYS  IT  CAN  VARY 

Water  that  pours  out  through  the  same-sized  mouth  may  vary  in 
extent  in  a  greater  or  less  degree  in  [various]  ways,  of  which  the  first  is 
that  the  surface  of  the  water  may  be  either  a  greater  or  less  distance 
above  the  mouth  through  which  it  pours,  the  second  that  the  water 
passes  with  greater  or  less  speed  beyond  the  bank  where  this  mouth  is 
made,  the  third  that  the  side  below  the  thickness  of  the  mouth  where 
the  water  passes  may  be  either  more  or  less  slanting,  the  fourth  in  the 
variety  of  slant  of  the  sides  of  this  mouth,  fifth  in  the  thickness  of  the 
lip  of  this  mouth,  sixth  as  to  the  shape  of  the  mouth,  that  is  whether  it 
be  round  or  square,  or  rectangular  or  elongated,  seventh  according  as 
this  mouth  is  placed  at  a  greater  or  less  slant  of  bank  in  its  length, 
eighth  as  this  mouth  is  placed  in  a  greater  or  less  slant  of  bank  in  its 
height,  ninth  according  as  it  is  situated  in  the  concave  or  convex  parts 
of  the  bank,  tenth  as  it  may  be  placed  towards  the  greater  or  less  width 
of  the  canal,  eleventh  if  the  top  of  the  canal  has  more  speed  at  the  top 
of  the  mouth  or  more  slowness  than  elsewhere,  twelfth  if  the  bed  have 
round  bosses  and  hollows  opposite  to  this  mouth  or  higher  or  lower, 
thirteenth  according  to  whether  the  water  that  passes  through  this 
mouth  takes  the  wind  or  not,  fourteenth  if  the  water  that  falls  out  of 
this  mouth  falls  through  the  air  shut  in  on  one  side  or  on  all  except  the 
front,  fifteenth  as  the  water  that  falls  thus  enclosed  is  deep  within  its 
vessel  or  shallow,  sixteenth  whether  the  enclosed  water  which  falls 
makes  a  long  fall  or  a  short  one;  seventeenth  whether  the  sides  of  the 
canal  where  this  water  descends  are  hollow  or  protuberant  or  straight 
or  curving.  f  9  v. 

Of  the  eddies  of  water  which  frequently  turn  their  revolving  move- 
ment backwards : 

Of  the  falling  and  the  reflex  eddies.  The  eddy  sometimes  grows  in 
power  and  diminishes  in  diameter,  and  sometimes  diminishes  in 
strength  and  increases  in  diameter. 

The  first  movement  is  when  the  water  flows  away  by  its  base,  as  the 
water  that  forms  the  eddy  becomes  swifter  when  it  is  lower,  because 
it  has  a  greater  weight  of  water  above  it  and  therefore  becomes  swifter; 


674  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

and  because  the  water  pushes  downwards  more  than  upwards  it 
restricts  this  void  in  the  eddy  more  and  more;  and  it  bends  because  it 
directs  itself  to  whether  the  sheet  of  water  has  its  outlet.  f  12  r. 

Water  with  an  uneven  bed  makes  contrary  movements  from  the  sur- 
face to  the  bed.  The  unevenness  in  the  beds  of  rivers  springs  from  the 
bends  in  the  banks  or  from  substances  that  have  fallen  from  these  banks 
to  their  feet.  f  12  v. 

OF  THE  ACCIDENTAL  EDDY 

When  the  hand  is  turned  in  circular  movement  in  a  vase  half-filled 
with  water  it  causes  an  accidental  eddy  which  will  expose  the  bottom  of 
this  vase  to  the  air,  and  when  its  motive  power  is  at  rest  this  eddy  will 
follow  the  same  movement  but  it  will  diminish  continually  until  the- 
end  of  the  impetus  imparted  to  it  by  its  motive  power.  f  13  r. 

OF  THE  HOLLOW  AND  UTILITY  OF  EDDIES  OF  WATER 

The  eddy  with  the  deeper  hollow  will  be  that  produced  in  water  of 
swifter  movement. 

And  that  eddy  will  have  a  smaller  hollow  if  it  is  produced  in  deeper 
water  which  has  not  the  same  movement  but  is  slower. 

And  with  water  of  equal  speed  that  will  keep  a  larger  hollow  where 
a  greater  depth  of  water  turns  with  its  movement. 

This  is  said  because  many  times  the  eddies  are  produced  in  a  straight 
current  in  a  great  expanse  of  slowly  moving  water;  and  as  this  water  is 
partly  supported  by  the  eddy  which  revolves  in  a  thin  coil  between  it 
and  the  air  of  the  hollow,  this  lateral  water  being  of  great  weight 
pushes  upon  the  sides  of  the  eddy  where  it  is  leaning  and  finding  them 
weak  compresses  them.  f  13  v. 

[Of  eddies] 

If  water  higher  than  air  acquires  weight,  as  is  shown  in  the  seventh 
of  the  ninth,  why  is  it  that  the  water  of  the  sides  of  the  eddies  is  higher 
than  the  bottom  of  the  eddy  which  up  to  this  point  is  full  of  air. 

You  have  the  fourth  of  the  seventh  which  proves  that  every  heavy 
substance  is  only  of  weight  along  the  line  of  its  movement  and  in  no 
other  direction;  and  here  you  see  very  deep  eddies  after  the  manner  of 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  675 

great  pits  in  rivers,  the  sides  of  which  are  of  water,  which  is  every- 
where higher  than  the  air  of  this  eddy;  and  these  banks  of  water  are 
without  weight  except  by  this  line  of  their  movement,  during  the  time 
in  which  they  possess  the  strength  given  them  by  their  motive  power. 

What  produces  eddies  and  why  some  are  hollow  at  the  centre  and 
others  are  not. 

Whether  water  poured  into  the  hollow  of  eddies  would  fill  them 
or  no,  or  would  escape  by  the  bottom  and  enter  into  the  current  at  the 
side. 

Which  natural  eddies  are  of  considerable  depth  and  which  of  slight 
depth;  which  change  their  position  and  which  do  not  move;  which 
while  moving  turn  in  an  opposite  direction  and  which  keep  their  move- 
ment in  one  direction;  which  become  duplicated  and  which  do  not; 
which  unite  in  contrary  movements.  f  14  v. 

OF  WATERFALLS 

Write  first  of  the  simple  hollows  made  by  the  simple  falls  of  water 
upon  a  bed  of  a  uniform  substance,  and  then  upon  a  bed  of  various 
substances.  Then  with  obstacles  placed  in  the  course  that  the  water  takes 
in  its  descent,  then  with  obstacles  in  the  place  where  it  has  struck,  that 
is,  upon  its  bed;  then  in  its  reflex  movement,  and  first  at  the  beginning 
of  its  fall.  Then  describe  in  what  part  of  the  edge  of  the  sheet  of  water 
this  water  will  take  its  course;  and  what  substances  will  be  carried  away 
or  deposited  in  different  parts  of  the  bed  of  this  sheet  of  water;  and 
what  will  be  the  speed  or  slowness  of  movement  of  the  water  in  various 
parts  of  the  surface,  and  so  also  from  the  surface  to  the  bottom  at 
various  depths  and  breadths;  and  thus  you  will  do  as  far  as  the  bottom. 

f  15  v. 
[Movements  of  water] 

Of  the  parts  of  the  same  water  that  rises  through  the  air  at  different 
angles,  that  which  has  least  slant  falls  back  nearer  to  where  it  started. 

The  rising  motions  of  the  water  which  it  makes  from  the  bottom  to 
the  surface  of  the  sheet  of  water  will  never  fall  back  towards  the  bot-

cannot  penetrate  to  the  bottom,  by  the  seventh  of  the  ninth.

of  speed,  and  this  is  caused  by  the  air  that  it  penetrates  and  the  air  that 
is  mingled  with  it.  f  16  v. 

OF  THE  EDDIES  OF  WATER 

It  is  possible  for  there  to  be  less  depth  underneath  the  current  than 
before  it  or  on  the  sides. 

Let  o  c  n  be  the  current  and  a  an  eddy  of  double  strength  according 
to  the  ninth  concerning  eddies.  Since  in  addition  to  its  revolution  it 
strikes  against  the  bank  and  leaps  up  into  the  air,  and  falling  back  upon 
the  rest  of  the  water  penetrates  it  and  strikes  and  hollows  out  the  bed  in 
sudden  chasm,  for,  in  addition  to  the  force  of  the  blow,  there  is  joined 
the  spiral  drilling  made  by  the  aforesaid  revolution,  by  means  of  which 
what  has  been  shaken  by  the  blow  is  stirred  up  and  carried  away;  and 
it  becomes  more  powerful  as  it  is  more  turbid. 

And  this  is  the  most  powerful  method  that  can  be  made  use  of  in 
order  to  dislodge  and  carry  away  the  soil  and  so  create  a  great  chasm. 

Beneath  the  current  the  bed  will  become  raised  when  the  course  of 
this  current  dies  in  stagnant  water. 

By  the  sixth  of  the  ninth — where  the  course  of  the  water  fails,  there 
remains  that  which  the  water  has  brought.  f  17  v. 

Of  a  volume  of  water  that  has  struck  upon  an  object,  the  lower  part 
is  the  first  to  strike  the  bottom  and  it  is  instantly  reflected  to  the 
surface.  That  which  is  in  the  middle  does  not  descend  to  the  bottom, 
but  encountering  the  first  part  reflected  it  strikes  upon  it,  and  is 
knocked  and  so  it  also  is  bent  back  in  the  same  lines  and  revolutions. 

And  the  two  bodies  of  water  when  the  lower  encounters  the  higher 
unite  and  revolve  together  at  their  contact. 

Of  the  water  that  falls  into  other  water  that  which  is  nearest  the 
centre  of  the  fall  slants  most  and  that  nearest  the  extremities  is  the 
straightest.  f  18  v. 

SURFACE  WAVES 

When  water  strikes  other  water  at  a  considerable  angle  the  part 
which  strikes  first  is  immediately  bent  back  and  delays,  and  that  which 
succeeds  to  it  veils  it  with  a  thin  covering  and  runs  swiftly  upon  that 
which  first  slackens  and  so  it  is  then  bent  and  slackens  at  the  same 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  677 

bpot  as  the  foregoing.  And  the  water  that  follows  does  the  same  upon 
it,  and  so  in  succession  each  new  wave  follows  its  course. 

The  turbid  running  water,  if  it  is  high  at  its  start  and  at  its  entry 
into  the  sheet  of  water,  flows  for  a  considerable  distance  at  the  height 
of  its  first  impetus  before  it  buries  itself  or  becomes  mingled  with  the 
other  water.  f  19  v. 

Definition  of  the  half-cylindrical  wave  and  what  part  of  its  volume 
has  a  greater  or  less  slant,  and  how  it  commences  and  ends,  and  where 
it  is  more  or  less  wide  or  more  or  less  high  or  I  would  say  deep;  and  the 
differences  that  there  are  in  it  when  it  is  large  or  small  or  swift  or  slow. 

The  waters  flow  one  above  another  without  mingling  for  a  long 
space,  when  their  entrance  in  the  sheet  of  water  is  higher  and  swifter 
in  the  one  case  than  in  the  other.  f  20  r. 

Where  the  water  has  only  slight  movement  the  half-cylindrical  waves 
will  keep  their  direction  when  they  intersect. 

Where  it  is  swifter  they  will  curve. 

And  where  the  rates  of  speed  are  unequal  their  curves  will  vary 
towards  the  end.  f  20  v. 

Of  the  eddies  one  is  slower  at  the  centre  than  on  the  sides,  another 
is  swifter  at  the  centre  than  on  the  sides;  others  there  are  which  turn 
back  in  the  opposite  direction  to  their  first  movement. 

That  eddy  is  slower  at  the  centre  than  on  the  sides  which  makes  a 
great  revolution,  and  this  deposits  a  considerable  quantity  of  matter  in 
the  centre  of  its  circle  and  leaves  it  in  the  form  of  a  mound. 

The  eddy  which  is  swift  at  the  centre  of  its  revolution  carries  air  and 
water  in  its  base,  which  it  hollows  out  and  bores  down  after  the  fash- 
ion of  a  well.  f  21  r. 

Every  impression  of  the  water  is  maintained  over  a  long  space  and 
this  is  so  much  the  longer  as  it  is  swifter.

[Of  the  waves] 

In  proportion  as  the  waves  of  the  sea  are  higher  than  the  ordinary 
height  of  the  surface  of  its  water,  so  the  bottoms  of  the  valleys  that  lie 
between  the  waves  are  lower;  and  this  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  great 
fall  of  the  great  waves  creates  the  great  hollows  of  the  valleys.

680  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

OF  THE  ELEMENT  OF  WATER 

Here  follows  the  proof  of  what  is  said  on  the  opposite  page: 

I  say  that  no  part  of  the  surface  of  water  moves  of  itself  unless  it 
descends,  therefore  as  the  sphere  of  water  has  not  the  power  to  descend 
in  any  part  of  its  surface,  it  follows  from  the  first  conception  that  it 
does  not  move  of  itself.  And  if  you  carefully  consider  each  minute 
particle  of  this  surface  you  will  find  it  surrounded  by  other  similar 
particles  which  are  at  an  equal  distance  between  them  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  and  at  the  same  distance  from  this  centre  is  that  particle 
which  is  surrounded  by  them;  therefore,  by  the  third  conception,  that 
particle  of  the  water  will  not  move  of  itself  because  it  is  surrounded  by 
edges  of  equal  height.  And  thus  every  circle  formed  of  such  particles 
makes  itself  a  vessel  for  the  particles  enclosed  within  this  circle,  which 
vessel  has  the  circle  formed  by  its  edges  of  equal  height;  and  in  this 
respect  this  particle  resembles  all  the  other  similar  ones  of  which  the 
surface  of  the  sphere  of  the  water  is  composed.  Of  necessity  it  will  be 
without  movement  of  itself,  and  in  consequence  each  being  at  equal 
height  from  the  centre  of  the  world,  necessity  makes  their  surface 
spherical,  but  it  is  not  necessary  that  they  should  be  spherical  below,  as 
reason  and  experience  show. 

That  which  is  said  of  the  surface  of  the  water  that  borders  on  the  air 
is  understood  to  be  said  of  the  surface  of  the  air  that  borders  on  the 
fire,  which  would  be  such  as  often  to  evaporate  after  the  manner  of 
clouds  drawn  by  the  heat  of  the  sun,  as  does  the  water  drawn  through 
the  air  by  the  same  heat  in  the  form  of  clouds;  and  in  the  same  way 
the  fire  drawn  by  a  greater  heat  than  its  own,  that  is  to  say  by  the  sun, 
it  being  proved  in  the  sixth  that  it  is  warm  by  essence  and  not  by 
virtue,  as  many  would  have  it. 

So  having  proved  by  the  testimony  of  these  spheres  that  the  flexible 
elements  are  spherical,  it  is  my  purpose  to  investigate  nature  both  in  its 
universal  aspect  and  in  the  particulars  of  each  of  its  elements,  and  first 
of  fire,  then  of  air,  and  then  of  water.  f  26  v.

It  runs  bubbling  to  the  surface  of  this  water  by  different  ways  and 


THE   NATURE   OF   WATER  681 

according  to  the  movements  that  the  water  makes  when  struck  by  the 
penetration  of  the  fire.  By  means  of  this  experiment  you  can  investigate 
the  hot  vapours  which  are  exhaled  from  the  earth  and  pass  through  the 
water,  twisting  themselves  about  because  the  water  checks  their  move- 
ment, vapours  which  afterwards  penetrate  through  the  air  in  straighter 
movements. 

And  this  experiment  you  will  make  with  a  square  glass  vessel,  keep- 
ing your  eye  at  about  the  centre  of  one  of  these  walls;  and  in  the 
boiling  water  with  slow  movement  you  may  drop  a  few  grains  of 
panic-grass  because  by  means  of  the  movement  of  these  grains  you  can 
quickly  know  the  movement  of  the  water  that  carries  them  with  it. 
And  from  this  experiment  you  will  be  able  to  proceed  to  investigate 
many  beautiful  movements  which  result  from  one  element  penetrating 
into  another.  f  34  v. 

BOOK  FORTY-TWO.  OF  RAIN 

The  water  that  falls  from  the  cloud  is  sometimes  dissolved  into  such 
minute  particles  that  by  reason  of  the  friction  that  it  has  with  the  air  it 
cannot  divide  the  air  but  seems  to  change  itself  into  air.  Sometimes  in 
descending  it  multiplies,  because  it  finds  the  minutest  particles  of  water 
which  by  reason  of  their  lightness  were  of  slow  descent,  and  becomes 
incorporated  with  them,  and  at  every  stage  of  its  descent  acquires  a  new 
quantity  of  water.  Sometimes  the  winds  bend  the  rain  and  so  cause  its 
descent  to  be  slanting,  and  for  this  reason  the  descent  becomes  slow  and 
protracted,  and  it  frequently  happens  that  it  is  converted  into  such  fine 
particles  that  it  can  no  longer  descend  and  so  remains  in  the  air. 

[Treatise  on  water] 

Write  how  the  clouds  are  formed  and  how  they  dissolve,  and  what 
it  is  that  causes  vapour  to  rise  from  the  water  of  the  earth  into  the  air, 
and  the  cause  of  mists  and  of  the  air  becoming  thickened,  and  why  it 
appears  more  blue  or  less  blue  at  one  time  than  at  another.  Write  in 
the  same  way  of  the  regions  of  the  air  and  the  cause  of  snow  and  hail,

the  new  shapes  that  the  snow  forms  in  the  air,  and  of  the  trees  in  cold 
countries  with  the  new  shapes  of  the  leaves,  and  of  the  pinnacles  of  ice 
and  hoar-frost  that  form  new  shapes  of  plants  with  strange  leaves,  the

hoar-frost  serving  almost  as  the  dew  ready  to  nourish  and  sustain  the 
said  leaves.  f  35  r. 

No  surface  of  water  that  borders  upon  the  air  will  ever  be  lower  than 
that  of  the  sea. 

The  wave  that  the  motive  power  makes  before  it  in  the  air  or  be- 
tween the  surface  and  the  bed  of  the  water  is  in  the  shape  of  a  half 
sphere. 

The  wave  made  by  the  motive  power  on  the  surface  of  the  water  is 
in  the  shape  of  a  half-circle,  and  towards  the  bottom  it  has  the  shape 
of  a  quarter-circle. 

Why  the  movement  made  by  the  motive  power  on  the  surface  of  the 
water  makes  a  wave  before  it,  and  does  not  do  so  when  it  moves  be- 
tween the  surface  of  the  water  and  its  bed.  What  one  asks  occurs 
because  the  water  of  the  surface  borders  on  the  air,  whereas  the  water 
that  is  between  the  surface  of  the  water  and  its  bed  borders  on  the 
water  that  is  above  and  the  water  that  is  below.  f  41  r. 

Of  the  water  that  falls  from  the  weirs  of  rivers,  that  part  will  have 
its  straight  course  shut  in  which  has  the  most  powerful  fall: 

This  comes  about  because  water  with  a  powerful  fall  hollows  out  the 
soil  of  the  spot  on  which  it  strikes  and  deposits  it  where  its  course  is 
more  feeble  than  beneath  the  reflex  movement  of  the  water;  this  as  it 
moves  towards  the  sky  becomes  more  feeble  with  each  degree  of  its 
movement  until  at  last  it  loses  all  its  power. 

And  as  in  this  reflex  action  its  power  ebbs  it  lets  fall  below  it  all  the 
things  of  weight  taken  from  the  spot  where  it  has  struck,  and  after  this 
inundation  the  water  becomes  lowered  and  finds  itself  shut  in  between 
the  matter  which  it  formerly  carried  and  the  bank  from  which  it  has 
descended. 

Of  the  waters  that  descend  in  torrents  from  the  weirs  of  rivers  only 
that  will  preserve  its  straight  course  beyond  this  torrent  of  which  the 
fall  was  feeblest  and  slowest. 

This  happens  because  that  which  moves  slowly  strikes  feebly,  and 
therefore  it  follows  that  it  only  raises  itself  a  little  from  the  bed  on 
which  it  strikes,  and  in  consequence  deposits  but  little  in  the  reflex 
movement  of  the  water.  And  this  is  why  after  this  deluge  the  bank  here 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  683 

remains  low,  and  all  the  water  that  falls  follows  its  course  where  the 
bank  is  lower,  and  consequently  the  straight  course  of  all  the  water  of 
the  river  will  remain  with  the  water  that  has  a  feeble  fall.       f  42  v. 

Of  the  things  borne  by  the  water  which  have  part  of  themselves  in 
the  air  and  part  in  the  water: 

If  a  thing  is  borne  by  the  water  being  half  in  the  water  and  half  in 
the  air,  and  the  air  moves  with  a  speed  equal  to  the  speed  of  the  water, 
then  this  movable  thing  will  be  in  the  first  stage  of  swiftness  of  move- 
ment. 

If  the  air  is  slower  than  the  movement  of  the  water  which  moves  in 
the  same  direction  as  the  air,  the  movement  of  the  movable  thing  will 
be  slower  than  if  these  movements  of  air  and  water  were  equal,  and  it 
will  be  so  much  slower  in  proportion  as  these  movements  of  air  and 
water  are  more  different. 

If  the  movement  of  the  air  is  swifter  than  that  of  the  water1  which 
moves  in  the  same  direction,  then  this  movement  of  the  object  will  be- 
come more  rapid,  and  the  more  so  as  this  air  is  swifter  than  the  water.1 

If  the  movement  of  the  air  against  the  course  of  the  water  is  of  equal 
speed  to  that  of  this  water  against  the  air,  the  movable  thing  will  follow 
the  course  of  the  water  if  it  has  more  contact  with  the  water  than  with 
the  air:  it  will  do  the  contrary  if  it  has  more  contact  with  the  air  than 
with  the  water.  f  43  v. 

How  a  leaf  is  whirled  about  along  different  lines  in  the  depth  of  the

turning  itself  over  or  not  turning  over,  and  doing  the  same  in  the 
width  of  the  water  which  moves  it.  And  this  springs  from  the  different 
movements  of  the  water  with  its  different  slanting  and  eddying  courses. 
Here  one  may  place  objects  of  different  shapes,  and  one  will  have  made

684  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

THE  ORDER  OF  THE  BOOK 

To  set  forth  the  conditions  of  the  waters  that  spring  forth  within  the 
air,  and  their  percussions  made  with  different  degrees  of  power,  quan- 
tity, length  of  movements  and  variety  of  slant,  I  will  institute  a  com- 
parison between  the  four  principal  winds,  namely:  north,  south,  east 
and  west;  and  with  these  conditions  I  shall  equip  myself  to  give 
information  as  to  the  aforesaid  movements  of  the  water  within  the  air; 
as  a  result  this  description  will  be  briefer  and  more  expeditious. 

f  45  r. 

These  are  the  four  ways  in  which  the  waters  moving  in  the  same 
manner  penetrate  one  another  with  lines  that  slant  towards  the  centre 
of  the  earth. 

These  four  demonstrations  are  sufficient  to  prove  the  four  principal 
effects  that  the  waters  produce  as  they  strike  one  another  within  the 
air.  Of  which  the  first  is  that  in  which  the  more  slanting  penetrates  the 
less  slanting,  and  penetrates  it  in  part  and  carries  with  it  the  part  that 
has  been  struck. 

In  the  second  demonstration  the  less  slanting  penetrates  the  more 
slanting  in  part  and  carries  with  it  the  part  that  has  been  struck.  In 
the  third  demonstration  the  more  slanting  water  carries  away  with  it 
entirely  the  less  slanting  water.  The  fourth  does  the  opposite,  in  that 
the  less  slanting  water  carries  away  with  it  entirely  the  more  slanting. 

f  45  v. 

If  the  earth  were  [not]  spherical  no  part  of  it  would  be  uncovered 
by  the  sphere  of  the  water. 

You  will  never  find  a  flat  piece  of  the  earth  without  the  water  upon 
it  being  of  convex  shape  standing  in  the  middle  of  this  level  surface. 
And  this  water  will  never  move  towards  the  extremities  of  this  plain. 
Therefore  upon  a  surface  that  is  absolutely  flat  there  may  be  water  of 
varying  degrees  of  depth. 

It  is  impossible  to  find  any  flat  part  in  the  surface  of  any  very  great 
expanse  of  water. 

The  deep  recesses  in  the  ocean  bed  are  everlasting,  the  summits  of 
the  mountains  are  the  contrary:  it  follows  that  the  earth  is  spherical 
and  all  covered  with  water  and  that  it  will  be  inhabitable. 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  685 

An  object  which  is  carried  by  the  course  of  the  water  ...  in  the 
course  of  less  power:  if  it  is  slanting  below  it  will  move  towards  the 
bottom,  and  so  it  will  move  according  to  the  direction  of  its  slant. 

Of  the  objects  carried  between  two  currents  of  water  only  that  one 
will  proceed  without  being  turned  upside  down  which  is  in  the  middle 
of  two  currents  of  equal  movement. 

But  that  will  be  in  continual  revolution  over  and  over  which  is  in 
the  middle  of  two  unequal  currents. 

An  object  will  not  make  any  lateral  revolution  when  it  moves  be- 
tween currents  equal  in  movement;  and  so  conversely.  f  52  v. 

Of  the  movement  of  a  thing  that  slants  irregularly  in  water  which 
has  a  regular  current:  it  will  proceed  to  turn  continually  when  below 
the  surface  of  the  water,  and  that  in  which  the  slant  is  regular  will  not 
make  any  turn. 

When  the  upper  part  of  the  straight  side  of  the  object  and  the  lower 
part  are  struck  by  an  equal  current  this  object  will  make  a  lateral 
revolution.  f  53  v. 

[The  percussion  of  water] 

All  water  after  it  has  struck  against  an  object  is  divided  into  four 
different  and  principal  movements,  namely  right  and  left,  high  and 
low;  and  the  low  movement  causes  injury  to  its  bed. 

Of  the  four  principal  movements  which  water  makes  as  it  divides 
in  its  reflex  action,  that  will  be  more  rapid  which  is  reflected  at  a  more 
acute  angle.  f  54  r. 

OF  THINGS  CARRIED  BY  THE  WATER 

Of  the  things  carried  by  the  course  of  the  waters  that  which  has  a 
larger  part  of  itself  in  the  air  responds  to  the  movement  of  the  air 
more  than  to  that  of  the  water;  and  so  conversely  that  which  has  a 
larger  part  of  itself  in  the  water  will  follow  the  course  of  this  water 
more  than  that  of  the  air. 

See  in  the  windings  of  the  canals  where  the  water  is  swifter  below, 
in  the  middle,  and  above,  and  of  this  make  a  book. 

The  pipe  by  which  water  is  drawn  to  a  height  receives  less  damage 
than  that  pipe  along  which  water  is  driven;  and  this  is  due  to  the  fact 


686  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

that  in  the  first  case  the  motive  power  is  above  and  in  the  second  it  is 
below. 

Where  the  water  is  most  rapid,  it  wears  away  most  the  bed  on  which 
it  rubs. 

Where  the  water  is  most  shut  in,  it  becomes  most  rapid  and  in  its 
passage  wears  away  its  bed  most.  f  65  r. 

The  object  always  changes  the  order  of  the  nature  of  the  waves  thai 
have  been  commenced. 

The  current  a  b  has  one  order  and  the  object  which  receives  its  per- 
cussion throws  it  over  completely  and  changes  it  to  another  figure. 

If  you  wish  to  form  a  correct  impression  of  all  the  shapes  of  the 
waves  and  the  courses  of  the  waters,  observe  the  clear  water  where  it 
is  shallow  beneath  the  rays  of  the  sun,  and  you  will  see,  by  means  of 
this  sun,  all  the  shadows  and  lights  of  the  said  waves  and  of  the  things 
carried  by  the  water. 

The  sphere  of  the  water  increases  and  decreases  sensibly  or  insensi- 
bly, according  to  the  greater  or  less,  more  universal  or  less  universal 
deluges  of  the  waters  given  back  to  this  sphere  of  the  water.

EDDIES 

Eddies  are  always  the  intermingling  of  two  streams  of  water,  that 
is,  the  falling  and  the  reflex. 

All  the  water  which  in  the  currents  of  the  rivers  tarries  behind  the 
objects  in  these  currents  has  no  other  exit  than  by  contact  with  the 
aforesaid  currents. 

The  eddies  which  turn  back  are  always  those  of  the  swiftest  water, 

And  the  eddies  that  are  turned  in  the  direction  that  the  stream  is 
flowing  are  those  of  the  water  which  tarries  in  the  stream's  course. 

Here  the  law  of  the  waters  in  their  eddies  does  not  fail,  because  the 
water  that  becomes  slow,  turns  back,  and  makes  the  eddies  in  the  op- 
posite direction  to  its  movement,  as  do  the  eddies  of  the  swiftest  water. 
And  for  this  reason  these  eddies,  whether  of  the  slow  or  of  the  rapid 
water,  mingle  together  and  redouble  their  power;  but  not  entirely 
because  the  slow  eddy  in  mingling  with  the  swift  becomes  swifter  than 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  687 

at  first,  and  the  swift  eddy  as  it  embraces  and  unites  with  that  which 
is  slower  acquires  slowness. 

The  hollow  in  the  swift  waters  caused  by  the  submersion  of  the 
eddies  will  point  towards  the  approach  of  the  waters,  and  in  the  slow 
waters  it  will  point  in  the  direction  in  which  they  are  flowing.

COMMENCEMENT  OF  THE  BOOK 

A  drop  is  that  which  does  not  detach  itself  from  the  rest  of  the  water 
unless  the  power  of  its  weight  is  more  than  its  adhesion  to  the  water 
with  which  it  is  joined. 

That  drop  is  formed  more  slowly  which  has  a  slower  movement  of 
water  at  its  creation. 

All  the  movements  made  on  the  surface  of  water  are  also  made  at 
each  successive  stage  of  its  depth,  and  likewise  in  each  part  of  its 
length;  and  this  is  learnt  from  the  grasses  that  grow  on  the  beds  of 
the  streams.  f  66  v. 

Water  that  falls  in  the  air  separates  itself  with  difficulty  from  its 
bulk,  and  the  sign  of  this  is  found  in  the  curve  that  it  produces  and 
the  winding  of  one  of  its  parts  round  the  other,  between  which  the 
film  of  water  is  interposed.  f  67  r. 

If  the  earth  covered  by  the  sphere  of  the  water  is  more  or  less  heavy 
than  if  it  were  not  so  covered: 

I  reply  that  the  heavy  substance  weighs  more  which  is  in  the  middle 
of  the  lighter. 

Therefore  the  earth  which  is  covered  by  air  is  heavier  than  that 
which  is  covered  by  water. 
[Diagram] 

I  say: — the  centre  of  gravity  of  the  pyramid  being  placed  at  the 
centre  of  the  earth,  it  will  change  its  centre  of  gravity  if  it  is  sub- 
sequently covered  in  part  by  the  sphere  of  the  water,  and  I  give  an 
example  with  two  cylindrical  weights  that  are  equal  and  similar,  of 
which  one  is  half  in  the  water  and  the  other  entirely  in  the  water:  I 
say  that  that  which  is  half  out  of  the  water  is  the  heavier,  as  has  been 
proved. 

Suppose  there  to  be  a  straight  line  equal   to  the  diameter  of  the.

sphere  of  the  water,  which  touches  the  surface  of  the  sphere  of  water 
in  the  centre  of  its  length.  One  asks  what  is  the  difference  between 
each  of  the  miles  of  the  descent  which  the  surface  of  this  sphere  makes 
below  the  said  line.  f  69  r. 

f  Centre  of  the  earth  and  watery  sphere} 

Because  the  centre  of  the  natural  gravity  of  the  earth  ought  to  be  in 
the  centre  of  the  world  the  earth  is  always  growing  lighter  in  some 
part,  and  the  part  that  becomes  lighter  pushes  upwards,  and  submerges 
as  much  of  the  opposite  part  as  is  necessary  for  it  to  join  the  centre  of 
its  aforesaid  gravity  to  the  centre  of  the  world;  and  the  sphere  of  the 
water  keeps  its  surface  steadily  equidistant  from  the  centre  of  the 
world. 

Where  the  sun  is  straight  above,  the  earth  grows  light;  covered  by 
the  air,  the  waters  and  the  snows  have  been  lacking  to  it,  and  on  the 
opposite  side  the  rains  and  the  snows  have  made  the  earth  heavy 
again  and  drive  it  towards  the  centre  of  the  world,  and  thrust  the  parts 
that  have  become  lightened  to  a  greater  distance  from  this  centre;  so 
therefore  the  sphere  of  this  water  preserves  an  equality  of  distance 
from  the  centre  of  its  sphere  but  not  of  gravity. 

Water  poured  in  the  air  at  a  concave  angle  becomes  spread  out  in  a 
sheet,  and  it  remains  spread  out  in  a  sheet  more  on  the  side  of  the 
angle  where  this  water  makes  more  contact;  and  on  the  opposite  side 
the  sheet  of  water  will  leap  up  and  make  its  union  at  first  in  the  form 
of  an  open  sheath.  f  70  r. 

[Water  of  the  sea  and  of  rivers~\ 

The  sea  beneath  the  equinox  is  raised  by  the  heat  of  the  sun,  and 
acquires  movement  over  every  part  of  the  hill  or  portion  of  the  water 
that  rises  in  order  to  give  equality  and  restore  perfection  to  its  sphere. 

If  an  outlet  of  water  with  sixteen  ounces  descent  in  each  mile  yields 
me  sixteen  measures  of  water,  how  much  will  the  same  outlet  afford 
with  eight  ounces  descent  per  mile? 

The  revolutions  of  the  cross-eddies  acquire  size  and  slowness  at  each 
stage  of  their  length. 

The  convulsions  of  the  reflex  movements  of  the  water  at  the  bottom 
of  rivers  destroy  the  circling  movements  of  the  longitudinal  eddies. 

The  water  of  the  sea  and  of  the  turbid  rivers  is  heavier  than  the 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  689 

other    waters,    and    as    a   consequence   offers   more    resistance   to   the 
weights  it  carries. 

The  water  of  the  sea  offers  more  resistance  because  the  weight  of  the 
salt  that  is  mixed  with  it  is  liquefied,  and  it  is  inseparable  from  it  with- 
out the  heat  that  dries  up  the  water;  but  the  turbid  part  of  the  water 
is  separated  from  it  by  heat  and  when  the  water  is  at  rest.       f  70  v. 

\Movement  of  water  in  the  air  and  in  the  water] 

The  movement  that  water  makes  in  the  air  follows  for  some  distance 
the  line  of  the  sides  of  the  small  holes  through  which  it  descends.  It  is 
not  thus  with  the  discontinuous  quantity  that  the  stone  shows  itself  to 
be  when  thrown  by  the  circular  movement  of  the  man's  arm;  this  fol- 
lows the  straight  movement;  which  the  water  does  not  do  on  account 
of  it  being  spread  out  in  a  sheet,  for  this  in  a  long  space  of  movement 
collects  all  the  parts  of  the  water  together. 

The  impressions  of  the  movements  made  by  the  water  within  the 
water  are  more  permanent  than  the  impressions  that  the  water  makes 
within  the  air;  and  this  takes  place  because  water  within  water  is  de- 
void of  weight,  as  is  proved  in  the  fifth,  but  only  the  impetus  weighs 
and  this  moves  this  water  that  has  no  weight  until  it  is  itself  con- 
sumed. 

The  impressions  of  the  movements  of  water  are  more  permanent 
when  the  water  carried  by  the  impetus  enters  into  a  sheet  of  water 
(pelago)  with  slower  movement,  and  conversely. 

The  impressions  made  by  the  water  within  the  air  are  destroyed  in 
the  first  movement  that  they  make  towards  the  earth,  because  the  im- 
petus is  consumed  in  the  natural  movement  that  is  produced  in  the 
water.  f  71  r. 

OF  THE  MOVEMENTS  OF  WATER 

The  falls  of  water  that  intersect  in  the  air  become  filled  with  air  in 
their  reflex  movement. 

Of  the  falls  of  water  which  strike  each  other  within  the  air  being  of 
equal  thickness,  that  which  descends  from  a  higher  part  of  its  reservoir 
will  join  itself  to  the  course  of  that  which  is  lower  and  will  complete 
its  course  with  it. 

Falling  water  which  then  runs  over  terraces  breaks  its  bed  very 
much  at  the  end  of  these  terraces. 


690  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

This  proceeds  from  the  fact  that  when  the  current  of  the  water 
reaches  the  last  stage  of  these  terraces  it  falls  and  raises  itself  from  the 
bottom,  burying  itself  so  much  the  more  as  its  fall  is  deeper,  because 
the  fall  is  more  powerful  in  great  descents  than  in  lesser  ones. 

All  water,  when  it  strikes  the  bottom  or  upon  another  object,  divides 
and  runs  in  different  directions. 

All  water,  when  it  surges  up,  divides  at  the  surface  and  runs  in  dif- 
ferent directions,  and  so  much  the  more  as  the  sheet  of  water  is  more 
tranquil.  f  71  v. 

The  simple  movements  of  the  waters  are  those  which  act  simply  with 
their  simple  movement  of  whatever  kind  it  may  be. 

Composite  movements  are  created  by  different  movements  and 
these  are  very  powerful  in  different  functions. 

The  wave  is  slower  at  the  summit  than  upon  its  sides. 

The  falling  movement  is  more  rapid  than  the  reflex. 

Joined  together,  the  greatest  and  the  least  slowness  of  the  waves,  that 
is  of  the  wave  in  itself  with  its  sides  and  summits,  become  equal  to 
the  common  course  of  their  stream,  and  this  is  to  be  adduced  in  the 
conclusions,  that  is  to  say  to  prove  them.  f  72  r. 

[Of  the  raising  of  water  in  nature  and  by  artifice] 

If  the  water  which  gushes  forth  from  the  high  summits  of  the 
mountains  comes  from  the  sea,  the  weight  of  which  drives  it  up  there 
so  that  it  is  higher  than  these  mountains,  why  has  this  portion  of  water 
the  capacity  of  raising  itself  to  so  great  a  height,  and  of  penetrating 
the  earth  with  such  difficulty  and  length  of  time,  while  it  has  not  been 
granted  to  the  rest  of  the  element  of  water  to  do  the  same,  although 
this  borders  on  the  air  which  would  not  be  able  to  resist  it  and  so 
prevent  the  whole  from  rising  to  the  same  height  as  the  aforesaid  part? 

You  who  have  found  such  an  invention  must  needs  return  to  the 
study  of  natural  things,  for  you  will  be  found  lacking  in  cognate 
knowledge,  and  of  this  you  have  made  great  provision  by  means  of  the 
property  of  the  friar  of  which  you  have  come  into  possession  [P].1

THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  691 

Water  falling  into  a  channel  of  width  equal  to  the  width  of  the 
water  that  falls  will  make  a  deep  hollow  within  the  surface  of  the 
water. 

Water  falling  into  [a  channel]  where  the  width  is  greater  than  the 
said  fall  will  not  make  a  very  great  hollow  in  the  surface  of  the 
water,  on  account  of  the  eddies,  which  cause  the  water  to  bend  in  the 
hollow  caused  by  this  fall. 

Water  which  clears  away  the  bottom  on  which  it  hurls  itself  rap- 
idly or  slowly  in  all  its  width,  depth  or  narrowness,  its  seething  mass 
being  tossed  back  by  the  bed  of  the  watery  expanse,  is  in  part  caught 
up  again  to  the  surface  of  the  water,  there  to  make  its  various  falling 
and  reflex  movements,  in  part  returns  to  where  was  its  first  fall,  bury- 
ing itself  there  with  it  and  then  returning  up  in  lateral  eddies,  and  in 
part  falling  back  in  the  middle  of  the  seething  mass  and  spreading 
itself  out  with  slow  movement  round  the  centre  of  its  fall.

THINGS  CARRIED  IN  RIVERS 

A  wide  object  borne  by  the  current  of  the  river  between  the  surface 
and  the  bed  of  the  river,  if  it  should  meet  with  water  that  is  slower 
than  that  which  bears  it  and  should  find  itself  at  that  time  slanting 
in  the  direction  of  the  approaching  river,  will  immediately  leap  from 
the  bed  to  the  surface  of  the  water;  and  if  this  slant  is  pointing  in  the 
opposite  direction  to  the  course  of  the  water  then  in  encountering 
the  slow  current  it  will  suddenly  precipitate  itself  towards  the  bottom; 
and  if  this  slant  looks  to  the  right  or  left  of  the  breadth  of  the  stream 


692  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

it  will  throw  itself  to  this  right  or  left  side  of  the  stream  and  so  will 
continue  in  any  direction.  1  7S  r. 


SEA-MUD  AND  FOSSILS 

If  the  mountains  had  not  remained  in  great  part  uncovered  by  the 
waters,  the  courses  of  the  rivers  would  not  have  been  able  to  carry  so 
much  mud  into  the  sea  as  exists  at  a  great  elevation,  mingled  with  the 
animals  which  have  been  enclosed  by  it. 

The  revolutions  of  the  reflex  water  in  returning  to  the  current  of  its 
river  penetrate  it  more  in  its  lower  parts  than  on  its  surface;  and  this 
proceeds  from  the  fact  that  the  current,  by  the  seventh,  is  swifter  above 
than  below,  and  is  in  consequence  more  powerful  above,  and  therefore 
less  penetrated  by  the  percussion  of  this  reflex  water  above  than  below. 

The  eddies  formed  by  the  percussion  of  the  reflex  water  in  the  course 
of  the  falling  water  are  of  two  kinds,  of  which  one  is  produced  towards 
the  bottom  and  revolves  vertically  through  the  length  of  the  stream, 
the  other  is  upon  the  surface  and  revolves  right  and  left  through  the 
breadth  of  the  stream.  The  lower  is  produced  by  the  falling  down 
again  of  the  seething  mass  towards  the  bottom,  and  that  on  the  surface 
by  the  revolving  movement  striking  into  the  surface  current,    f  78  v.

against  the  bottom  and  break  in  pieces. 

Write  therefore  all  the  effects  of  the  things  that  become  submerged 
in  any  extremity  of  this  middle  water,  which  always  submerges  its 
extremities  because  it  is  in  the  centre  of  all  the  reflex  movements 
towards  the  bottom  of  its  expanse  of  water.  f  81  v. 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  693 

Of  the  earth.  Every  heavy  substance  tends  to  descend,  and  the  lofty 
things  will  not  retain  their  height  but  with  time  they  will  all  descend, 
and  thus  in  time  the  earth  will  become  a  sphere,  and  as  a  consequence 
will  be  completely  covered  with  water,  and  the  underground  channels 
will  remain  without  movement. 

Of  the  convex  wave.  If  the  wave  created  by  the  fall  of  the  water 
of  a  canal  of  uniform  breadth  and  depth  will  be  of  long  movement 
or  no. 

Of  the  concave  wave.  If  the  concave  wave  created  by  the  water  that 
falls  abruptly  from  the  open  canal  under  a  sluice  will  be  of  long 
movement  in  a  canal  of  uniform  breadth  and  depth.  f  84  r. 

Water  which  runs  through  a  canal  of  uniform  emptiness  and  fills 
all  its  first  smooth  part,  will  fill  all  the  other  straight  and  slanting 
parts  and  will  move  with  equal  swiftness. 

The  movements  of  the  heavy  elements  are  not  to  the  centre  in  order 
to  go  to  this  centre,  but  because  the  medium  in  which  they  are  cannot 
resist  them,  and  when  they  find  resistance  in  their  element  this  body 
no  longer  has  weight  and  does  not  seek  to  penetrate  to  the  centre. 

Water  in  air  weighs  and  descends  by  the  shortest  path.  It  divides 
and  opens  the  air  which  is  below  its  centre  of  gravity  with  all  its  parts 
equally,  and  it  does  not  divide  the  air  that  is  upon  its  sides  because  it 
is  not  situated  above  it.  And  because  of  this  it  makes  a  hollow  in  the 
air  of  very  short  length  until  it  reaches  that  which  resists  it;  and  as 
this  resistance  is  that  of  water  the  water  that  falls  through  the  air  no 
longer  seeks  to  go  the  centre,  because  it  no  longer  divides  the  water 
as  it  did  with  the  air;  therefore  the  heavy  substance  moves  downwards 
where  it  meets  with  no  resistance,  and  not  in  order  to  go  to  the  centre.

BOOK  NINE.  OF  THE  ACCIDENTAL  RISINGS  OF  WATER 

If  with  a  sluice  the  larger  body  of  water  is  divided  by  the  narrower 
and  the  movement  of  the  water  is  from  the  narrower  to  the  larger, 
the  water  which  rises  under  the  sluice  will  leap  on  to  the  larger  water, 
and  by  its  falling  back  it  will  hollow  the  bed  of  the  canal  in  several 
places  with  different  leaps.  p  88  r.

[Boo\  of  the  treatise  on  water] 

If  the  cylindrical  wave  shall  strike  the  eddies  produced  about  one 
of  the  extended  banks,  these  pent-up  eddies  will  be  contracted  and 
acquire  great  power  to  excavate  beneath  the  bank  and  cause  it  to  fall 
in. 

Order  of  the  book. 

Put  at  the  beginning  what  a  river  can  do  of  equal  depth  and  slant 
of  bed  on  its  bank,  where  lie  objects  of  various  kinds.  Then  place  these 
objects  two  by  two.  Then  place  them  to  face  the  opposite  bank,  in  the 
same  variety,  and  describe  what  the  waters  do  when  they  intersect  one 
another  in  the  centre  of  the  stream,  and  the  obstacle  they  afford  to  the 
water  reflected  by  the  opposite  bank.  And  then  describe  what  each  does 
in  its  bed,  that  is  how  it  rises  and  settles  itself. 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  695 

The  side  of  the  wave  when  it  makes  its  rapid  tailing  movement  is 
the  end  of  the  slow  reflex  movement.  It  follows  that  the  movement  of 
the  valley  of  the  wave  is  swift  and  the  crest  of  the  wave  is  slow. 

f  90  v. 

CURRENTS  OF  RIVERS 

If  the  course  of  the  river  is  contracted  on  one  of  its  sides  it  produces 
a  half-cylindrical  wave  which  is  swift;  and  the  eddies  which  are  pro- 
duced between  the  contracted  bank  and  the  cylindrical  wave  occasion 
the  laying  bare  and  crumbling  away  of  this  contracted  bank. 

If  the  banks  should  contract  equally  on  each  side  of  the  current  and 
opposite,  then  the  cylindrical  waves  will  intersect,  and  after  this  inter- 
section they  will  descend  and  strike  upon  the  bank  and  cause  it  to  fall 
headlong. 

But  if  the  contraction  of  one  bank  should  be  lower  than  that  of  the 
other,  then  the  upper  cylindrical  wave  can  enter  under  the  lower. 

Here  it  is  necessary,  in  the  commentary,  to  define  the  distances  of 
the  contractions  of  the  banks  and  their  breadths.  f  91  r. 

[Of  canals,  rivers  and  eddies] 

The  bank  which  is  made  to  curve  inwards  in  order  to  give  greater 
breadth  to  the  canal  is  the  cause  of  the  sudden  forming  of  an  eddy, 
and  this  bores  down  and  makes  a  deep  hole  at  the  base  of  the  bank 
and  so  becomes  the  cause  of  its  fall. 

This  is  proved  by  the  first  of  the  third,  which  shows  that  the  river 
in  acquiring  sudden  breadth  of  space  acquires  also  sudden  breadth  of 
water,  and  the  water  thus  widened  comes  also  to  lower  itself  in  depth; 
and  so  it  suddenly  creates  a  current  which  hurls  itself  upon  the  bank 
where  it  has  been  widened,  and  striking  it  divides  itself  into  two 
eddies,  one  of  which  (the  more  powerful,  as  c  b  a)  in  order  to  be 
enclosed  throws  itself  vigorously  straight  towards  the  bottom;  and  by 
the  ninth  which  says  that  as  the  eddy  will  be  most  easily  penetrated 
which  has  the  lips  of  its  mouth  least  slanting,  it  will  have  them  quite 
straight. 

Water  brings  about  the  fall  of  that  bank  of  which  the  canal  acquires 
a  sudden  breadth. 

If  the  canal  gains  on  each  side  sudden  breadth  it  produces  eddies  on 


696  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

each  side;  if  these  are  united  at  the  centre  of  the  breadth  of  this  canal 
it  will  make  of  itself  a  sudden  and  great  depth. 
All  these  figures  have  to  result  from  experience.  f  91  v. 

[Cylindrical  waves] 

The  more  the  half-cylindrical  wave  moves  the  more  it  descends,  and 
the  more  it  spreads  itself  out  the  swifter  it  becomes. 

When  there  are  two  unequal  cylindrical  waves  of  which  the  larger 
comes  into  existence  before  the  smaller,  this  smaller  wave  intersects 
the  larger  and  passes  above  it.  And  this  happens  because  the  larger 
which  is  created  first,  when  it  is  opposite  to  the  smaller,  is  spread  out 
and  lowered,  and  the  lesser  which  strikes  it,  being  high,  strikes  the 
lowness  of  the  greater  one,  and  not  finding  any  obstacle  as  high  as 
itself  runs  over  it  and  falls  headlong  on  the  opposite  side  and  follows 
its  initial  impetus. 

But  if  the  lesser  of  the  unequal  cylindrical  waves  starts  higher  in  the 
river  than  the  greater,  then  this  greater  follows  its  natural  course,  and 
the  lesser  follows  the  course  of  the  greater.  f  92  r. 

If  the  cylindrical  waves  clash  and  do  not  intersect  as  far  as  the  cen- 
tre, the  middle  part  which  clashes  leaps  back  and  passes  above  the 
part  that  does  not  clash. 

When  two  cylindrical  waves  of  equal  size  and  power  clash  abso- 
lutely they  each  turn  back  Completely  without  any  penetration  one  of 
the  other. 

But  if  the  cylindrical  waves  are  unequal  in  size,  neither  the  larger 
nor  the  smaller  will  observe  their  law,  because  the  larger  does  not 
bend  and  the  lesser  unites  with  the  larger. 

But  if  when  the  waves  are  equal  the  rise  of  the  one  is  before  that 
of  the  other,  their  blows  will  not  be  delivered  with  equal  power; 
consequently  the  course  of  the  second  will  bend  before  that  of  the 
first.  f  92  v. 

Water  that  moves  between  a  bank  and  a  straight  smooth  bed  will 
not  make  a  wave  of  any  kind. 

What  is  thus  stated  takes  place  because  a  wave  is  only  created  by  a 
reflex  movement,  and  the  reflex  movement  arises  from  the  percussion 
of  the  falling  movement  which  is  made  upon  the  particular  object  at 


THE   NATURE  OF   WATER  697 

the  bottom  or  the  sides  of  the  canal;  and  if  in  these  places  there  are  no 
particular  objects  then  by  what  has  been  said  it  will  not  create  any 
wave,  this  water  being  made  by  minute  upward  movements  which 
only  raise  themselves  a  little  from  the  bottom,  so  that  they  do  not 
make  waves  by  coming  to  the  surface. 

The  simple  half-cylindrical  wave  is  formed  upon  some  small  object 
that  is  joined  to  the  bank;  the  water  that  strikes  it  there  makes  a  long 
wave  in  the  shape  of  a  half-column  which  takes  its  course  slantwise 
towards  the  opposite  bank,  and  dies  there  and  is  reborn. 

Let  a  be  the  object,  placed  upon  the  bank  a  o  of  the  canal  n  o  m  p. 

I  say  that  the  water  which  strikes  upon  this  object  will  make  a  wave 
which  by  its  being  continually  reformed  will  also  make  itself  continu- 
ous; and  it  would  be  always  so  if  it  were  not  interrupted  by  the  com- 
mon course  of  the  water  of  the  canal,  which  all  strikes  on  this  wave 
and  drives  it  unceasingly  in  every  stage  of  its  length,  so  that  at  the 
end  it  directs  it  according  to  its  ordinary  course.  f  93  v. 

\  Currents  and  falls  of  water] 

In  water  of  ordinary  speed  the  middle  water  will  have  tiny  ripples. 

The  water  that  is  interposed  between  the  mean  of  the  surface  and  its 
bed  is  not  of  the  nature  of  the  mean;  whereas  this  mean  of  the  surface 
receives  the  percussion  of  the  falling  and  the  reflex;  for  the  one  and 
the  other  to  be  within  the  boundary  falls  upon  the  other  water,  making 
percussion  of  the  air  as  of  a  heavy  thing,  and  as  a  heavy  thing  it  pene- 
trates within  the  other  water  struck  by  it. 

The  water  falls  at  first,  rises  up  again,  and  raises  itself  with  its  semi- 
cylindrical  wave  above  the  semi-cylindrical  wave  opposite  which  made 
its  fall  more  slanting.  f  94  r. 

[The  current  of  rivers] 

Water  that  descends  in  a  straight  river  moves  always  by  a  slanting 
course,  from  the  centre  to  the  opposite  banks  and  from  these  opposite 
banks  to  the  centre  of  the  river.  This  is  proved  by  the  ninth  of  this 
where  it  is  stated: — The  course  of  straight  rivers  is  always  higher  in 
the  centre  of  their  width  and  upon  the  sides  than  it  is  between  the 
centre  of  their  width  and  these  sides.  And  this  was  proved  by  the  sev- 
enth in  which  it  was  stated: — The  water  of  straight  rivers  never  flows 
in  a  straight  line  because  it  is  so  much  swifter  as  its  obstruction  is 


698  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

farther  removed  from  the  banks.  And  this  was  confirmed  where  I 
said : — Where  the  falling  movement  is  impeded  there  the  reflex  move- 
ment is  created;  and  by  the  tenth  of  this:  Always  between  the  falling 
and  the  reflex  movement  is  the  maximum  depression  in  the  expanse  of 
the  rivers;  and  by  the  eleventh :— After  the  last  height  of  the  reflex 
water  there  is  produced  the  beginning  of  the  falling  movement;  and 
by  the  twelfth: — The  falling  movement  of  the  waters  does  not  change 
into  the  reflex  movement  without  percussion  against  the  bed  or  the 
bank  of  the  river.  Where  the  water  strikes  the  bed  or  the  bank  of 
the  river  there  the  soil  of  the  bed  or  the  bank  of  the  river  becomes 
raised. 

Always  under  the  falling  movement  the  bed  of  the  river  becomes 
raised  and  its  height  is  restored  under  the  reflex  movement. 

The  lateral  slants  of  the  waters  which  move  continually  in  straight 
rivers  are  of  a  greater  or  less  degree  [of  slant]  according  as  these  wa- 
ters have  a  more  or  less  rapid  current.  g  14  v. 

[Density  of  water — fresh  and  salt] 

HOW  THE  OCEAN  DOES  NOT  PENETRATE  WITHIN 
THE  EARTH 

The  Ocean  does  not  penetrate  within  the  earth,  and  this  we  learn 
from  the  many  and  varied  springs  of  fresh  water  which  in  various 
places  of  this  Ocean  penetrate  from  the  bottom  to  its  surface.  The  same 
thing  also  is  shown  us  by  the  wells,  made  at  a  distance  of  more  than  a 
mile  from  the  said  Ocean,  which  are  filled  with  fresh  water;  and  this 
takes  place  because  the  fresh  water  is  lighter  than  the  salt  water  and  as 
a  consequence  more  penetrating. 

Which  weighs  more,  water  that  is  frozen  or  water  that  is  not  frozen  ? 

Fresh  water  penetrates  more  into  salt  water  than  salt  water  does  into 
fresh  water. 

That  fresh  water  penetrates  farther  into  salt  water  than  salt  water 
does  into  fresh  is  shown  us  by  a  thin  cloth,  dry  and  old,  that  hangs 
with  its  opposite  ends  at  an  equal  depth  in  two  different  bodies  of 
water,  of  which  the  surfaces  are  equally  low;  you  will  then  see  how 
the  fresh  water  will  raise  itself  so  much  higher  up  on  this  piece  of 
cloth  than  the  salt  water,  as  it  is  lighter  than  it.  g  38  r. 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  699 

OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  A  RIVER  WHICH  SHOOTS  FORTH 
SUDDENLY  UPON  ITS  DRY  BED 

The  course  that  the  water  takes  when  issuing  from  a  lake  into  a  dry 
river-bed  is  so  much  slower  or  swifter  as  the  river  is  wider  or  more 
confined  or  in  a  more  level  position  in  one  place  than  in  another. 

By  what  is  set  forth  the  flow  and  ebb  of  the  sea  which  enters  from 
the  Ocean  into  the  Mediterranean,  and  of  the  rivers  that  contend  with 
it,  raises  their  waters  so  much  the  more  or  less  as  the  sea  is  more  or  less 
confined.  g  48  r. 

WHY  WATER  IS  SALT 

Pliny  says  in  his  second  book,  in  the  hundred  and  third  chapter, 
that  the  water  of  the  sea  is  salt  because  the  heat  of  the  sun  scorches 
and  dries  up  the  moisture  and  sucks  it  up,  and  thereby  greatly  increases 
the  salt  savour  of  the  sea. 

But  this  cannot  be  admitted,  because  if  the  saltness  of  the  sea  were 
caused  by  the  heat  of  the  sun  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  lakes  and  pools 
and  marshes  would  be  more  salt  in  proportion  as  their  waters  have  less 
movement  and  depth,  but,  on  the  contrary,  experience  shows  us  that 
the  waters  of  these  marshes  are  entirely  free  from  saltness.  It  is  also 
stated  by  Pliny  in  the  same  chapter  that  this  saltness  might  arise  be- 
cause, after  the  subtraction  of  every  sweet  and  tenuous  portion  such  as 
the  heat  readily  draws  to  itself,  the  more  bitter  and  coarser  portion 
will  be  left  behind,  and  in  consequence  the  water  on  the  surface  is 
sweeter  than  that  at  the  bottom.  But  this  is  contradicted  by  the  reasons 
given  above,  whence  it  follows  that  the  same  thing  would  happen  with 
marshes  and  other  tracts  of  water  which  become  dried  up  by  the  heat. 
It  has  also  been  said  that  the  saltness  of  the  sea  is  the  sweat  of  the 
earth,  but  to  this  we  may  reply  that  then  all  the  springs  of  water  which 
penetrate  through  the  earth  would  be  salt. 

The  conclusion  therefore  is  that  the  saltness  of  the  sea  is  due  to  the 
numerous  springs  of  water,  which  in  penetrating  the  earth  find  the 
salt  mines,  and  dissolving  parts  of  these  carry  them  away  with  them 
to  the  Ocean,  and  to  the  other  seas  from  whence  they  are  never  lifted 
by  the  clouds  which  produce  the  rivers.  So  the  sea  would  be  more  salt 
in  our  times  than  it  has  ever  been  at  any  time  previously;  and  if  it 


7oo  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

were  argued  by  the  adversary  that  in  an  infinite  course  of  time  the 
sea  would  either  become  dried  up  or  congealed  into  salt,  to  this  I  reply 
that  the  salt  is  restored  to  the  earth  by  the  setting  free  of  the  earth 
which  is  raised  up  together  with  the  salt  it  has  acquired,  and  the 
rivers  restore  it  to  the  earth  over  which  they  flow. 

But — to  express  this  better — if  it  be  granted  that  the  world  is  ever- 
lasting it  must  needs  be  that  its  population  also  will  be  everlasting; 
and  that  therefore  the  human  race  has  perpetually  been  and  will  be 
consumers  of  salt;  and  if  the  whole  mass  of  the  earth  were  composed 
of  salt  it  would  not  suffice  for  human  food.  And  for  this  reason  we 
are  forced  to  conclude  either  that  the  substance  of  the  salt  is  everlast- 
ing as  is  the  world,  or  that  it  dies  and  is  renewed  together  with  the 
men  who  consume  it.  But  since  experience  teaches  us  that  it  does  not 
die,  as  is  shown  from  the  fact  of  fire  not  consuming  it,  and  from 
water  becoming  more  salt  in  proportion  as  it  is  dissolved  in  it,  and 
from  the  fact  that  when  water  evaporates  the  original  quantity  of  salt 
remains,  there  must  needs  pass  through  human  bodies  as  urine  or 
perspiration  or  the  other  excretions  that  are  found  there  as  much  salt 
as  is  brought  every  year  into  the  cities.  And  therefore  we  may  say 
that  the  rains  which  penetrate  through  the  earth  are  what  carry  back 
underneath  the  foundations  of  cities  and  their  peoples  through  the 
passages  of  the  earth  the  saltness  taken  from  the  sea;  and  that  the 
change  in  the  position  of  the  sea  which  was  over  all  the  mountains  has 
left  the  salt  in  the  mines  that  are  to  be  found  in  these  mountains. 

As  a  third  and  last  reason  we  may  say  that  salt  is  in  all  created 
things;  and  we  may  learn  this  from  passing  water  through  ashes  and 
the  refuse  of  things  which  have  been  burnt,  and  from  the  urine  of 
animals  and  the  excretions  which  proceed  from  their  bodies,  and  the 
earth  into  which  by  corruption  all  things  are  changed.

OF  THE  CHANGES  OF  THE  EARTH  1 

The  subterranean  courses  of  the  waters  like  those  which  are  made 
between  the  air  and  the  earth  are  those  which  unceasingly  wear  away 
and  deepen  the  beds  of  their  courses.

THE   NATURE   OF   WATER  701 

The  soil  carried  away  by  the  rivers  is  deposited  in  the  ultimate  parts 
of  their  courses;  or  rather  the  soil  carried  away  by  the  high  courses  of 
the  rivers  is  deposited  in  the  ultimate  descents  of  their  movements. 

Where  fresh  water  is  rising  to  the  surface  of  the  sea  it  is  a  manifest 
portent  of  the  creation  of  an  island  which  will  be  uncovered  more 
slowly  or  more  rapidly  as  the  quantity  of  the  water  that  rises  is  less  or 
greater  in  amount.  And  this  island  is  produced  by  the  quantity  of 
earth  or  deposit  of  stones  made  by  the  subterranean  course  of  the 
water  in  the  places  through  which  it  flows.  c  49  v. 

HOW  WATER  CONSUMES  AS  IT  FALLS 

The  falls  that  the  waters  make  at  their  banks  always  wear  away  the 
bases  of  these  banks  and  cause  them  to  fall  headlong  on  their  founda- 
tions. This  is  proved: — if  the  height  of  the  bank  a  c  from  which  falls 
the  water  a  n,  striking  and  consuming  the  place  struck  m  n  c,  be  the 
centre  of  the  percussion  upon  which  are  divided  the  reflex  movements 
n  m  o  and  neb,  which  in  each  direction  consume  the  bank  that  is 
chafed  by  their  revolving  movements,  then  as  the  banks  find  them- 
selves thus  consumed  their  supports  collapse  on  the  side  on  which  their 
prop  fails. 

The  water  which  falls  from  a  h  to  n  m  will  proceed  to  deepen  all 
the  bed  from  where  it  falls  as  far  as  the  lowest  level  of  the  place  where 
it  falls,  from  a  b  to  c  d.  g  50  v. 

WHETHER  THE  WATER  CAN  RISE  FROM  THE  SEA  TO  THE 
TOPS  OF  THE  MOUNTAINS 

The  water  of  the  sea  cannot  penetrate  from  the  roots  to  the  summits 
of  the  mountains  which  border  upon  it  but  only  raises  itself  as  far  as 
the  aridity  of  the  mountain  1  draws  it.  And  if  on  the  contrary  the  rain 
which  penetrates  from  the  summit  of  the  mountain  to  its  roots  which 
border  on  the  sea,  descends  and  softens  the  opposite  slope  of  the  same 
mountain,  and  draws  the  water  continually  as  does  the  syphon  which 
pours  through  its  longest  side,  it  must  be  this  which  draws  up  to  a 
height  the  water  of  the  sea;  thus  if  s  n  were  the  surface  of  the  sea  and

702  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

the  rain  descends  from  the  summit  of  the  mountain  a  to  n  on  one  side 
of  it  and  descends  on  the  other  side  from  a  to  ra,  this  without  doubt 
would  be  the  method  of  distillation  of  a  filter  or  as  happens  through 
the  tube  called  a  syphon;  and  the  water  which  has  softened  the  moun- 
tain by  the  great  rain  which  descends  from  the  two  opposite  sides 
would  constantly  attract  the  rain  a  n  on  its  longest  side  together  with 
the  water  of  the  sea,  if  the  side  of  the  mountain  a  m  were  longer  than 
the  side  a  n;  but  this  cannot  be  because  no  part  of  the  earth  that  is  not 
submerged  by  the  ocean  can  be  lower  than  this  ocean.  c  70  r. 

[With  drawings] 

These  convolutions  must  be  made  with  coloured  water  falling 
blindly  into  clear  water.  g  90  v. 

Running  water  has  within  itself  an  infinite  number  of  movements 
which  are  greater  or  less  than  its  principal  course. 

This  is  proved  by  the  things  supported  within  two  streams  of  water 
which  are  equal  to  the  water  in  weight.  If  the  waters  are  clear  they 
show  well  the  true  movement  of  the  waters  that  conducts  them,  be- 
cause sometimes  the  fall  of  the  wave  towards  the  bottom  bears  them 
with  it  so  that  they  strike  upon  this  bottom;  and  they  would  be  re- 
flected back  with  it  to  the  surface  of  the  water  if  the  floating  body 
were  spherical;  but  it  frequently  happens  that  the  wave  does  not  bear 
them  back,  because  they  are  wider  or  narrower  in  one  direction  than 
in  the  other,  and  being  thus  irregular  in  shape  they  are  struck  upon 
the  side  that  is  largest  by  another  reflex  wave  which  proceeds  to  roll 
over  and  over  this  movable  thing  which  moves  wherever  it  is  carried, 
its  movement  being  sometimes  swift  and  sometimes  slow,  and  turning 
sometimes  to  right  and  sometimes  to  left,  at  one  instant  upwards  at 
another  downwards,  turning  over  and  turning  back  upon  itself,  now 
in  one  direction  and  now  in  another,  obeying  all  the  forces  that  have 
power  to  move  it,  and  in  the  struggles  carried  on  by  these  moving 
forces  going  always  as  the  booty  of  the  victor.  g  93  r. 

There  can  be  no  flow  and  ebb  unless  several  rivers  discharge  them- 
selves in  the  same  expanse  of  water.  g  95  r. 

In  the  course  of  the  year  the  amount  of  the  water  that  rises  will  be 
as  great  as  of  that  which  descends  in  the  rivers  and  the  air.     h  29  v.

\  Course  of  rivers] 

Ail  the  things  which  are  lighter  than  sand  will  be  left  in  the  lower 
part  of  the  river  underneath  the  beginning  of  the  fall  of  the  wave. 

Where  the  water  has  least  movement  the  surface  of  the  bottom  will 
be  of  the  finest  mud  or  sand. 

Where  the  course  of  turbid  water  meanders  among  the  gnarled 
roots  of  thickets  it  will  deposit  much  sand  or  mud  through  the  many 
twists  of  its  eddies.  h  30  r. 


OF  THE  COURSES  OF  MILLS 

The  water  which  gives  less  weight  to  its  course  is  swifter. 

The  water  which  is  swifter  drives  its  wheel  faster. 

That  gives  less  weight  to  its  course  which  is  straighter. 

The  water  of  the  mills  ought  to  strike  the  blades  of  the  wheels  at 
right  angles. 

That  water  which  flows  with  less  slant  will  strike  the  wheel  farther 
from  the  perpendicular  of  its  fall. 

That  water  which  strikes  farther  from  the  perpendicular  of  its  fall 
gives  a  less  blow.  h  30  v. 

The  wave  created  by  the  percussion  of  water  upon  the  bed  of  a  river 
will  make  a  movement  from  below  contrary  to  that  from  above. 

The  wave  is  slower  at  the  end  of  its  elevation  than  at  any  other  part. 

The  parts  of  the  wave  which  move  most  swiftly  will  be  near  the  end 
of  its  fall. 

The  sand  remains  higher  underneath  the  highest  part  of  the  wave 
than  under  its  lower  part.  h  31  r. 

When  a  stone  is  thrown  into  still  water  it  will  create  ripples  that 
expand  equally  if  the  water  is  of  uniform  depth. 

If  two  stones  are  thrown  one  near  to  the  other  within  the  space  of  a 
braccio,  the  circles  of  the  water  will  increase  equally  one  within  the 
other  without  the  one  destroying  the  other. 

But  if  the  bottom  is  not  level  the  circles  will  not  expand  in  uniform 
movement  except  on  the  surface. 

When  an  object  of  long  shape  is  thrown  into  water  it  will  create  an 
oval  undulation. 


704  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

A  round  object  thrown  into  running  water  will  create  an  oval  undu- 
lation in  two  movements.  h  31  v. 

Where  the  water  is  higher  it  has  more  weight  upon  its  bed  and  its 
course  is  more  undulating. 

That  part  of  the  bed  or  of  the  bank  which  projects  with  the  sharpest 
angles  into  the  straight  course  of  the  waters  suffers  most  damage  in  the 
flow  of  the  water.  h  35  v. 

Water  which  strikes  on  an  angle  deepens  the  former  sides,  h  36  r. 

Every  part  of  the  surface  of  the  water  desires  to  be  situated  at  an 
equal  distance  from  the  centre  of  the  elements,  and  if  one  part  of  the 
surface  be  raised  above  another  this  so  happens  because  of  the  contrary 
movements  which  are  taking  place  between  it  and  the  bottom.

Where  the  current  is  in  the  centre  of  the  full  stream  the  ridge  will 
not  be  between  the  point  of  union  of  the  eddies  and  of  where  the  water 
rebounds;  it  is  all  deep. 

The  large  pebbles  remain  in  the  deepest  part  of  the  current.

THE   NATURE  OF   WATER  705 

When  a  long  object  moves  in  a  channel  midway  between  the  middle 
and  the  contact  of  the  bank  it  will  move  slantwise. 

The  long  object  which  is  nearer  to  the  side  than  to  the  centre  will 
proceed  to  revolve  upon  the  water.  h  47  r. 

Where  water  has  less  movement  there  it  deposits  its  weight  more 
lightly. 

The  eddies  of  water  after  it  has  struck  the  ground  at  an  angle  turn 
in  contrary  movement.  h  47  v. 

Water  will  be  in  perpetual  movement  if  its  surface  is  not  equidistant 
from  the  centre  of  the  earth. 

Sand  and  other  light  objects  follow  and  obey  the  twists  and  turns  of 
the  eddies  of  the  water  while  the  large  stones  move  in  a  straight  line. 

h  50  [2]  r. 

Water  which  falls  into  smooth  water  causes  it  to  become  slanting, 
consequently  its  descent  becomes  swifter.  h  50  [2]  v. 

Measure  the  height  of  the  falling  water  and  multiply  it  by  the  height 
to  which  you  wish  to  raise  it,  and  as  many  times  as  the  extent  of  the 
fall  of  the  water  enters  into  the  height  to  which  it  has  been  raised,  so 
many  times  is  it  thinner  than  that  which  rises;  and  this  is  the  last  and 
greatest  amount  that  can  be  raised.  h  51  [3]  v. 

Water  which  rises  continually  because  of  the  movement  of  other 
water  will  be  so  much  the  thinner  as  that  which  moves  it  is  of  greater 
length.  h  52  [4]  r. 

Turbid  water  does  more  harm  to  the  banks  than  clear  water,  and 
more  at  the  base  than  at  the  top,  because  it  is  heavier  and  thicker. 

h  52  [4]  v. 

The  line  of  the  water  which  has  the  greater  movement  breaks  that 
of  the  lesser  movement  and  buries  itself  beneath  it. 

That  part  of  the  sand  which  is  nearest  to  the  impact  of  the  falling 
water  will  be  finer  than  the  rest. 

The  large  shingle  will  be  farthest  away  from  the  blow,  h  53  [5]  r. 

I  ask  whether  the  water  which  emerges  underneath  comes  from  the 
surface  or  no. 


yo6  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

The  first  depth  will  be  where  the  sum  of  the  blow  of  the  second 
water  makes  its  way  into  the  course  of  the  eddies;  the  lesser  where  the 
second  base  is,  is  where  the  revolving  water  encounters  it  in  its  course. 

h  53  [5]  v. 

After  the  descent  of  water  that  which  was  above  remains  below;  the 
lower  part  becomes  changed  into  the  upper  part. 

After  the  most  rapid  descent  of  the  water  the  lower  part  remains  of 
more  rapid  movement  than  the  upper  part.  h  54  [6]  r. 

Of  waters  that  flow  upon  beds  of  equal  slant  that  will  have  the  less 
depth  which  has  the  greater  breadth. 

Of  waters  that  flow  between  banks  of  equal  breadth  that  will  have 
less  depth  which  possesses  the  more  rapid  course.  h  54  [6]  v. 

Water  in  its  movement  drags  with  it  the  air  which  borders  on  it. 

And  the  bed  offers  more  resistance :  this  is  why  it  moves  more  on  the 
surface  than  at  the  bottom. 

All  the  upper  part  of  the  water  which  finds  itself  at  the  beginning 
of  its  fall  will  be  lower  than  the  other  after  this  fall.  h  55  [7]  r. 

Water  which  flows  in  falls  of  equal  slant  will  move  more  strongly  at 
the  bottom  of  the  canal  than  at  its  surface.  h  56  [8]  v. 

Waters  which  fall  from  the  same  level  with  an  equal  slant  in  an 
equal  length  of  movement  will  be  of  equal  swiftness,      h  58  [10]  v. 

Of  waters  which  fall  from  the  same  level  by  channels  of  equal  slant, 
that  will  have  the  swifter  course  which  has  the  greater  length. 

Of  waters  which  fall  the  same  distance  from  the  same  level,  that 
will  be  slower  which  is  longer.  h  59  [n]  r. 

The  percussion  of  the  water  upon  the  wheel  will  be  at  the  highest 
degree  of  its  power  when  it  strikes  within  equal  angles. 

The  percussion  made  between  equal  angles  will  be  of  the  greatest 
power  when  the  current  of  the  water  and  the  movement  of  the  wheel 
are  in  the  same  direction.  h  63  [15]  r. 

The  sand  moved  by  two  light  currents  of  water  settles  itself  upon 
the  steep  bank  in  a  square  ridge.  h  63  [15]  v. 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  707 

Water  which  has  struck  against  a  round  body  will  create  equal 
hollows  beyond  the  sides  of  this  body. 

Gravel  dug  up  by  the  blows  of  the  water  will  settle  where  the  move- 
ments made  by  the  blows  meet. 

That  face  of  the  triangle  which  is  interposed  between  more  nearly 
equal  angles  in  the  course  of  the  water  will  be  the  cause  of  a  great 
hollow  in  the  water  that  strikes  there.  h  64  [16]  r. 

Water  which  moves  by  a  uniform  slant  will  be  swifter  at  the  surface 
than  at  the  bottom. 

The  wave  that  is  caused  by  a  blow  will  be  higher  at  the  beginning 
than  in  the  middle. 

Waves  that  are  caused  by  the  wind  will  be  higher  in  the  middle 
than  at  the  beginning;  that  is  the  fourth  [will  be  higher]  than  the 
third.  h  67  [19]  v. 

These  back-currents  eat  away  the  banks  of  the  canals;  you  will 
therefore  make  screens  of  wood  to  extend  for  the  whole  of  their  im- 
pact, h  68  [20]  r. 

[Movement  of  water] 

Water  which  exceeds  the  general  depth  and  breadth  of  rivers  moves 
in  contrary  movement. 

The  wave  of  the  water  will  swell  between  the  cause  of  the  move- 
ment and  its  end. 

Water  which  moves  by  reason  of  the  undulation  of  the  wind  will 
make  a  contrary  movement  at  the  bottom  to  that  at  the  surface. 

Water  does  not  weigh  less  crosswise  than  in  the  line  of  its  per- 
pendicular. 

Every  movement  of  liquid  weighs  more  in  the  direction  in  which 
through  a  hole  of  equal  size  its  vase  empties  itself  more  rapidly;  the 
centre  of  the  bottom  of  the  vase  receives  a  greater  weight  of  water 
than  any  other  place.  h  68  [20]  v. 

The  free  movement  made  by  the  upper  part  of  water  will  not  make 
angles  of  any  kind  except  in  the  percussion. 
All  the  upper  lines  made  by  the  movement  of  water  are  curved. 
The  wave  follows  the  movement  of  the  air  which  touches  it. 


7o8  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

The  object  enclosed  between  the  air  and  the  wave  does  not  follow 
the  movement  of  the  one  or  the  other. 

The  water  that  is  expelled  from  the  spot  which  the  vessel  occupies 
weighs  as  much  as  all  the  remainder  of  the  ship  which  displaces  it. 

h  69  [21]  r. 

Streams  of  water  equal  in  current  and  angle  of  descent  which  move 
one  against  the  other,  penetrate  and  pass  through  each  other  without 
turning  aside  from  their  natural  course.  h  69  [21]  v. 

Water  which  moves  against  motionless  water  attacks  and  destroys  its 
bank. 

The  water  with  the  greater  movement  penetrates  and  traverses  the 
lesser  movement  of  other  water,  like  air.  h  70  [22]  r. 

The  line  made  by  the  course  of  water  after  its  percussion  leaps  back 
at  equal  angles.  h  71  [23]  r. 

The  farther  water  is  away  from  its  bed  the  freer  will  it  be  in  it? 
natural  movement.  h  72  [24]  r. 

Where  the  water  has  a  stronger  current  the  shingle  is  larger.  All 
the  detached  shingle  will  turn  its  largest  side  slantwise  against  the 
course  of  the  water.  h  74  [26]  v. 

All  light  things  gather  together  in  the  centre  of  the  eddies  that  is  at 
the  bottom.  h  75  [27]  r. 

Every  portion  of  water  desires  its  parts  to  be  as  the  whole  element, 
equally  distant  from  its  centre.  h  76  [28]  r. 

The  water  which  flows  near  the  bed  of  the  stream  between  the  banks 
will  be  slower  than  the  rest  because  of  the  percussions  made  by  the 
eddies.  h  77  [29]  v. 

[Error  as  to  buying  water] 

You  who  buy  water  by  the  ounce  know  that  you  may  greatly  deceive 
yourselves.  In  fact  if  you  take  an  ounce  in  stagnant  water  and  an 
ounce  in  flowing  water,  against  the  hole  of  your  ounce,  an  ounce  near 
the  surface,  one  near  the  bottom,  one  across  the  current  .  .  . 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  705 

In  proportion  as  the  natural  movement  separates  itself  from  its  cause 
so  it  becomes  more  rapid.  h  78  [30]  r. 

That  wheel  of  the  water  will  be  better  turned  when  the  water  that 
turns  it  does  not  leap  back  after  its  percussion. 

The  blow  will  be  of  the  greatest  force  when  the  movement  which 
causes  it  is  straighter  and  longer.  h  79  [31]  v. 

[Sand  and  water] 

All  the  hollows  of  the  furrows  visible  in  the  sand  will  be  between 
equal  angles,  according  to  the  movement  of  the  water,   h  80  [32]  r. 

OF  SAND 

The  wave  is  less  sloping  and  of  slower  movement  in  its  rise  than  in 
its  descent.  h  81  [33]  r. 

The  surface  of  the  water  of  rivers  desires  to  be  equidistant  from  the 
centre;  as  it  leaps  it  weighs  down  and  consumes  the  bed  because  it 
grows  thicker  in  the  course  of  its  intersections  and  increases  in  weight 
as  it  enters  the  air,  and  in  consequence  falls  and  bursts  through  the 
bed.  h  81   [33]  v.  and  82  [34]  r. 

In  water  that  has  no  movement  the  leaves  that  ranged  through  every 
part  of  the  water  rest  upon  its  bed.  h  82  [34]  r. 

The  back-currents  which  are  formed  in  the  midst  of  the  expanse 
of  the  falling  water  are  situated  between  the  leap  of  the  water  and 
its  banks.  h  82  [34]  r. 

The  back-currents  made  by  the  water  after  the  expense  of  its  fall  will 
be  between  the  surface  and  the  bottom,  between  the  upper  and  the 
lower  part.  h  83  [35]  r. 

If  the  beds  of  two  canals  are  of  equal  slant  and  breadth,  and  contain 
an  equal  volume  of  water,  and  one  is  restricted  to  two  thirds  of  its 
breadth  in  the  middle  of  its  course  and  the  other  is  uniform  in  breadth, 
I  ask  which  will  discharge  more  water. 

Water  that  falls  into  other  water  strikes  against  its  bed  and  raises 
itself  farther  in  the  air  than  does  the  general  surface,  and  then  falls 
back  and  lessens  its  bounds.  h  83  [35]  v. 


710  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

The  lines  of  the  water  as  it  leaps  after  its  percussion  will  not  be  in  a 
straight  course  but  will  bend  in  a  curve.  h  84  [36]  r. 

A  straight  canal  of  uniform  depth  and  slant  will  make  within  a 
short  time  a  deeper  hollow  in  its  centre  than  near  the  bank. 

The  water  in  the  middle  of  straight  canals  flows  more  rapidly  than 
it  does  at  the  sides. 

Where  the  water  has  more  movement  it  is  lighter  if  it  is  of  the  same 
height. 

Water  which  has  been  pent  up  will  burst  the  bank  and  the  bottom 
after  its  fall.  h  84  [36]  v. 

Every  canal  of  water  of  uniform  declivity,  depth  and  breadth,  which 
is  pent  up  for  a  certain  space,  will  burst  its  bed  and  its  bank  after  the 
passage  of  this  restricted  area. 

This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  where  water  is  pent  up  it  rises  behind  this 
barrier  and  after  passing  through  this  narrow  place  it  presses  on  furi- 
ously; as  it  descends  it  comes  upon  the  water  below  which  does  not 
flow  and  so  it  receives  a  check.  After  this  it  follows  the  line  of  its 
descent  and  goes  to  the  bottom  and  burrows  there  and  turns  with  a 
circular  movement  towards  the  banks,  and  hollowing  these  out  from 
below  it  makes  them  fall  in  ruin,  as  is  shown  in  the  drawing  above. 

h  85  [37]  r. 
[With  drawing] 

Water  below  obeys  its  natural  course  less  than  that  above. 

This  comes  about  because  the  water  that  borders  on  the  air  is  not 
made  heavy  by  any  weight,  so  that  simply  and  without  any  restraint  it 
obeys  its  natural  course  c  d. 

That  below  is  weighted  and  pressed  and  acts  as  is  shown  at  a  b.  See 
that  as  it  forms  an  angle  at  a  and  above  at  c  it  cannot  form  anything 
but  a  curved  line. 

All  the  waters  some  distance  below  the  surface  intersect  after  their 
percussion.  h  85  [37]  v. 

That  water  will  turn  in  contrary  course  which  exceeds  the  general 
breadth  and  depth  of  the  rivers. 

Waters  of  equal  breadth  and  unequal  depth  will  be  of  equal  move- 
ment on  the  surface. 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  711 

Among  the  currents  of  water  of  equal  slant  that  which  is  the 
straightest  will  be  the  swiftest.  h  87  [39  J  r. 

Water  which  exceeds  in  depth  or  breadth  the  general  breadth  and 
depth  of  the  river  will  turn  against  its  first  course.  h  87  [39J  v. 

[Method] 

Remember  when  discoursing  about  water  to  adduce  first  experience 
and  then  reason.  h  90  [42]  r. 

Of  streams  of  water  equal  in  length,  breadth  and  declivity,  the 
swiftest  will  be  the  one  of  greatest  depth.  h  92  [44]  v. 

All  the  movements  of  streams  of  water  which  are  equal  in  depth 
and  declivity  will  be  more  swift  at  the  surface  than  at  the  bottom,  and 
more  at  the  centre  than  at  the  sides.  h  93  [45]  r. 

Water,  which  is  the  vital  humour  of  the  terrestrial  machine,  moves 
by  its  own  natural  heat.  h  95  [47  v.]  r. 

[The  circulation  of  water] 

The  water  which  from  the  lowest  depths  of  the  sea  entering  by  the 
force  of  its  mover  is  driven  to  the  high  summits  of  the  mountains,  there 
finding  the  severed  veins,  hurls  itself  headlong  and  returns  by  the 
shortest  way  to  the  depths  of  the  sea;  and  again  it  raises  itself  through 
the  ramification  o£  its  veins  and  again  falls  back,  and  thus,  coming  and 
going,  sometimes  high  and  sometimes  low,  inwards  and  outwards,  it 
revolves  with  natural  or  accidental  movement  after  the  manner  of  a 
screw,  while  the  water  that  is  poured  away  through  its  severed  branches 
and  falls  back  upon  itself  rises  again  through  its  courses  and  returns  to 
the  same  points  of  descent.  h  ioi  [42  r.]  v. 

Where  three  currents  of  water  meet  together  there  will  be  created  a 
sudden  depth,  for  they  rise  and  acquire  weight  and  then  movement 
with  force,  and  this  breaks  in  the  percussion  that  it  makes  upon  the 
bottom.  1    61  [13]  v. 

[Of  the  fall  of  a  river] 

If  the  bottom  of  the  bed  of  the  river  from  which  the  water  hurls 
itself  is  hollow  in  the  centre,  the  water  which  moves  from  the  sides  and 
directs  itself  towards  this  centre  will  raise  itself  before  falling. 


7i2  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

If  the  river  as  it  flows  strikes  against  some  rock,  it  will  leap  up,  and 
the  place  that  it  strikes  in  its  fall  will  be  of  the  nature  of  a  well. 

i    62  [14]  r. 

If  the  rock  in  a  river  projects  above  and  divides  the  course  of  the 
water  which  rejoins  after  this  rock,  the  interval  that  is  found  to  exist 
between  the  rock  and  the  reunion  of  the  water  will  be  the  place  where 
the  sand  becomes  deposited. 

But  if  the  rock  that  divides  the  course  of  the  waters  is  covered  by  the 
flowing  waters  only  in  its  lower  parts,  the  water  that  passes  above  will 
fall  behind  it  and  form  a  hollow  at  its  feet  and  cause  it  to  turn;  and  the 
water  that  falls  headlong  into  this  chasm  turns  in  vortex  upwards  and 
downwards,  for  the  uniting  of  the  two  streams  of  water  which  had 
been  divided  by  the  rock  does  not  suffer  the  water  immediately  to 
pursue  its  journey.  1  67  [19]  v. 

Every  natural  and  continuous  movement  desires  to  preserve  its 
course  on  the  line  of  its  inception,  that  is  however  its  locality  varies  it 
proceeds  according  to  its  beginning. 

This  movement  aforesaid  occurs  in  the  course  of  rivers,  which  always 
attack  and  destroy  whatever  opposes  the  direct  line  of  their  course. 

But  if  these  rivers  were  straight,  with  equal  breadth,  depth  and  slant, 
you  would  find  that  with  each  degree  of  movement  they  would  acquire 
degrees  of  speed. 

Consequently  if  there  is  a  change  or  difference  in  their  slant  there 
is  a  difference  in  their  course;  and  where  there  is  less  inequality  in 
breadth  they  become  deeper;  and  given  an  equal  slant,  where  they  are 
wider  they  become  slower.  Therefore  the  waters  which  desire  a  straight 
course,  and  to  make  themselves  swifter  at  each  stage  of  their  move- 
ment, finding  the  places  through  which  they  pass  wider  and  deeper 
become  slower  and  break  the  bed  or  the  bank.  1  68  [20]  r. 


WATER  AND  AIR 

The  movement  of  the  rebound  of  water  is  swifter  than  that  of  the 
percussion  when  the  water  that  strikes  is  much  mingled  with  the  air. 

1  68  [20]  v. 


THE   NATURE  OF   WATER  713 

For  the  air  is  capable  of  being  compressed,  and  the  more  it  is  com- 
pressed the  more  it  has  weight  within  the  other  air;  and  the  greater  its 
weight  the  greater  its  percussion  against  its  object,  as  is  seen  with  the 
winds  which  are  constrained  from  great  breadth  to  pass  through  a  nar- 
row defile  of  the  mountains :  if  there  were  no  opening  above  them  they 
would  not  fill  up  the  spaces  of  the  things  in  front  of  them,  but  they  are 
able  to  expand  above  with  great  facility  because  there  are  great  spaces 
between  the  hills  .  .  .  and  below  readily,  and  the  wind  flies  easily 
towards  the  height.  Remember  how  Augustus  made  a  vow  in  Gaul  to 
the  wind  Cirrius  because  for  just  such  an  impetus  he  had  to  lose  his 
army,  and  there  he  made  a  temple.  1  68  [20]  v.,  69  [21]  r.  and  v. 

Water  will  leap  up  far  higher  than  it  has  fallen,  through  the  violent 
movement  caused  by  the  air  which  finds  itself  shut  in  within  the 
bubbles  of  the  water,  and  which  afterwards  rises  and  floats  like  bells 
upon  the  surface  of  the  water.  Returning  to  the  place  where  it  strikes, 
the  water  is  again  submerged  by  the  blow,  so  that  the  air  finds  itself 
hemmed  in  between  the  water  which  drives  it  down  and  that  which 
encounters  it,  and  being  pressed  upon  with  such  fury  and  violence 
suddenly  bursts  through  the  water  which  serves  it  as  a  covering,  and 
like  a  thunderbolt  emerging  from  the  clouds  so  this  air  emerges  from 
the  water  carrying  with  it  a  part  of  the  water1  which  previously  formed 
its  covering.  1  69  [21]  v. 

[Water  in  canals] 

When  water  in  some  part  of  its  passage  through  a  narrow  canal 
becomes  wider  it  immediately  becomes  shallow  and  swifter  because  it 
finds  a  slope  where  it  moves  vigorously.  And  along  the  course  it  has 
commenced  it  directs  itself  to  the  foot  of  its  dike  and  strikes  it. 

After  which  percussion  it  turns  upwards  and  proceeds  with  a  whirl- 
ing movement  hollowing  out  the  foundation  of  the  bank  until  it 
returns  upwards.  And  this  process  of  hollowing  it  out  gives  it  the  shape 
of  the  hull  of  a  ship,  narrow  at  the  commencement  and  the  end  and  in 
the  centre  deep  and  wide.  1    70  [22]  r.

the  higher  eddies.  And  it  may  be  asked  whether  the  movement  of  the 
eddies  starts  because  it  runs  towards  the  percussion  of  the  water,  which 
is  lower  than  in  any  other  adjacent  part;  or  because  the  thrust  of  the 
water  that  flows  in  the  centre  of  the  breadth  of  the  surface  is  that  which 
as  it  strikes  the  other  waters  raises  them  and  makes  a  hill  with  the 
other  water,  and  then  returns  towards  its  entry  in  the  expanse  of  water; 
or  if  the  water  struck  by  the  other  waters  in  its  stream  and  pressed  by 
it  gushes  up  and  leaps  back  to  the  place  from  which  the  current  comes.

BEGINNING  OF  THE  BOOK  OF  WATER 

The  name  pelago  (sea,  large  lake)  is  applied  to  an  area  large  and 
deep  in  form  in  which  the  waters  lie  with  little  movement.  Gorgo 
(whirlpool)  is  of  the  same  nature  as  the  pelago  except  for  a  certain 
difference,  and  this  is  that  the  waters  that  enter  into  the  pelago  do  so 
without  percussions  while  those  of  the  gorgo  are  made  up  of  great 
falls  and  bubblings  up  and  surgings  occasioned  by  the  continuous 
revolutions  of  the  waters.  Fiume  (river)  is  that  which  occupies  the 
site  of  the  lowest  part  of  the  valleys  and  which  flows  continuously.  A 
torrent  is  that  which  flows  only  with  rains :  it  also  makes  its  way  in  the 
low  parts  of  the  valleys  and  joins  itself  to  the  rivers. 

Canal  is  the  term  applied  to  waters  regulated  within  their  banks  by 
human  aid.  Fonti  (sources)  is  the  name  given  to  the  birthplaces  of 
rivers.  Argine  (bank)  is  that  which  with  its  abrupt  height  withstands 
the  widening  of  rivers  canals  and  torrents.  The  ripa  (bank)  is  higher 
than  the  argine.  The  riva  (shore)  is  lower  than  the  argine.  The 
spiaggia  (beach)  is  among  the  lowest  of  the  parts  which  form  bounda- 
ries with  the  waters.  Lago  (lake)  is  that  in  which  the  waters  of  the 
rivers  assume  great  width.  Paludi  (marshes)  are  stagnant  waters. 
Grotte  (caves)  are  hollows  formed  in  the  banks  of  rivers  by  the  course 
of  the  river;  their  length  follows  the  line  of  the  course  of  the  water; 
they  have  some  depth  and  also  find  their  way  under  the  foundations  of 
the  bank,  losing  their  shape  as  they  near  the  end  of  their  course. 
Caverns  are  of  the  shape  of  ovens  which  enter  far  beneath  the  bank, 
and  the  waters  in  them  are  in  a  state  of  wild  turmoil  and  are  constantly 
increasing. 

Pozzi  (wells)  are  the  sudden  depths  of  rivers.  Stagni  (pools)  are  the 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  715 

places  of  refuge  for  the  waters  of  floods  or  storms,  their  beds  being  firm 
and  duck  SO  that  the  soil  can  neither  drink  in  nor  dry  up  these  waters. 
Baratri  (chasms)  are  also  places  where  the  water  suddenly  becomes 
deep.  Procelle  (storms)  are  tempests  of  water.  Polulamenti  e  surgimenti 
(bubblings  and  wellings  up)  are  the  beginnings  of  the  waters;  but  the 
former  come  from  below  upwards  and  the  latter  merely  in  transverse 
movement  which  falls  from  some  grotto.  Sommergere  (submersion)  is 
understood  to  refer  to  things  which  enter  under  the  water;  inter  segati- 
one  d acqiie  (intersection  of  waters)  takes  place  when  one  river  cuts 
the  other.1  1    72  [24l  r-  and  v- 

When  the  general  courses  of  the  rivers  are  contracted,  as  they  issue 
from  the  valleys  and  enter  amid  the  defiles  of  the  mountains,  the  water 
will  heap  itself  up  in  its  wide  part;  and  it  will  make  great  descent  and 
movement  through  the  said  contracting  of  the  mountains,  and  after 
passing  the  middle  of  this  contracted  part  it  will  make  a  great  hollow, 
and  then  having  entered  again  in  the  broad  part  it  will  lack  depth,  in 
just  such  proportion  as  the  wide  part  increases  in  such  a  way  that  the 
waters  become  of  equal  course. 

And  the  said  depth  will  be  lacking  after  the  leap  of  the  waters,  be- 
cause it  will  become  filled  up  with  shingle  beneath  the  greater  altitude 
of  the  leap  of  the  said  waters. 

If  the  fall  is  of  the  same  width  as  the  river,  the  water  that  strikes  the 
bottom  will  leap  up  and  then  fall  back  again  by  each  line  that  departs 
from  the  centre  of  the  surging  mass,  and  the  farther  they  descend  from 
this  surging  mass  the  more  they  spread  out.  And  part  is  moved  by  the 
course  of  the  stream,  and  as  a  consequence  it  is  necessary  for  it  to  make 
three  movements,  each  of  which  consumes  a  considerable  portion  of  the 
foot  of  the  bank. 

For  that  which  descends  from  the  summit  of  the  surging  mass 
throws  itself  towards  the  bottom,  and  since  such  descent  is  slanting  it 
acquires  a  movement  towards  the  bottom  of  the  bank;  and  as  this 
descent  follows  in  part  the  general  movement  of  the  river,  this  surging 
mass  falls  with  a  threefold  descending  movement,  one  proceeding 
downwards,  another  towards  the  bank,  another  towards  the  course  of 
the  river.  And  all  three  consume  the  base  of  the  bank,  by  reason  of  the

716  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

great  displacement  occasioned  by  so  much  impetus;  for  if  the  river 
were  to  flow  for  a  long  way  hugging  the  bank  it  would  be  able  to  find 
some  stone  which  at  some  spot  would  protect  a  piece  of  this  bank  near 
to  it;  but  this  movement  proceeds  downward  towards  the  bottom,  for- 
ward towards  the  bank,  downward  towards  the  course  of  the  stream,  in 
such  a  way  that  each  stone  is  struck  by  three  different  movements  and 
on  three  different  sides. 

From  which  it  follows  that  if  the  soil  is  friable  it  crumbles  away 
in  a  short  time.  I    74  O6]  v->  75  [27]  r- 

[Of  the  movement  of  water — bubbles} 

When  one  sees  mountains  rising  in  the  running  waters,  rising  in  the 
form  of  bubbles,  it  serves  as  a  sign  of  the  great  depth  from  which  these 
bubbles  spring  after  the  percussion  made  by  the  water  upon  the  bot- 
tom; and  by  the  speed  of  its  rebound  it  bores  through  and  penetrates 
the  other  water  and  then  turns  towards  the  surface  of  the  running 
water  and  passes  through  it,  rising  up  in  this  way;  thereafter  acquiring 
weight  it  loses  its  first  impetus  and  falls  down  again  by  each  line  round 
its  centre,  and  returns  again  towards  its  bed.  i    76  [28]  v. 

CURRENTS 

Of  the  difference  water  makes  in  its  course  if  its  sides  strike  on  a 
strand,  a  bank,  or  other  water,  that  is  in  passing  by  a  piece  of  stagnant 
water  or  running  water  crosswise. 

One  should  also  observe  what  differences  there  are  in  rivers  if  they 
fall  upon  beds  of  different  natures,  namely  upon  stone  or  earth,  or  tufa 
or  clay,  sand  or  mud,  or  stagnant  or  running  water,  and  this  crosswise 
or  slanting  or  opposite,  or  by  the  same  line  as  the  water  itself,  that  is  by 
the  line  of  the  same  current  but  slower  or  swifter  than  that  which  it 
strikes,  or  more  level  or  more  slanting. 

OF  EDDIES 

One  asks  why  the  percussion  of  water  within  water  makes  lines  of 
circular  movements  and  eddies,  and  its  leap  is  not  straight  as  is  that 
other  which  beats  upon  its  shores  and  banks. 

Why  bubbles  are  not  continuous  when  the  falls  of  the  water  are: 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  717 

The  reason  is  that  the  water  which  flows  above  alter  falling  is  swifter 

than  that  which  flows  below;  and  when  that  below  precipitates  itselt 
in  some  chasm  it  raises  itself  towards  the  surface  with  almost  the  same 
impetus,  and  sometimes  subdues  and  overcomes  the  water  that  flows 
above  and  sometimes  is  subdued  by  it. 

Being  thus  in  a  state  of  equilibrium  as  to  its  power  of  movement 
sometimes  one  conquers  and  sometimes  the  other. 

1    77  [29]  r.  and  v. 

Things  lighter  than  water  do  not  follow  the  course  of  the  rebound 
and  intersection  of  the  water,  but  pass  along  the  centre  of  its  current  or 
near  the  parts  as  they  are  found  at  the  entrance  of  the  currents,  and  are 
not  impeded  unless  by  equal  pressure,  because  if  the  right  wave  of  the 
rebound  meets  with  the  left,  it  is  necessary,  if  they  are  of  equal  power, 
that  the  place  of  their  percussion  be  thrown  back  equally. 

Consequently  things  in  this  place  which  move  upon  the  water,  not 
being  driven  more  by  one  percussion  than  by  the  other  remain  in  the 
same  line  of  current.  But  if  one  of  the  forces  of  the  wave  be  greater 
than  the  other,  that  is  by  the  swiftness  of  its  current,  I  do  not  mean 
force  arising  from  a  greater  quantity  of  water,  for  if  the  one  water  was 
much  less  thick  than  the  other  this  would  not  matter:  for  let  us  sup- 
pose one  body  of  water  to  be  less  than  double  the  other  in  volume  and 
to  acquire  double  its  speed;  now  since  these  bodies  of  water  clashing 
together  are  of  equal  size  in  their  contact,  as  I  have  proved  in  the  third 
of  the  fifth,  the  larger  being  a  square  braccio  and  the  lesser  of  a  half 
braccio,  the  lesser  does  not  strike  the  greater  unless  it  is  in  its  half,  and 
in  the  same  way  the  greater  strikes  the  lesser  with  its  half,  so  that  the 
contacts  made  by  the  percussions  are  equal  in  quantity  and  unequal  in 
that  the  power  is  double,  the  speed  of  the  one  being  double  that  of  the 
other. 

OF  THE  EDDIES 

Sometimes  there  are  many  eddies  which  have  a  great  current  of 
water  in  the  middle  of  them,  and  the  more  they  approach  the  end  of 
the  current  the  greater  they  are.  These  are  created  on  the  surface  by  the 
waters  that  turn  back  after  the  percussion  that  they  make  in  the  most 
rapid  current,  for  the  front  portions  of  these  waters,  being  themselves 


718  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

slow,  on  being  struck  by  the  swift  movement,  are  suddenly  transformed 
into  the  said  speed.  Consequently  the  water  which  touches  them  behind 
is  attached  and  drawn  by  force,  and  torn  away  from  the  other,  so  that  it 
turns  all  in  succession,  one  (wave)  following  the  other  with  a  like 
swiftness  of  movement,  if  it  were  not  that  such  current  at  first  cannot 
receive  it  so  that  at  any  rate  it  does  not  rise  above  it,  and  as  this  cannot 
be  it  is  necessary  for  it  to  turn  back  and  consume  in  itself  these  swift 
movements.  From  that  time  the  said  eddies  with  various  revolving 
movements  proceed  to  consume  the  impetus  that  has  been  begun.  And 
they  do  not  remain  in  the  same  positions,  but  after  they  have  been 
formed  thus,  turning,  they  are  borne  by  the  impetus  of  the  water  in 
the  same  shape,  in  which  they  come  to  make  two  movements;  the  one 
is  made  in  itself  by  its  own  revolution,  the  other  as  it  follows  the  course 
of  the  water  which  is  carrying  it  along  all  the  time  that  it  is  destroy- 
ing it.  i     78   [30]  r.  and  v.,  79  [31]  r. 

[Air  and  water] 

The  water  which  by  a  slight  movement  encloses,  a  little  way  below 
its  surface,  the  air  which  is  submerged  with  it,  turns  with  a  slight 
impetus  out  of  the  surface,  carrying  with  it  such  covering  of  water  that 
being  of  equal  weight  with  this  air  it  stands  above  it  in  the  form  of  a 
half-spherical  figure. 

But  if  this  air  is  submerged  with  impetus  it  comes  back  out  of  the 
water  with  fury  for  the  length  of  the  movement  made  beneath  the 
water;  and  pressed  by  its  weight  it  leaps  out  of  the  water,  breaks  its 
surface  with  its  impetus  and  flows  on  with  straight  course  after  the 
manner  of  wind  emerging  from  bellows  which  discharges  itself  in  a 
stream  through  the  air;  and  therefore  it  does  not,  as  does  the  former  as 
it  floats  upon  the  water,  remain  enveloped  in  its  surface. 

1    80  [32]  v. 

How  all  the  air  which  leaps  back  with  the  water  does  not  remain  on 
the  surface  but  by  its  impetus  submerges  itself  anew  amid  the  revolu- 
tions of  the  waters: 

How  the  movements  of  the  waters  among  the  other  waters  are  not 
obliged  to  move  more  by  a  straight  line  than  a  curved  one,  and  how 
after  leaping  back  as  they  wished  these  waters  are  not  obliged  to  be  at 
rest,  but  in  order  to  return  to  a  low  place  and  with  a  revolving  move-

\Of  water  flowing  into  water] 

BEND  OF  CURRENT 

If  the  entry  of  the  water  into  the  sheet  of  water  (pelago)  is  of  circular 
shape  the  concavity  of  its  base  will  be  of  the  form  of  a  crescent,  receiv-

the  water  strikes  upon  a  bed  of  uniform  substance;  and  I  ask  as  to  the 
shape  the  shingle  will  take  which  is  left  after  the  percussion  of  each  of 
these,  and  the  remedies  when  they  are  injured.  1    82  [34]  r. 

HOW  TO   STRAIGHTEN  RIVERS  WHEN  THEY  HAVE 
A  SLOW  COURSE 

Because  the  straighter  the  river  the  swifter  will  its  course  be,  and  the 
more  vigorously  will  it  gnaw  and  consume  the  bank  and  its  bed,  it  is 
therefore  necessary  either  to  enlarge  these  rivers  considerably  or  to  send 
them  through  many  twistings  and  turnings  or  to  divide  them  into  a 
number  of  branches. 

And  if  the  river  through  many  twistings  and  turnings  becomes  slow 
and  marshy  through  its  many  detours  you  ought  then  to  straighten  it, 
in  such  a  way  that  the  waters  acquire  sufficient  movement  and  do  not 
cause  destruction  to  the  banks  or  dikes;  and  if  there  should  be  depth 
near  to  some  dike  you  ought  to  fill  up  the  spot  with  gabions  together 


720  THE  NATURE  OF   WATER 

with  fascines  and  shingle,  so  that  it  may  not  become  hollowed  out  by 
movement  under  the  dike,  and  so  by  causing  it  to  crumble  the  river 
may  afterwards  proceed  to  make  a  bend  in  your  land  or  villa  and  there 
straighten  its  course.  i     82  [34]  v. 

f  Of  the  earth  carried  by  water] 

When  the  water  in  the  floods  commences  to  find  a  place  where  it 
can  flow,  it  begins  with  its  feeble  inundation  to  strip  and  carry  away 
the  lightest  things,  and  deposits  them  where  its  course  becomes  feeble, 
then  as  it  grows  it  carries  away  the  heavier  things  such  as  sand,  and 
carries  them  over  the  former  things  and  there  leaves  them,  and  even 
though  the  water  should  not  increase,  by  the  mere  fact  of  its  continu- 
ance it  proceeds  by  degrees  to  carry  away  the  things  from  the  place 
where  it  flows;  but  by  reason  of  their  weight  it  cannot  carry  them  so 
far  forward  as  the  first  lighter  things,  and  if  it  then  carries  away  the 
heavier  things  it  deposits  them  proportionately  near  to  the  spot  from 
whence  it  took  them. 

How  to  restore  the  soil  to  the  places  that  have  been  uncovered  and 
stripped  bare  by  the  courses  of  the  waters  on  a  hill  or  mountain  or  in 
sandy  places. 

For  the  rains,  or  to  provide  an  outlet  for  other  waters,  one  ought  to 
construct  canals  or  mouths  of  rivers,  for  the  places  where  they  pass  in 
so  great  current  that  they  tend  to  become  turbid  by  reason  of  the  earth 
they  carry  with  them  and  to  be  changed;  then  when  they  are  at  the 
place  where  you  wish  that  they  rid  themselves  of  the  soil,  these  canals 
of  water  are  divided  into  many  small  channels  of  water,  after  the  man- 
ner of  furrows,  and  their  violence  is  lessened  and  they  grow  clear  again. 

1    83  [35]  r. 
[Of  flowing  water] 

Where  the  river  is  constricted,  it  will  have  its  bed  stripped  bare  of 
earth,  and  the  stones  or  tufa  will  remain  uncovered  by  the  soil. 

Where  the  river  widens,  the  small  stones  and  the  sand  will  be 
deposited. 

Where  the  river  widens  considerably,  there  will  be  discharged  the 
mud  or  the  ooze  and  bits  of  timber  and  other  light  things. 

Where  several  currents  of  water  run  together,  there  will  instantly  be 
formed  a  hollow  that  will  be  navigable. 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  721 

Where  the  waters  separate,  the  sand  and  ooze  will  be  deposited  and 

the  bed  will  be  raised  in  the  shape  of  the  halt  oi  a  ship  inverted. 

Beneath  the  rebounds  of  the  water,  there  will  be  formed  hills  of  sand 
or  stones. 

Beneath  the  repercussions,  that  which  rests  under  the  rebound  will 
become  raised. 

Where  the  water  finds  the  place  higher,  which  forms  an  obstacle 
beneath  it,  it  makes  a  greater  and  higher  wave  and  then  forms  a  deeper 
hollow.  1     83  [35]  v. 

Where  you  find  much  sand  you  will  find  at  the  end  of  it  in  front  or 
behind  shingle  or  bare  tufa. 

Sand  is  discharged  when  waters  meet  in  their  course,  for  in  such  a 
spot  nothing  can  remain  that  offers  resistance  to  a  current  so  reinforced; 
light  waves  drop  their  sand  at  the  sides  of  the  said  current,  and  the 
sand  as  the  current  becomes  less  swift  forms  a  cover  to  the  shingle. 

Sometimes  the  lesser  floods  carry  branches  covered  with  leaves  from 
the  plains  and  deposit  them  in  their  small  movements,  and  then, 
becoming  stronger,  heap  sand  upon  the  edges  of  these  branches  and  still 
increasing  carry  there  shingle  and  tall  large  stones.         1     84  [36]   r. 

[The  rebounds  of  water] 

The  rebounds  that  water  makes  which  rise  through  the  percussion 
of  water  which  has  fallen  upon  other  water,  are  not  carried  between  the 
equal  angles  of  its  percussion,  but  will  leap  to  the  surface  by  the  shortest 
way,  through  the  air  that  was  submerged  together  with  the  water. 

1     84   [36]  v. 

If  a  stone  is  thrown  into  still  water  it  will  form  circles  equidistant 
from  their  centre;  but  if  into  a  moving  river  the  circles  formed  will 
lengthen  out  and  be  almost  oval  in  shape,  and  will  travel  on  together 
with  their  centre  away  from  the  spot  where  it  was  first  made,  following 
the  course  of  the  [stream]  ...  1    87  [39]  r. 

OF  WAVES 

The  waves  are  of  [twelve]  kinds,  of  which  the  first  is  made  in  the 
upper  parts  of  the  waters;  the  second  is  made  above  and  below  by  the 
same  path;  the  third  is  made  above  and  below  by  contrary  paths,  and  is 


722  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

not  in  the  centre;  the  fourth  is  made  so  that  from  its  centre  upwards  it 
runs  in  one  direction  and  from  this  centre  downwards  it  makes  the 
opposite  movement;  the  fifth  flows  downwards  and  not  upwards;  the 
sixth  flows  downwards  and  above  has  a  contrary  movement;  the 
seventh  is  that  of  the  submersions  of  waters  by  means  of  a  spring  that 
enters  into  the  earth;  the  eighth  is  that  of  the  submersions  by  means  of 
eddies  which  are  narrow  above  and  wide  below;  the  ninth  is  that  of  the 
eddies  wide  at  the  surface  and  narrow  at  the  base;  the  tenth  is  of  cylin- 
drical eddies;  the  eleventh  of  eddies  that  bend  in  regular  curves1;  the 
twelfth  is  of  the  slanting  eddies.  Make  here  all  the  waves  together,  and 
all  the  movements  by  themselves,  and  all  the  eddies  by  themselves. 
Arrange  thus  the  series  in  order  separated  one  from  the  other.  And  so 
also  the  rebounds  of  how  many  kinds  they  are  in  themselves  and  also 
the  falls.  And  set  down  the  differences  that  there  are  in  turbid  waters, 
in  their  movements  and  percussions,  and  those  that  are  clear;  and 
similarly  in  waters  that  are  violent  and  those  that  are  sluggish;  in  those 
that  are  swollen  and  those  that  are  shallow;  and  between  the  fury  of 
pent-up  rivers  and  those  with  a  wide  course;  and  of  those  that  run  over 
great  stones  or  small  ones  or  sand  or  tufa;  and  of  those  that  fall  from  a 
height  striking  upon  different  stones  with  various  leaps  and  bounds, 
and  of  those  that  fall  by  a  straight  path  touching  and  resting  upon  a 
level  bed;  and  of  those  that  fall  from  a  great  height  alone  through  the 
air;  and  of  those  that  fall  through  the  air  in  shapes  that  are  round  or 
thin  or  wide  or  separated  or  united.  And  then  write  down  the  natures 
of  all  the  percussions :  on  the  surface,  in  the  centre,  and  at  the  bottom, 
and  of  their  different  slants,  and  the  different  natures  of  the  objects  and 
different  shapes  of  the  objects. 

And  if  you  give  movement  to  a  sheet  of  water,  whether  by  opening 
its  sluices  above,  or  in  the  middle,  or  below,  show  the  differences  that 
are  caused  by  it  falling  or  moving  on  the  surface,  and  what  effect  it 
makes  in  entering  with  such  fall  upon  the  ground  or  in  stagnant  water, 
and  how  that  by  which  it  is  moved  at  first  maintains  itself  in  a  channel 
level  or  uneven,  and  how  it  produces  all  at  once  eddies  and  their  re- 
cesses, as  one  sees  in  the  basins  of  Milan,  and  the  nature  of  the  sudden 
rush  of  the  rivers,  and  so  also  with  those  that  grow  little  by  little;  of 
die  waters  also  that  cannot  in  the  great  floods  pass  through  the  arches

THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  713 

of  the  bridges  which  surmount  them,  and  how  the  water  that  passes 
through  these  arches  increases  the  impetus  through  having  a  great 
weight  above.  87   [39]  v->  88   I-H   r-  and  v- 

[The  water  of  mills] 

I  ask  whether  if  the  impetus  of  the  waters  that  turn  the  mills  creates 
a  protuberance  either  across  above  or  below  near  the  place  of  percus- 
sion, this  percussion  will  have  the  same  force  as  if  this  water  ran  in  a 
straight  line.  1     89  [41]   r. 

OF  WATER 

Rivers  when  straight  flow  with  a  much  greater  impetus  in  the  centre 
of  their  breadth  than  they  do  at  their  sides. 

When  the  water  has  struck  on  the  sides  of  rivers  with  equal  percus- 
sion, if  it  find  a  part  of  the  river  narrower  it  will  leap  towards  the 
middle  of  the  river  and  these  waves  will  make  a  new  percussion  be- 
tween themselves;  as  a  consequence  they  will  return  again  towards  the 
banks,  equally,  and  that  water  of  conical  shape,  which  is  enclosed 
between  the  first  percussion  made  upon  the  bank  and  the  second  made 
in  the  centre  of  the  stream,  will  slacken  at  its  base  and  be  swift  near  to 
its  crest.  Striking  the  bottom  they  will  afterwards  rise  equally  to  the 
height  of  the  intersection;  but  always  that  of  the  centre  will  be  swifter 
than  that  which  leaps  back. 

Water  which  moves  along  an  equal  breadth  of  river  and  on  an  equal 
bed  will  have  as  many  different  thicknesses  as  there  are  different  slants 
in  the  bed  where  it  runs;  and  by  as  much  as  it  is  swifter  in  one  place 
than  another  so  proportionately  it  will  be  more  shallow. 

1    105  [57]  v.,  106  [58]  r. 

OF  MOVEMENT 

Water  which  falls  from  the  height  of  a  fathom  will  never  return  to 
the  same  height  except  in  small  drops,  which  will  leap  much  higher 
because  the  motion  of  leaping  back  will  be  much  more  rapid  than  that 
of  the  descents.  In  fact  when  the  water  falls  it  buries  with  it  a  great 
quantity  of  air,  and  after  the  (other)  water  has  been  struck  it  leaps 
back  towards  its  surface  with  a  force  which  creates  a  movement  almost 
as  rapid  as  was  that  of  the  descent;  but  not  actually  so  for  the  reason 


724  THE  NATURE  OF   WATER 

given  in  the  second  of  the  seventh,  where  it  is  stated  that  the  movement 
of  the  rebound  will  never  be  so  swift  as  was  the  descent  of  the  substance 
which  rebounds;  or  thus: — a  succeeding  rebound  will  never  be  equal  to 
that  which  precedes  it.  So  that  in  consequence  the  rebound  which  the 
water  makes  proceeds  from  the  base  where  it  has  been  created,  almost 
with  the  speed  of  the  descent  that  has  given  it  birth;  and  in  addition  to 
this  there  is  added  to  it  a  second  momentum  which  augments  this 
motion,  namely  that  of  the  air  that  is  submerged  by  the  fall  of  the 
water.  This  air  clothed  around  with  water  bounds  up  with  fury  and 
leaps  into  its  element  like  wind  driven  by  the  bellows;  it  carries  with  it 
the  last  of  the  water  which  is  close  to  the  surface,  and  by  such  an  in- 
crease causes  it  to  leap  up  much  farther  than  its  nature  demanded. 

i    108  [60]  v.,  109  [61]  r. 

The  farther  the  circular  wave  is  removed  from  its  cause  the  slower 
will  it  become.  1     114  [66]  r. 

[The  meeting  of  water-courses] 

If  the  courses  of  two  lines  of  water  which  cross  each  other  in  the 
middle  or  in  a  part  of  their  river-beds  pass  either  the  one  into  the  other 
or  the  one  over  the  other,  do  they  then  each  leap  back  after  the  per- 
cussion ?  Certainly  they  leap,  because  it  is  impossible  for  the  two  bodies 
to  pass  one  through  the  other. 

But  after  the  two  bodies  have  clashed  together  they  will  widen 
themselves  at  their  point  of  contact,  and  after  having  struck  they  will 
recoil  to  an  equal  distance  from  the  centre  of  the  percussion.  And  that 
body  which  goes  upwards  follows  its  nature,  and  the  other  body  below 
the  centre  of  the  impact  which  would  wish  to  go  downwards  and 
cannot,  increases  that  above.  1    114  [66]  v. 

EXPERIMENT  OF  THE  REBOUNDS  OF  WATER  IN  A 
LEVEL  CHANNEL 

Make  one  side  of  the  channel  of  glass  and  the  remainder  of  wood; 
and  let  the  water  that  strikes  there  have  millet  or  fragments  of  papyrus 
mixed  in  it,  so  that  one  can  see  the  course  of  the  water  better  from  their 
movements.  And  when  you  have  made  the  experiment  of  these  re- 
bounds fill  the  bed  with  sand  mixed  with  small  shingle;  then  smooth 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  725 

this  bed  and  make  the  water  rebound  upon  it;  and  watch  where  it  rises 
ami  where  it  settles  down. 

Then  make  the  bank  on  the  wooden  side  of  mud,  and  watch  its 
effects  through  the  glass,  and  make  it  again  in  flowing  water. 

1     115  [67]  r. 
[Movements  of  water] 

If  the  water  was  a  quantity  endowed  with  sense  *  as  it  is  a  continuous 
one,  the  movement  that  it  makes  between  the  extreme  elevations  and 
depressions  of  its  waves  would  be  unequal. 

In  effect  the  part  that  rises  acquires  degrees  of  slowness  in  each 
degree  of  movement,  in  such  a  way  that  at  its  greatest  elevation  it  is 


in  the  extreme  stage  of  slowness. 


And  afterwards  in  descending  it  acquires  degrees  of  speed  in  every 
degree  of  movement,  so  that  at  its  lowest  depth  it  acquires  greater 
movement;  therefore  the  resistance  that  ends  its  descent  is  that  which 
receives  the  hurt,  and  that  which  ends  the  height  of  its  elevation  has  no 
hurt. 

But  if  the  quantity  is  continuous :  the  continuous  quantity  has  equal 
movements  when  its  river  is  of  equal  size  and  depth,  because  being  all 
united  together  it  is  necessary  that  in  all  the  parts  of  its  movement  each 
part  draws  and  is  drawn,  pushes  and  is  pushed,  or  drives  and  is  driven. 
And  it  is  necessary  that  this  be  with  equal  movement  and  power;  and 
if  it  were  not  so  the  water  would  multiply  more  where  it  was  slowest 
and  would  fail  where  it  had  most  movement. 

1    115  [6y]  v.,  116  [68]  r. 

Where  the  water  divides  it  rises;  and  afterwards  as  it  falls  down 
again  it  strengthens  its  course  by  the  increased  descent  that  follows. 

Where  the  waters  join  they  rise;  and  then  the  near  movement  that 
follows  becomes  slow.  1    116  [68] 

When  in  the  courses  of  rivers  there  are  two  currents  of  water,  com- 
mencing the  one  far  from  the  other,  which  meet  in  a  place  where  they 
clash  together,  they  will  rise  up  after  this  percussion,  and  their  bed  will 
be  but  little  consumed  because  they  depart  from  it;  and  afterwards  they 
will  fall  back  again  as  they  separate,  and  fall  asunder,  and  falling  back 

1  MS.  disscreta. 


726  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

again  they  will  strike  and  scrape  upon  their  bed.  By  reason  then  of  this 
percussion,  which  beats  and  scrapes  the  bed  with  its  movement,  a  depth 
will  be  produced  there;  and  this  happens  in  the  great  currents  of  rivers. 

i     117   [69]  r. 

[The  height  and  depth  of  the  waves] 

OF  THE  SUMMIT  OF  THE  WAVES 

The  greatest  elevation  of  the  waves  will  not  wear  away  its  bed  be- 
neath itself;  in  effect  it  touches  it  but  little,  by  the  fifth  of  the  sixth 
which  says  that  everything  weighs  by  the  line  of  its  movement;  from 
which  we  may  say  that  this  wave  moves  towards  the  air  that  flies  from 
its  percussion  and  weighs  towards  the  air.  If  however  the  amount  of 
friction  is  slight,  it  will  have  but  little  force  and  will  consume  the  bed 
but  little. 


HOW  WAVES   ATTAIN   THEIR   GREATEST   DEPTH 

Whatever  obstacle  forms  the  chief  cause  in  breaking  the  straight 
course  of  the  water  will  be  most  consumed  and  displaced  by  it. 

Therefore  we  may  say  that  if  the  air  were  the  cause  why  the  straight- 
ness  of  the  elevation  of  the  wave  is  broken  it  would  be  consumed  by 
this  percussion  of  water.  But  this  air  is  not  the  cause  of  the  breaking  of 
such  a  course;  the  only  cause  of  it  is  the  force  which  the  water  acquires 
as  it  emerges  from  its  element.  And  it  would  relax  its  pace  in  such  a 
position  if  it  were  a  sensitive  quantity,  but  being  as  it  is  a  continuous 
quantity  it  is  necessary  that  one  body  of  water  pushes  and  the  other 
draws,  because  they  are  united.  1  117  [69]  v. 

If  the  water  moves  more  swiftly  in  the  falling  of  the  wave  than  in  its 
rising,  and  at  what  point  this  water  delays  most. 

The  water  that  moves  in  the  formation  of  the  waves  will  find  itself 
of  as  great  speed  during  its  ascent  as  that  of  its  descent,  and  it  will  have 
as  much  in  the  middle  of  its  lowest  depth  as  that  of  its  greatest  height. 
And  if  it  was  not  of  equal  movement  it  would  not  be  of  equal  depth  or 
breadth;  and  if  however  it  was  of  equal  length  and  depth  but  not  of 
equal  movement  it  would  form  a  great  height  in  the  place  where  it 
slackened  most.  1     118   [70I  r. 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  727 

The  water  {lows  more  strongly  at  the  sides  of  a  covered  rock  than 
above  it  and  after  it  has  passed  it,  and  for  this  reason  it  twists  the 
waves  made  hv  its  rebounds,  producing  on  its  surface  crescent-shaped 
figures,  1    I23  [75]  r- 

[The  different  sorts  of  rebounds  of  water] 

The  rebounds  of  the  waters  are  of  two  kinds,  that  is  they  are  formed 
from  two  causes;  one  is  that  of  the  lumps  of  the  bed  on  which  the  water 
passes,  the  other  is  when  the  parts  of  the  water  that  strike  against  the 
lumpy  parts  of  the  bank  leap  back  to  the  opposite  bank.  These  masses 
of  water  on  striking  leap  back  to  the  opposite  bank  and  press  and  drive 
themselves  upon  the  first  wave  that  they  meet,  and  swelling  leap 
towards  the  sky;  and  each  flies  equally  from  the  place  where  it  has 
struck,  until  another  wave  drives  it  back  and  afterwards  another  drives 
it  forward. 

So  in  succession  they  fill  the  surface  of  the  rivers  with  a  trellis  pat- 
tern, always  raising  themselves  to  the  positions  of  the  above-mentioned 
percussions.  1    127  [79]  v.

If  you  throw  sawdust  down  into  a  running  stream,  you  will  be  able 
to  observe  where  the  water  turned  upside  down  after  striking  against 
the  banks  throws  this  sawdust  back  towards  the  centre  of  the  stream, 
and  also  the  revolutions  of  the  water  and  where  other  water  either  joins 
it  or  separates  from  it;  and  many  other  things.  Kir.

many  ways  it  hollows  out  the  soil  of  the  banks,  and  the  estates  where

The  eddies  of  water  are  always  produced  in  the  middle  water. 

The  middle  water  is  that  above  the  mouth  of  the  water  which  is  bent 
across  near  to  where  it  runs  into  the  canal. 

The  middle  water  is  that  between  the  water  that  is  falling  and  that

Should  two  streams  of  water  encounter  each  other  and  then  bend 
together  in  the  same  flight,  the  middle  water  will  be  found  bevond  this 
flight  upon  the  current  that  has  less  power. 

The  surface  of  the  water  which  bends  in  leaving  the  straight  line  of 
its  course  for  the  lateral  outlet  will  be  always  higher  in  the  centre  than 
at  the  sides.  k  94  [14]  r.

When  two  streams  of  water  encounter  each  other  and  then  pour

The  water  which  moves  in  a  river  is  either  summoned  or  driven  or 
moves  of  itself.  If  it  is  summoned  or  as  one  may  say  requisitioned 
what  is  it  that  requisitions  it?  If  it  is  driven  what  is  it  that  drives  it?  If 
it  moves  of  itself  this  shows  it  to  have  a  reasoning  power;  but  in  bodies 
which  undergo  continual  change  of  shape  it  is  impossible  that  there 
should  be  reasoning  power,  for  in  these  bodies  there  is  no  judgment.

RIVERS  AND  BANKS 

All  the  embankments  of  rivers  against  which  the  waters  strike  ought 
to  be  so  much  the  more  slanting  as  the  percussion  of  the  water  is  of 
greater  power. 

Water  rises  higher  upon  the  bank  against  which  it  strikes  when  it 
finds  this  bank  more  slanting;  and  consequently  descends  with  greater 
impetus  to  strike  against  the  opposite  bank.  k  102  [22]  v. 

What  difference  there  is  between  the  percussion  of  the  same  quantity 
of  water  when  it  falls  through  the  air  or  falls  shut  up  in  a  conduit : 

The  water  which  falls  in  a  perpendicular  line  becomes  shrill  at 
some  stage  of  its  descent.  When  it  falls  through  a  conduit  this  is  left 
empty,  and  here  the  air  fights  with  the  water  as  will  be  said  in  its 
place.  You  should  not  forget  however  to  say  that  this  descent  of  the 
water  is  checked  by  the  condensation  of  the  air  in  the  conduit  where 
the  water  is.  k  103  [23]  v. 

If  the  waters  that  enter  into  a  reservoir  or  issue  forth  from  it  have 
the  holes  of  exit  equal  to  the  holes  of  entry,  and  the  fall  of  the  entry  is 
longer  than  that  of  the  exit,  the  entry  will  then  be  greater  than  the 
exit  until  the  water  of  the  basin  rises,  and  then  they  will  become  equal. 

k  104  [24]  r. 

And  if  the  fall  of  the  entry  is  more  beneath  the  surface  than  the 
fall  of  the  exit,  although  they  are  of  the  same  size,  the  entry  will  be 
greater  than  the  exit  until  their  powers  equalise  themselves. 


730  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

But  if  in  this  case  the  exit  covers  a  longer  space  of  the  surface  than 
the  entry  does  then  the  exit  will  be  greater  than  the  entry.

What  shape  will  the  same  quantity  of  water  moving  along  the  same 
slant  have  in  order  that  it  may  be  as  swift  as  possible? 

Let  it  have  that  which  will  make  least  contact  with  the  bottom,  that 
is  a  half-circle. 

That  water  will  be  swifter  when  the  part  that  makes  eddies  through 
striking  upon  the  bottom  and  the  sides  is  less  in  bulk  than  the  rest; 
and  this  is  the  greatest  river.  k  105  [25]  r. 

[Relation  of  wave  and  wind]  [Diagram] 

The  wave  increases  because  the  wind  increases. 

D  b  e  f  the  wind,  strikes  e  f  the  water,  and  causes  it  to  overflow;  d  a 
e  c  the  second  part  of  the  same  wind  finds  c  e  prepared  to  overflow, 
having  come  from  e  /,  and  comes  behind  it  with  its  power;  and  dou- 
bles the  power  t  v  e  f  and  so  makes  the  wave  double,    k  106  [26]  v. 

Whether  the  percussion  made  by  the  water  upon  its  object,  is  equal 
in  power  to  the  whole  mass  of  the  water  that  strikes  when  it  finds  itself 
in  the  air,  or  no. 

Which  is  the  easier,  to  raise  the  sluice  of  the  mill  with  the  water 
flowing,  up  or  down  or  across,  or  when  the  water  is  still. 

k  117  [37]  r. 

Vessels  of  equal  capacity  and  full  of  water  in  double  proportion  and 
which  empty  themselves  by  holes  made  in  their  lowest  depth,  in  each 
degree  of  time  will  change  the  degrees  of  proportions  in  the  copious- 
ness of  their  discharges. 

I  maintain  that  if  at  the  commencement  of  the  discharge  the  water 
is  of  double  quantity,  the  amount  of  the  discharge  is  immediately 
double  in  the  one  case  what  it  is  in  the  other,  varying  immediately;  in 
such  a  way  that  if  the  descents  are  divided  in  six  stages  in  the  lesser 
vessel  and  twelve  in  the  larger  one,  when  the  lesser  vessel  has  had  a 
drop  of  five  stages  and  the  greater  five  also,  this  lesser  vessel  is  left 
with  one  stage  of  height  of  water  and  the  larger  with  seven,  which  is 
in  proportion  seven  times  as  great.  k  128  [48]  r. 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  731 

\  Fill  I  of  water] 

Water  which  falls  in  the  form  of  a  pyramid  by  a  perpendicular  line 
upon  a  level  surface  will  leap  up  again  to  a  height  and  will  end  its 
point  towards  the  base  of  this  pyramid,  and  will  then  intersect  and 
pass  beyond  it  and  fall  down.  l  i  r. 

[  Air  replacing  water] 

Why  the  air  which  fills  up  the  void  in  a  globe  from  whence  the 
water  emerges,  enters  with  the  same  impetus  as  that  of  the  water  which 
is  poured  out.  Whatever  is  resting  upon  this  water  turns  in  contrary 
movement  to  that  of  the  water.  l  17  v. 

[  Rivers] 

The  long  thing  of  uniform  thickness  swells  as  much  in  its  two 
opposite  sides  as  it  is  lowered  in  its  two  other  opposite  sides. 

Here  the  water  which  is  confined  in  the  parallel  river  increases  as 
much  in  height  as  it  is  lacking  in  breadth;  consequently  as  it  falls  it 
hollows  out  the  place  where  it  has  struck. 

The  parallel  rivers  may  at  some  part  of  their  length  be  confined  in 
two  ways,  namely  between  their  surface  and  their  bed  or  upon  their 
opposite  sides.  l  30  r. 

[Falls  of  water] 

When  two  streams  of  water  meet  at  an  extremely  sharp  angle  the 
more  powerful  hollows  out  its  side  of  the  base  most,  and  makes  a  sud- 
den depth. 

This  is  the  true  way  of  giving  the  fall  while  conserving  the  bank  to 
the  water  which  descends  from  the  said  bank.  l  31  v. 

[The  course  of  rivers] 

The  beds  of  the  rivers  uncovered  naturally,  do  not  give  true  indica- 
tions of  the  nature  and  quantity  of  the  objects  carried  by  the  waters, 
because  in  the  deep  waters  many  places  are  filled  with  sand,  and  after- 
wards in  the  particular  lateral  courses  of  the  rivers  these  deposits  of 
sand  are  borne  above  the  shingle  on  which  they  rested  or  laid  bare 
beneath,  so  causing  the  continual  subsidence  of  the  raised  bank  of  this 
sand  which  by  reason  of  its  lightness  accompanies  it  in  its  course  and 
is  then  deposited  where  the  current  of  the  water  becomes  more 
tranquil. 


732  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

The  twistings  of  rivers  in  flood  are  such  as  to  burst  every  dike  and 
all  the  order  that  the  river  keeps  when  low.  l  32  r. 

[Falls  and  courses  of  water] 

Water  that  has  fallen  with  great  impetus  from  its  dam  reproduces 
die  twistings  of  the  rivers  according  to  the  line  of  its  fall,  but  when  the 
waters  subside,  although  the  line  a  b  keeps  its  place  even  if  this  river 
should  swell  again,  the  canal  a  b  will  become  filled  with  sand,  and  the 
volume  of  the  water  will  follow  its  natural  course.  l  32  v. 

[Water  in  percussion] 

When  water  strikes  it  rises,  and  it  acquires  weight  in  proportion  as 
it  leaps  out  of  its  common  surface;  this  fallen  back  upon,  the  other 
water  strikes  it  and  penetrates  as  far  as  its  bed,  which  it  consumes 
perpetually;  and  such  a  hollow  is  formed  in  the  length  of  the  sides  of 
the  object  struck. 

To  guard  against  this  a  flat  surface  may  be  formed  round  any 
column  which  has  a  firm  base  and  is  of  such  breadth  that  the  water 
that  falls  back  is  compelled  to  find  it.  l  33  r. 

The  less  curved  the  bank  where  the  leap  of  the  river  strikes  it  the 
farther  removed  will  the  second  leap  be  from  the  spot  from  which  the 
first  departed.  l  36  v. 

The  eddies  of  rivers  are  of  several  kinds;  of  these  some  are  hollow 
in  the  centre  after  the  manner  of  a  concave  pyramid;  others  full  in  the 
centre  like  a  raised  cone;  some  throw  things  up  from  the  bottom, 
others  submerge  things  borne  on  the  surface  of  the  water;  and  the  one 
creates  a  hollow  underneath  the  bank  which  forms  its  side,  the  other 
fills  it  up. 

These  eddies  serve  the  purpose  by  their  revolutions  and  delays  of 
equalising  the  excessive  speed  of  the  rivers;  and  as  therefore  the  eddies 
at  the  side  are  not  sufficient,  by  reason  of  the  narrowness  of  the  rivers, 
it  becomes  necessary  that  new  kinds  of  eddies  should  be  created  which 
shall  turn  the  water  over  from  the  surface  to  the  bottom  and  at  various 
different  angles;  of  these  some  meet  at  the  bottom  and  churn  up  all 
the  soil  which  the  eddy  of  the  surface  has  in  course  of  time  deposited. 
And  the  other  eddies  do  the  same  against  the  banks  of  the  rivers.

[Of  water] 

This  wears  away  the  lofty  summits  of  the  mountains.  It  lays  bare 
and  carries  away  the  great  rocks.  It  drives  away  the  sea  from  its  ancient 
shores  for  it  raises  its  base  with  the  soil  that  it  carries  there.  It  shatters 
and  devastates  the  high  banks;  nor  can  any  stability  ever  be  discerned 
in  these  which  its  nature  does  not  suddenly  bring  to  naught.  It  seeks 
out  with  its  rivers  every  sloping  valley  where  it  may  carry  off  or  de- 
posit fresh  soil.  Wherefore  many  rivers  may  be  said  to  be  those  through 
which  all  the  element  has  passed,  and  the  sea  has  gone  back  many 
times  to  the  sea,  and  no  part  of  the  earth  is  so  high  but  that  the  sea 
has  been  at  its  foundations,  and  no  depth  of  the  ocean  is  so  low  but 
that  the  loftiest  mountains  have  their  bases  there.  And  so  it  is  some- 
times sharp  and  sometimes  strong,  sometimes  acid  and  sometimes  bit- 
ter, sometimes  sweet  and  sometimes  thick  or  thin,  sometimes  it  is  seen 
bringing  hurt  or  pestilence,  sometimes  health-giving,  sometimes  poi- 
sonous. So  one  would  say  that  it  suffers  change  into  as  many  natures 
as  are  the  different  places  through  which  it  passes.  And  as  the  mirror 
changes  with  the  colour  of  its  object  so  it  changes  with  the  nature  of 
the  place  through  which  it  passes: — health-giving,  noisome,  laxative, 
astringent,  sulphurous,  salt,  incarnadined,  mournful,  raging,  angry, 
red,  yellow,  green,  black,  blue,  greasy,  fat,  thin.  Sometimes  it  starts  a 
conflagration,  sometimes  it  extinguishes  one;  is  warm  and  is  cold; 
carries  away  or  sets  down,  hollows  out  or  raises  up,  tears  down  or  es- 
tablishes, fills  up  or  empties,  raises  itself  up  or  burrows  down,  speeds 
or  is  still,  is  the  cause  at  times  of  life  or  death,  of  increase  or  privation, 
nourishes  at  times  and  at  times  does  the  contrary,  at  times  has  a  tang 
of  salt,  at  times  is  without  savour,  at  times  submerges  the  wide  valleys 
with  great  floods.  With  time  everything  changes.  b.m.  57  r. 

At  times  it  goes  twisting  to  the  northern  parts,  eating  away  the  base 
of  its  bank;  at  times  it  overthrows  the  bank  opposite  on  the  south;  at 
times  it  turns  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth  consuming  the  base 
which  supports  it;  at  times  leaps  up  seething  and  boiling  towards  the

sky;  at  times  revolving  in  a  circle  it  confounds  its  course;  at  times  it 
extends  on  the  western  side  robbing  the  husbandmen  of  their  tilth;  at 
times  it  deposits  the  soil  it  has  carried  away  in  the  eastern  parts.  And 
thus  at  times  it  digs  out,  and  at  times  fills  in  where  it  has  taken  away 
and  where  it  has  made  a  deposit.  Thus  without  any  rest  it  is  ever  re- 
moving and  consuming  whatever  borders  upon  it.  So  at  times  it  is 
turbulent  and  goes  ravening  in  fury,  at  times  clear  and  tranquil  it 
meanders  playfully  with  gentle  course  among  the  fresh  verdure.  At 
times  falls  from  the  sky  in  rain  or  snow  or  hail;  at  times  forms  great 
clouds  out  of  fine  mist.  At  times  moved  of  itself,  at  times  by  the  force 
of  others;  at  times  gives  increase  to  things  that  are  born  by  its  life- 
giving  moisture,  at  times  shows  itself  either  fetid  or  full  of  pleasant 
odours.  Without  it  nothing  can  exist  among  us.  At  times  it  is  bathed 
in  the  hot  element  and  dissolving  into  vapour  becomes  mingled  with 
the  atmosphere,  and  drawn  upwards  by  the  heat  it  rises  until  having 
found  the  cold  region  it  is  pressed  closer  together  by  its  contrary  na- 
ture, and  the  minute  particles  become  attached  together.  And  as  when 
the  hand  under  water  squeezes  a  sponge  which  is  well  saturated  so 
that  the  water  shut  up  in  it  as  it  escapes  through  the  crevices  is  driven 
into  the  rest  and  drives  this  from  its  position  by  its  wave,  so  it  is  with 
the  cold  which  the  warm  moisture  compresses,  for  when  it  has  reduced 
it  to  a  more  solid  form  the  air  that  is  pent  up  within  it  breaks  by 
force  the  weakest  part,  and  hisses  just  as  though  it  was  coming  out  of 
bellows  when  they  are  pressed  down  by  an  insupportable  weight.  And 
thus  in  various  positions  it  drives  away  the  lighter  clouds  which  form

[Why  the  beds  of  straight  rivers  are  deeper  in  the  centre  than  at  the 
sides] 

The  current  of  a  straight  river  is  higher  in  the  centre  than  at  the 
sides,  and  rises  towards  the  sky  with  greater  waves  and  turns  in  greater 
depth  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth. 

And  this  occurs  because  the  current  is  the  clashing  together  or  inter- 
section of  the  reflex  movement  of  the  waves,  which  leap  back  after 
striking  against  the  bank  and  running  back  to  the  opposite  bank 
clash  with  the  contrary  movements,  and  these  resisting  each  other  and 
neither  being  able  to  penetrate  into  the  other  leap  back  high  out  of 
the  water,  and  then  falling  back — having  acquired  weight  while  in  the 
air — plunge  beneath  the  water  there  where  they  strike  it. 

b.m.  135  v. 

How  rivers  widen  their  valleys  and  wear  away  the  roots  of  the 
mountains  at  their  sides: 

The  bases  of  the  hills  as  their  valleys  grow  deeper  are  bent  back 
towards  the  course  of  the  river,  as  though  they  should  wish  to  de- 
mand back  from  the  speeding  river  the  soil  of  which  it  has  despoiled 
them. 

This  proceeds  from  the  nineteenth  of  this  treatise  which  says:  the 
current  of  the  river  eats  away  the  base  of  the  mountain  on  one  side 
where  it  strikes  and  gives  it  back  to  the  opposite  side  to  which  it  is 
deflected. 

In  great  valleys  the  river  changes  its  bed. 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  737 

The  rivers  in  great  valleys  make  greater  changes  in  their  heds  in 
proportion  as  they  are  farther  away  from  the  roots  of  the  mountains. 
This  is  proved  by  the  ninth  of  this  which  says:  the  largest  rivers  flow 
through  the  largest  valleys  which  have  been  made  by  them,  and  by 
reason  of  their  size  they  are  continually  consuming  the  waves  that  flow 
from  their  banks,  carrying  them  always  back  to  the  current  of  the 
river. 

OF  CHANGES  IN  THE  MOUTHS  OF  RIVERS 

The  mouths  of  rivers  are  continually  bending  and  descending  behind 
the  course  of  their  principal  stream,  and  this  proceeds  from  the  former 
[rule]  which  says:  water  takes  away  with  its  wave  from  the  bank 
where  it  strikes  and  gives  back  to  the  opposite  bank  where  it  is 
deflected. 

Valleys  are  continually  growing  deeper. 

Valleys  continually  grow  wider  and  deeper  and  rivers  continually

PERCUSSION  OF  WATER  FALLING  UPON  DIVERS  OBJECTS 

The  water  which  falls  in  a  perpendicular  line  through  a  round  pipe 
upon  a  level  place  will  make  a  circumambient  wave  round  the  site  of 
its  percussion,  within  the  circumference  of  which  the  water  will  move 
very  rapidly  and  be  spread  very  thinly  round  about  this  place  which 
has  been  struck,  and  at  the  end  it  will  strike  into  the  wave  produced 
by  it  which  seeks  to  return  to  the  place  of  the  percussion. 

b.m.  167  v. 

Water  is  that  which  serves  the  vital  humour  of  this  arid  earth. 

It  is  the  cause  which  moves  it  through  its  veins  contrary  to  the 
natural  course  (desire)  of  weighty  things;  it  is  like  that  which  moves 
the  humours  in  all  kinds  of  living  bodies,  and  .  .  . 

And  as  the  water  is  driven  up  from  the  lower  part  of  the  vine 
towards  its  severed  stems  and  afterwards  falls  back  to  its  roots,  pene- 
trates these  and  rises  again  anew,  so  from  the  lowest  depth  of  the  sea 
the  water  rises  to  the  tops  of  the  mountains,  and  falls  down  through 
their  burst  veins  and  returns  to  the  sea  and  rises  again  anew.  Thus  up 


738  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

and  down,  in  and  out,  unresting,  now  with  fortuitous,  and  now  with 
natural  motion,  now  in  its  liberty  and  now  constrained  by  its  mover,  it 
goes  revolving  and,  after  returning  in  force  to  its  mover,  rises  again 
anew  and  then  falls  anew;  so  as  one  part  rises  the  other  descends. 

Thus  from  the  lowest  depths  of  the  sea  the  water  rises  up  to  the 
summits  of  the  mountains  and  falls  down  low  through  the  burst  veins, 
and  at  the  same  time  other  water  is  rising:  so  the  whole  element 
ranges  about  and  makes  its  passage  many  times  through  the  rivers 
that  fall  into  the  sea. 

At  one  time  it  becomes  changed  to  the  loftiest  clouds,  and  afterwards 
it  is  pent  up  within  the  deep  caverns  of  the  earth. 

It  has  nothing  of  itself,  but  moves  and  takes  everything,  as  is  clearly 
shown  when  it  is  distilled. 

Thus  hither  and  thither,  up  and  down,  it  ranges,  never  resting  at  all 
in  quietude,  always  flowing  to  help  wherever  the  vital  humour  fails. 

Now  taking  away  the  soil,  now  adding  to  it,  here  depositing  logs 
there  stones  here  bearing  sand  there  mud,  with  nothing  stable  in  bed

quillity, now  showing  itself  with  fierce  aspect,  now  appearing  bright

in  tempestuous  rain;  now  changed  to  snow  or  storms  of  hail,  now 
bathing  the  air  with  fine  rain;  so  also  now  turning  to  ice  and  now  hot; 
never  keeping  any  stability;  now  rising  aloft  in  thin  cloud,  compressing 
the  air  where  it  shuts  it  in,  so  that  it  moves  through  the  other  air  after 
the  fashion  of  a  sponge  squeezed  beneath  the  water,  when  what  is 
enclosed  within  it  is  driven  out  through  the  rest  of  the  water.

The  heat  that  is  poured  into  animated  bodies  moves  the  humours 
which  nourish  them. 

The  movement  made  by  this  humour  is  the  conservation  of  itself 
and  the  vivification  of  the  body  which  contains  it. 

Water  is  that  which  serves  the  vital  humour  of  the  arid  earth;  it  is 
poured  within  it,  and  flowing  with  unceasing  vigour  through  the 
spreading  veins  it  replenishes  all  the  parts  that  depend  of  necessity  on 
this  humour. 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  739 

And  it  flows  from  the  vast  depths  of  the  mighty  ocean  in  the  deep 
wide  caverns  that  lie  hid  within  the  bowels  of  the  earth,  whence 
through  the  spreading  veins  upwards  against  its  natural  course  in  con- 
tinual ascent  to  the  high  summits  of  the  mountains  it  returns  through 
the  burst  veins  to  the  deep. 

Water  is  that  which  serves  the  vital  humour  of  the  arid  earth;  and 
the  cause  which  moves  it  through  the  veins  is  just  that  which  moves 
the  humours  in  all  the  different  species  of  animated  bodies. 

b.m.  234  r. 

Water  which  serves  as  the  vital  humour  of  the  arid  earth  and  for 
this  same  cause  moves  through  the  spreading  veins,  is  poured  into  it 
and  works  within  it  as  does  the  blood  in  human  bodies. 

The  same  cause  moves  the  water  through  its  spreading  veins  as  that 
which  moves  the  blood  in  the  human  species,  and  as  through  the  burst 
veins  in  the  top  of  a  man  the  blood  from  below  issues  forth,  so  through 
the  burst  veins  in  the  summits  of  the  mountains  the  waters  from  below 
are  poured  out. 

Water  after  having  issued  forth  from  the  veins  of  the  earth  is  aban- 
doned by  the  moving  cause  which  led  it  there. 

Water  in  falling  from  the  high  summits  observes  in  its  movement 
the  desire  of  all  the  other  heavy  things.  b.m.  234  v. 

And  that  which  with  the  utmost  admiration  of  those  who  contem- 
plate it  raises  itself  from  the  lowest  depth  of  the  sea  to  the  highest 
summits  of  the  mountains,  and  pouring  through  the  broken  veins  re- 
turns to  the  shallow  parts  of  the  sea,  and  again  rises  with  swiftness 
and  returns  in  like  descent,  and  thus  in  course  of  time  its  whole  ele- 
ment circulates. 

So  from  high  to  low,  so  passing  in  and  out,  now  with  natural  and 
now  with  fortuitous  movement  it  proceeds,  together  and  united.  So 
with  continual  revolution  it  goes  ranging  round,  after  the  manner  of 
the  water  of  the  vine,  which  as  it  pours  through  its  severed  branches 
and  falls  back  upon  its  roots  rises  again  through  the  passages,  and 
falling  back  returns  in  a  similar  revolution. 

The  water  which  sees  the  air  through  the  broken  veins  of  the  high 
summits  of  the  mountains,  is  suddenly  abandoned  by  the  power  which 


740  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

led  it  there;  and  when  the  water  escapes  from  the  forces  which  raise  it 
to  a  height  it  resumes  in  liberty  its  natural  course. 

In  the  same  way,  so  does  the  water  that  rises  from  the  low  roots  of 
the  vine  to  its  lofty  summit,  and  falling  through  the  severed  branches 
upon  the  primal  roots  mounts  anew  to  the  place  whence  it  fell. 

b.m.  235  r. 

Water  is  just  that  which  is  appointed  to  serve  as  the  vital  humour  of 
this  arid  earth,  and  the  cause  which  moves  it  through  its  spreading 
veins,  contrary  to  the  natural  course  of  heavy  things,  is  just  what 
moves  the  humours  in  all  the  species  of  animated  bodies. 

This  it  is  which  to  the  complete  stupefaction  of  the  beholders  rises 
from  the  lowest  depths  of  the  sea  to  the  highest  summits  of  the  moun- 
tains, and  pouring  out  through  the  burst  veins  returns  to  the  depths  of 
the  sea  and  rises  again  swiftly  and  again  descends  as  aforesaid.  So 
from  the  outer  parts,  to  the  inner,  so  turning  from  the  lower  to  the 
higher,  at  times  it  rises  in  fortuitous  movement,  at  times  rushes  down 
in  natural  course.  So  combining  these  two  movements  in  perpetual 
revolution  it  goes  ranging  through  the  channels  of  the  earth. 

b.m.  236  v. 

OF  THE  WEIGHT  OF  THE  WATER 

Either  the  water  has  weight  or  it  has  not  weight.  And  if  it  has 
weight,  why  does  not  it  bend  the  leaves  borne  on  the  bed  where  it 
rests?  And  if  it  does  not  bend  them,  it  does  not  give  its  gravity  to  the 
bottom  of  the  water.  And  if  it  does  not  give  its  gravity,  what  supports 
it?  Its  bed  supports  it,  but  it  does  not  receive  weight,  because  it  is 
proved  that  water  has  no  weight  except  above  an  element  lighter  than 
itself  such  as  air  and  fire,  and  other  liquids  such  as  oil  and  the  like. 
And  if  this  is  the  case,  why  does  a  vase  in  the  air  weigh  more  when 
full  of  water  than  when  full  of  air?  The  water  does  not  weigh  on 
their  sides,  but  the  vase  when  filled  has  weight  in  the  air,  which  it 
would  not  have  under  water  except  to  the  extent  of  the  weight  of  the 
material  of  which  the  vase  is  made.  And  the  sea  does  the  same  upon 
its  vase  the  earth,  and  the  shores  uncovered  to  the  air  are  the  lips  of 
the  vase  that  receives  it.  Which  vase,  being  conjoined  to  the  rest  of 
the  earth,  throws  its  weight  upon  the  air  of  its  antipodes  in  the  increase 


THE  NATURE   OF   WATER  741 

of  the-  sea,  because  such  antipodean  seas  balance  each  other  in  their 
weights  through  being  opposite;  and  the  inequality  produced  their 
weights,  and  from  this  caused  the  sea  to  be  changing  its  position  con- 
tinually, the  centre  of  gravity  of  the  earth  together  with  the  water 
also  changing  its  position.  b.m.  266  v. 

[Drawings] 

Because  n  c  is  of  a  width  similar  to  a  0,  and  in  like  manner  because 
m  i  is  slightly  less,  these  waters  will  be  almost  all  at  one  level. 

Forster  in  32  v. 

The  water  a  b  will  be  very  considerably  higher  than  the  water  d  e. 

The  water  r  m  will  be  almost  equal,  and  the  part  o  of  the  back-cur- 
rent will  be  extremely  shallow  and  will  hollow  out  the  bed;  p  will  be 
higher  by  reason  of  the  percussion,  x  lower  at  the  mill  .  .  . 

Forster  in  33  r. 

SIGNS  OF  HIDDEN  DEPTHS  OF  WATER 

When  within  the  smooth  water  you  see  a  spreading  eddy  there  is  a 
fall  and  rebound  of  water.  Forster  m  40  r. 

MOVEMENT  OF  WATER 

Why  do  the  lines  of  the  water  pouring  into  a  hole  not  direct  them- 
selves to  its  centre?  Forster  in  75  v. 

Why  do  the  circles  of  the  water  not  break  when  they  intersect? 

Forster  in  76  r. 

Why  the  water  is  higher  in  one  part  of  the  sea  or  river  than  in  an- 
other, and  why  in  many  rapidly  moving  eddies  the  water  is  lower  in 
the  centre  of  the  eddies  than  at  the  sides. 

On  the  Movements  of  Liquids  by  Galen.  Quaderni  11   16  r. 

Water  cannot  move  of  itself  unless  it  descends,  and  if  it  moves  with- 
out descending  it  is  moved  by  something  else,  and  if  it  moves  without 
being  moved  by  anything  else  it  is  a  reflex  movement  and  of  short  life. 

Quaderni   11   16  v. 


742  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

On  how  to  bend  the  course  of  a  river  through  its  valley. 

And  you  who  desire  to  control  the  course  of  the  river  and  to  be 
obeyed  by  it,  you  only  need  to  cause  its  current  to  bend,  for  where 
this  bends  it  wears  away  the  bottom  and  draws  after  it  all  the  rest  of 
the  water  of  its  river.  Quaderni    iv   2   r. 


WHAT  IS  THE  CURRENT  OF  WATER 

The  current  of  water  is  the  concourse  of  the  reflections  which  re- 
bound from  the  bank  of  the  river  towards  its  centre,  in  which  con- 
course the  two  streams  of  water  thrown  back  from  the  opposite  banks 
of  the  river  encounter  each  other;  and  these  waters  as  they  encounter 
each  other  produce  the  biggest  waves  of  the  river,  and  as  these  fall 
back  into  the  water  they  penetrate  it  and  strike  against  the  bottom  as 
though  they  were  a  substance  heavier  than  the  rest  of  the  water,  and 
rub  against  the  bottom,  ploughing  it  up  and  consuming  it,  and  carry- 
ing ofiE  and  transporting  with  them  the  material  they  have  dislodged. 
And  therefore  the  greatest  depth  of  the  water  of  a  river  is  always  be- 
low the  greatest  current. 

It  is  possible  for  water  in  a  brief  time  to  perforate  and  make  a  passage 
through  stone.  Quaderni  iv  2  r. 

Watch  the  movement  of  the  surface  of  water,  how  like  it  is  to  that 
of  hair,  which  has  two  movements,  one  following  the  undulation  of 
the  surface,  the  other  the  lines  of  the  curves:  thus  water  forms  whirl- 
ing eddies,  part  following  the  impetus  of  the  chief  current,  part  the 
rising  and  falling  movement.  Windsor:   Drawings    12579   r. 

The  movement  of  the  wave  is  swifter  than  the  movement  of  the 
water  that  produces  it.  This  is  seen  by  throwing  a  stone  into  still  water, 
for  it  creates  around  the  spot  where  it  strikes  a  circular  movement 
which  is  swift,  and  the  water  which  creates  this  circular  swelling  does 
not  move  from  its  position  nor  do  the  objects  which  float  on  the  sur- 
face of  the  water.  Leic.  14  v. 

[With   drawing  of  section  of  river  in   which  are  the  words  'Arno\

When  a  lesser  river  pours  its  waters  into  a  greater  and  this  greater 


THE   NATURE  OF   WATER  743 

flows  from  the  opposite  bank,  the  course  of  the  lesser  river  will  be  bent 
by  the  onset  of  the  greater.  And  this  occurs  because  when  this  greater 
river  fills  up  the  whole  of  its  bed  with  water  it  comes  to  form  an  eddy 
under  the  mouth  of  this  river,  and  thus  drives  with  it  the  water  that 
has  been  poured  out  by  the  lesser  river.  When  the  lesser  river  pours 
its  waters  into  the  greater  river  which  has  its  current  crossing  the 
mouth  of  the  lesser  river,  its  waters  will  bend  in  the  direction  of  the 
current  of  the  greater  river.  Leic.  15  r.

Whether  the  flow  and  ebb  are  caused  by  the  moon  or  sun,  or  are  the 
breathing  of  this  machine  of  the  earth.  How  the  flow  and  ebb  differ  in 
different  countries  and  seas. 

How  in  the  end  the  mountains  will  be  levelled  by  the  waters,  seeing 
that  they  wash  away  the  earth  which  covers  them  and  uncover  their 
rocks,  which  begin  to  crumble  and  are  being  continually  changed  into 
soil  subdued  alike  by  heat  and  frost.  The  waters  wear  away  their  bases 


744  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

and  the  mountains  bit  by  bit  fall  in  ruin  into  the  rivers  which  have 
worn  away  their  bases,  and  by  reason  of  this  ruin  the  waters  rise  in  a 
swirling  flood  and  form  great  seas. 

How  in  violent  tempests  the  waves  throw  down  every  light  thing 
and  suck  much  earth  into  the  sea,  which  causes  the  water  of  the  sea 
to  be  turbid  over  a  wide  space. 

How  loose  stones  at  the  base  of  wide  steep-sided  valleys  when  they 
have  been  struck  by  the  waves  become  rounded  bodies,  and  many 
things  do  the  same  when  pushed  or  sucked  into  the  sea  by  these 
waves. 

How  the  waves  quiet  down  and  make  long  stretches  of  calm  water 
within  the  sea  without  any  movement  when  two  opposite  winds  meec 
together  at  this  spot;  thus  at  these  meeting  places  various  shapes  made 
up  of  calm  sea  are  visible  surrounded  by  the  tiny  waves  of  a  moderate 
sea.  Leic.  17  v. 

PROPOSITIONS 

Water  of  itself  does  not  move  unless  it  descends. 

That  water  will  be  highest  which  is  farthest  removed  from  the  centre 
of  its  sphere.  And  that  surface  of  water  is  said  to  be  lowest  which  is 
nearest  to  the  centre  of  its  sphere. 

No  surface  of  water  which  is  contiguous  to  the  air  is  lower  than  the 
surface  of  its  sphere.  The  waters  of  the  salt  seas  are  fresh  at  their  maxi- 
mum depth.  The  waters  range  with  perpetual  movement  from  the 
lowest  depths  of  the  seas  to  the  topmost  summits  of  the  mountains, 
not  following  the  law  of  heavy  things;  and  in  this  instance  its  action 
resembles  that  of  the  blood  of  animals  which  is  always  moving  from 
the  sea  of  the  heart  and  flowing  towards  the  summit  of  their  head; 
and  so  when  a  vein  there  has  burst  open,  as  one  sees  if  a  vein  bursts  in 
the  nose,  the  whole  of  the  blood  from  below  rises  up  to  the  height 
where  the  vein  has  burst. 

When  the  water  gushes  forth  from  the  burst  vein  in  the  earth  it 
follows  the  law  of  other  things  which  are  heavier  than  the  air  and  so 
always  seeks  the  low  places. 

That  water  will  be  swifter  which  descends  by  the  less  slanting  line. 
And  that  water  will  be  slower  which  moves  along  a  more  slanting  line. 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  745 

The  Nile  and  the  other  rivers  of  great  size  have  very  many  times 
poured  out  the  whole  of  the  element  of  water  and  restored  it  to  the 
sea.  The  veins  flow  with  infinite  ramifications  through  the  body  of  the 
earth.  The  waters  assume  as  many  different  natures  as  the  places  are 
different  through  which  they  pass.  If  it  were  possible  to  make  a  well 
which  should  pass  through  the  earth  on  the  opposite  side  and  for  a 
river  to  descend  through  this  well,  the  head  of  the  river  which  entered 
there  first  would  descend  through  this  well  and  pass  the  centre  of  the 
elements  without  making  any  reflex  movement,  and  it  would  pour  as 
much  water  on  the  far  side  of  this  centre  as  it  had  from  the  opposite 
side. 

And  if,  because  of  some  deep  valley,  the  line  on  the  opposite  side  of 
the  well  were  shorter  than  on  this  side,  this  water  would  fill  up  the 
valley,  however  large  it  was,  until  it  equalled  the  weight  of  the  water 
in  the  well,  although  in  some  part  the  centre  (of  gravity)  of  the  water 
and  of  the  earth  united  together  would  move  somewhat  from  its  fipt 
position  through  the  weight  of  the  water,  which  would  be  increased 
on  the  opposite  side  of  the  earth  where  it  was  not  at  first.  The  centre 
(of  gravity)  of  the  water  and  earth  joined  together  is  moved  when 
the  weight  of  the  sea  moves  because  it  is  carried  by  the  winds.

THIRTY-NINE  CASES 

How  the  bottoms  of  rivers  and  ditches  become  trampled  by  big 
animals  and  this  causes  the  muddy  waters  to  escape  and  they  thus 
leave  in  their  course  the  soil  in  which  they  were  loitering.  How  in  the 
manner  described  above  canals  may  be  constructed  through  level  lands. 
How  to  convey  away  the  soil  from  canals  which  have  become  choked 
up  with  mud  by  the  opening  of  certain  sluices  which  are  moved  up- 
wards by  the  canal. 

How  one  ought  to  straighten  rivers.  How  one  ought  so  to  provide 
that  rivers  do  not  sweep  away  other  men's  possessions.  How  one  ought 
to  maintain  the  beds  of  rivers.  How  one  ought  to  maintain  the  banks. 
How  the  banks  when  broken  should  be  repaired.  How  one  ought  to 
regulate  the  impetus  of  rivers  in  order  to  strike  terror  into  the  enemy 
so  that  he  may  not  enter  the  valleys  of  this  river  to  damage  them. 

How  the  river  in  order  to  be  crossed  by  your  army  ought  to  be  con-

verted  into  many  small  branches.  How  one  ought  to  ford  rivers  below 
the  rows  of  horses  so  that  they  may  protect  the  infantry  from  the  rush 
of  the  water. 

How  by  the  use  of  wine-skins  an  army  is  able  to  cross  a  river  by 
swimming.  How  the  shores  of  all  the  seas  that  touch  one  another  are 
of  equal  height,  and  are  the  lowest  part  of  the  land  which  meets  the 
air.  Of  the  manner  of  swimming  of  fishes;  of  the  way  in  which  they 
leap  out  of  the  water  as  may  be  seen  with  dolphins,  for  it  seems  a 
marvellous  thing  to  make  a  leap  upon  something  which  does  not  stand 
firm  but  slips  away. 

Of  the  manner  of  swimming  of  animals  of  long  shape  such  as  eels 
and  the  like.  Of  the  way  of  swimming  against  the  currents  and  great 
falls  of  rivers.  Of  the  way  in  which  fishes  swim  when  they  are  round 
in  shape.  How  animals  which  do  not  have  the  hoof  cleft  asunder  are 
not  able  to  swim.  How  all  the  other  animals  which  have  feet  with  toes 
ar^by  nature  able  to  swim,  except  man.  In  what  way  a  man  ought  to 
learn  to  swim.  Of  the  way  in  which  a  man  should  rest  upon  the  water. 
How  a  man  ought  to  defend  himself  against  the  whirlpools  or  eddies 
of  the  waters  which  suck  him  down  to  the  bottom.  How  a  man  when 
sucked  down  to  the  bottom  has  to  seek  the  reflex  current  which  will 
cast  him  out  of  the  depths.  How  he  ought  to  propel  himself  with  his 
arms.  How  he  ought  to  swim  on  his  back. 

How  he  can  only  remain  under  water  for  such  time  as  he  can  hold 
his  breath. 

How  by  an  appliance  many  are  able  to  remain  for  some  time  under 
water.  How  and  why  I  do  not  describe  my  method  of  remaining  under 
water  for  as  long  a  time  as  I  can  remain  without  food;  and  this  I  do 
not  publish  or  divulge  on  account  of  the  evil  nature  of  men  who 
would  practice  assassinations  at  the  bottom  of  the  seas  by  breaking  the 
ships  in  their  lowest  parts  and  sinking  them  together  with  the  crews 
who  are  in  them;  and  although  I  will  furnish  particulars  of  others  they 
are  such  as  are  not  dangerous,  for  above  the  surface  of  the  water 
emerges  the  mouth  of  the  tube  by  which  they  draw  in  breath,  sup- 
ported upon  wine-skins  or  pieces  of  cork. 

How  the  waves  of  the  seas  continually  consume  their  promontories 
and  rocks.  How  the  shores  of  the  seas  grow  continually  towards  the 


THE   NATURE   OF   WATER  747 

centre  of  the  sea.  The  reason  why  the  gulfs  of  the  seas  are  created.  The 
cause  why  the  gulfs  become  tilled  up  with  earth  or  seaweed. 

The  cause  why  round  about  the  shores  of  the  seas  there  is  found  a 
large  high  bank  called  the  mound  of  the  sea. 

Why  the  waves  are  higher  when  they  touch  the  bottom  nearer  to  the 
shore  than  they  are  on  the  high  sea. 

How  at  the  mouths  of  certain  valleys  the  gusts  of  wind  strike  down 
upon  the  waters  and  scoop  them  out  in  a  great  hollow,  and  carry  the 
water  up  into  the  air  in  the  shape  of  a  column  and  of  the  colour  of 
cloud. 

And  this  same  thing  I  once  saw  taking  place  on  a  sand-bank  in  the 
Arno,  where  the  sand  was  hollowed  out  to  a  depth  of  more  than  a 
man's  stature,  and  the  gravel  of  it  was  removed  and  whirled  a  great 
distance  apart,  and  assumed  in  the  air  the  form  of  a  mighty  campanile; 
and  the  summit  of  it  grew  like  the  branches  of  a  great  pine,  and  then 
it  bent  on  meeting  the  swift  wind  which  passed  over  the  mountains. 

How  the  wave  is  least  towards  the  approaching  wind  because  the 
bank  serves  it  as  a  shield. 

How  the  water  that  finds  itself  between  the  percussions  of  the  waves 
of  the  sea  becomes  changed  into  mist. 

Of  eddies  wide  at  the  mouth  and  narrow  at  the  base. 

Of  eddies  very  wide  at  the  base  and  narrow  above.

How  waves  do  not  penetrate  one  another  but  leap  back  from  the 
place  where  they  have  struck;  and  every  reflex  movement  flies  away 
at  equal  angles  from  the  striking  place. 

The  reflex  movement  of  water  within  water  will  always  be  of  the 
same  shape  as  its  falling  movement.  By  this  reflex  movement  I  do  not 
mean  that  which  springs  back  within  the  air  but  that  which  follows 
along  its  surface. 

As  the  wave  of  the  sand  moves  considerably  more  slowly  than  the 
wave  of  the  water  that  produces  it,  so  the  wave  of  the  water  created  by 
the  wind  is  much  slower  than  the  wave  of  the  wind  that  produces  it, 
that  is  the  wave  of  the  air.  The  wave  of  the  air  performs  the  same 


748  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

function  within  the  element  of  fire  as  does  the  wave  of  the  water 
within  the  air,  or  the  wave  of  the  sand,  that  is  earth,  within  the  water; 
and  their  movements  are  in  the  same  proportion  one  to  another  as  is 
that  of  the  motive  powers  within  them. 

The  more  powerful  current  will  cleave  asunder  the  less  powerful 
and  pass  through  the  middle  of  it.  Currents  of  equal  power  which 
clash  together  leap  back  from  the  site  of  their  percussion.  A  whole 
mass  of  water  in  its  breadth,  depth  and  height  is  full  of  innumerable 
varieties  of  movements,  as  is  shown  on  the  surface  of  water  of  a  mod- 
erate degree  of  turbulence,  in  which  one  sees  continually  gurglings 
and  vortices,  with  various  eddies  formed  of  the  more  turbid  water 
from  the  bottom  that  rises  to  the  surface.  How  every  seven  years  the 
waters  of  the  Adige  rise  and  then  fall,  and  it  makes  a  famine  as  it 
rises.  Leic.  23  r. 

How  water  has  tenacity  in  itself  and  cohesion  between  its  particles. 
This  is  seen  from  the  fact  that  a  drop  before  separating  itself  from  the 
remainder  stretches  itself  out  as  far  as  it  can,  and  offers  resistance  in 
its  union  until  it  is  conquered  by  the  excessive  weight  of  the  water 
which  is  continually  increasing  upon  it.  How  water  serves  as  a  magnet 
for  other  water.  This  is  seen  in  the  process  of  a  drop  becoming  de- 
tached from  the  remainder,  this  remainder  being  stretched  out  as  far  as 
it  can  through  the  weight  of  the  drop  which  is  extending  it;  and  after 
the  drop  has  been  severed  from  this  mass  the  mass  returns  upwards  with 
a  movement  contrary  to  the  nature  of  heavy  things.  It  may  be  seen 
how  the  larger  drop  of  water  instandy  takes  up  into  itself  the  smaller 
drops  which  come  into  contact  with  it;  and  the  minute  particles  of 
moisture  diffused  through  the  air  act  in  the  same  way,  for  they  be- 
come compressed,  making  themselves  a  magnet  one  for  another  until 
at  last  their  weight  so  increases  as  to  conquer  the  resistance  of  the  air 
that  first  sustained  them,  and  so  they  descend  in  the  form  of  rain. 

It  may  be  shown  with  a  bubble  of  water  how  this  water  is  of  such 
uniform  fineness  that  it  clothes  an  almost  spherical  body  formed  out 
of  air  somewhat  thicker  than  the  other;  and  reason  shows  us  this 
because  as  it  breaks  it  makes  a  certain  amount  of  noise.      Leic.  23  v. 


THE  NATURE   OF   WATER  749 

It  is  possible  to  devise  obstructions  which  will  preserve  the  embank- 
ment against  the  friction  of  the  current. 

You  should  therefore  cause  blocks  of  coarse  shingles  to  be  con- 
structed ten  braccia  apart;  and  let  them  be  ten  braccia  wide  with 
height  varying  according  to  the  height  of  the  embankment  and  of  a 
thickness  of  three  braccia.  And  they  should  be  set  to  slant  in  the  direc- 
tion from  which  the  water  comes;  and  each  of  itself  will  serve  as  a 
shield  to  the  water  and  throw  it  back  towards  the  centre  of  the  stream. 

When  the  obstruction  covered  by  the  water  slants  very  considerably 
in  the  direction  from  which  the  water  comes,  the  stroke  of  the  water 
will  only  cause  a  small  hollow  in  front  of  this  obstruction  and  it  will 
deposit  a  considerable  quantity  of  soil  behind  it. 

If  the  obstruction  is  entirely  upright  and  the  water  flows  over  it  it 
will  form  a  deep  hollow  in  front  of  it  and  will  only  deposit  a  small 
amount  of  soil  behind  it.  And  if  the  obstruction  has  a  lesser  obstruc- 
tion in  front  of  it  which  leans  against  it  there  will  be  no  hollow  in 
front  of  this  lesser  obstruction  for  so  far  as  its  bulk  extends.  If  the 
obstruction  have  another  near  behind  it  the  hill  of  sand  will  be  sud- 
denly cut  and  dug  out  in  a  new  hollow. 

How  the  rivers,  in  their  great  floods,  fill  up  all  their  greatest  depths 
with  sand  or  stones,  except  the  places  where  the  river  is  confined,  as 
when  it  passes  through  the  arches  of  bridges  or  other  constricted 
places;  and  it  does  this  because  behind  these  arches  it  strikes  against 
the  front  of  their  columns,  and  rises  in  a  swirling  flood,  and  raises  it- 
self, and  so  with  fury  makes  up  for  the  delay  that  has  taken  place 
before  the  said  bridge  or  other  object.  Leic.  24  r. 

If  the  obstructions  of  the  waters  are  permanent  the  deep  places  of 
the  rivers  caused  by  them  will  also  be  permanent.  And  if  the  obstruc- 
tion of  these  waters  is  movable  the  deep  places  caused  by  it  will  also 
be  movable.  And  if  the  movable  obstruction  is  near  the  bank  of  the 
river  it  immediately  will  become  the  cause  of  bending  the  whole 
river;  and  this  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  water  which  passes  between 
the  obstruction  and  the  bank  hollows  out  this  bank.  And  even  though 
the  obstruction  proceed  upon  the  bed  of  the  river  behind  the  current 
of  the  waters,  it  does  not  follow  that  the  concavity  already  made  in 
the  bank  will  not  proceed  continually  to  grow  and  increase  because 


750  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

of  the  water  that  ranges  within  it,  as  is  shown  by  the  fourth  of  the 
third;  and  that  the  water  which  leaps  back  from  it  to  the  opposite 
bank  will  not  create  another  similar  concavity  in  this  bank;  and  this 
will  then  proceed  continuously  to  increase,  and  then  it  returns  leaping 
back  beneath  the  first  concavity;  and  so  it  proceeds  time  after  time 
until  this  impetus  is  consumed  amid  the  universal  current  of  the  river. 

Leic.  24  v. 

TWELVE  CASES 

These  are  the  cases  that  have  to  stand  in  the  beginning: 
The  air  which  is  submerged  together  with  the  water  which  has 
struck  upon  the  other  water  returns  to  the  air,  penetrating  the  water 
in  sinuous  movement,  changing  its  substance  into  a  great  number  of 
forms.  And  this  occurs  because  the  light  thing  cannot  remain  under 
the  heavy,  rather  is  it  continually  pressed  by  the  part  of  the  liquid 
which  rests  upon  it;  and  because  the  water  that  stands  there  perpen- 
dicular is  more  powerful  than  the  other  in  its  descent,  this  water  is 
always  driven  away  by  the  part  of  the  water  that  forms  its  coverings, 
and  so  moves  continually  sideways  where  it  is  less  heavy  and  in  conse- 
quence offers  less  resistance,  according  to  the  fifth  of  the  second.  And 
because  this  has  to  make  its  movement  by  the  shortest  way  it  never 
spreads  itself  out  from  its  path  except  to  the  extent  to  which  it  avoids 
that  water  which  covers  it  above. 

When  the  air  enclosed  within  the  water  has  arrived  at  its  surface  it 
immediately  forms  the  figure  of  a  half-sphere,  and  this  is  clothed  with 
an  extremely  thin  film  of  water.  This  occurs  of  necessity  because  water 
has  always  cohesion  in  itself,  and  this  is  the  more  potent  as  the  water 
is  more  sticky;  and  this  air  having  reached  the  opening  of  the  surface 
of  the  water  and  not  finding  there  any  further  weight  to  press  upon 
it,  raises  its  head  through  the  surface  of  the  water  with  as  great  a 
weight  of  water  joined  to  it  as  the  aforesaid  tenacity  can  have;  and 
it  stops  there  in  a  perfect  circle  as  the  base  of  a  half  sphere,  which 
has  the  aforesaid  perfection  because  its  surface  has  been  uniformly 
expanded  by  the  uniform  power  of  the  air.  And  it  cannot  be  more 
than  a  half-sphere  because  spherical  bodies  attain  their  greatest  width 
at  their  diameter;  and  if  this  air  that  is  enclosed  were  more  than  a 
half-sphere  the  base  would  be  less  than  where  the  diametral  line  is, 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  751 

and  consequently  the  arc  of  this  half-sphere  would  not  have  shoulders 
or  real  resistance  in  its  weakest,  that  is  its  widest  part,  and  therefore 
it  would  come  about  that  it  would  break  in  this  spot  of  its  greatest 
width,  because  the  weakest  part  of  any  arc  is  always  the  end  of  its 
greatest  width. 

The  air  emerges  with  impetus  in  spherical  form  clothed  with  an 
extremely  thin  film  of  water,  away  from  the  body  of  the  water;  and 
this  air  by  reason  of  the  weight  that  it  has  acquired  cannot  pour  itself 
into  the  other  air,  but  held  back  by  the  adhesiveness  of  the  water  with 
which  this  film  was  formed  falls  down  again  by  its  excess  of  weight, 
continually  growing  in  circumference,  because  the  amount  of  the  air 
which  at  first  was  in  the  whole  of  the  aforesaid  spherical  body  is  after- 
wards reduced  by  half,  and  this  is  of  itself  capable  of  containing  all 
this  air,  so  that  this  spherical  body  goes  on  descending  so  far  towards 
the  surface  of  the  water  that  it  unites  with  it,  finding  there  as  I  have 
said  before  greater  width  than  in  its  own  diametral  line. 

Nor  has  the  air  clothed  with  a  thin  film  of  water  perfect  sphericity 
in  the  aforesaid  instance,  because  the  part  of  the  water  with  which 
this  air  is  clothed,  is  heavier  where  it  is  more  perpendicular  to  the 
centre  of  the  circle,  which  makes  itself  the  base  of  this  half-sphere, 
and  therefore  in  this  position  it  lowers  itself  more;  because  that  part  of 
a  thing  supported  in  its  extremities  is  so  much  weaker  as  it  is  more 
distant  from  its  foundation,  and  that  thing  descends  more  rapidly 
which  has  the  weaker  support.  That  part  of  the  air  clothed  by  a  film 
of  water  will  be  of  most  perfect  sphericity  which  is  least  in  size;  this 
is  proved  by  the  reason  stated  above,  because  these  bodies  are  clothed 
with  films  of  equal  thickness:  for  if  the  air  that  escaped  from  the  sur- 
face of  the  water  was  small  in  amount  it  raised  up  a  small  quantity  of 
this  film,  and  clothed  itself  in  it;  and  since  its  lesser1  altitude  is  nearer 
its  foundation  than  was  that  of  a  greater,  it  maintains  itself  more  than 
this  greater.  The  air  which  is  subdued  by  the  weight  of  the  film  of 
water  which  clothes  it  penetrates  in  minute  particles  through  this  film, 
and  these,  for  the  reason  stated,  cannot  be  separated  from  their  state 
of  connection  or  adhesion  to  it,  and  therefore  through  the  weight  it 
has  thus  acquired  it  descends  from  the  sides  of  this  body,  and  remains

752  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

joined    to    the   base   of   the    middle    sphere    of   air    from    whence    it 
descended. 

It  breaks  the  middle  sphere  of  the  air  clothed  by  the  water  in  the 
third  part  of  its  curve;  this  is  proved  with  the  arches  of  walls,  and 
therefore  I  will  not  treat  of  it  in  these  notes,  but  I  will  place  it  in  the 
book  where  it  is  necessary. 

That  part  of  the  water  is  higher  which  is  more  remote  from  the 
centre  of  the  sphere  of  fire  and  of  the  air  and  of  the  water,  but  not  of 
the  earth,  because  this  has  not  a  mathematical  spherical  shape;  and 
for  this  reason  the  centre  of  its  gravity  is  not  concentric  with  the  centre 
of  the  spheres  of  the  other  three  elements. 

The  water  of  itself  does  not  move  unless  it  descends :  therefore,  when 
it  is  in  its  sphere  it  does  not  have  one  part  of  itself  lower  than  an- 
other, and  therefore  of  itself  it  will  not  move  unless  it  is  moved  by 
others:  and  the  two  aforesaid  proofs  are  sufficient  to  prove  that  water 
is  spherical  and  of  itself  without  movement;  and  as  a  consequence  all 
the  waters  that  move  of  themselves  are  lower  at  one  extremity  than  at 
the  other,  that  is  in  their  surface;  so  finding  the  descent  it  runs  there 
because  there  is  no  support  for  it  there. 

How  the  air  can  never  of  itself  remain  beneath  the  water  but  always 
wishes  to  be  above  in  its  contact:  in  proof  of  this  let  it  be  supposed  that 
there  are  three  elements  and  that  the  earth  is  nothing  and  that  one 
allows  a  quantity  of  water  to  fall  through  the  air;  this  cannot  stay 
above  the  air,  because  the  weaker  liquid  body  cannot  support  the 
heavier,  and  consequendy  the  air  since  it  is  a  body  thinner  than  the 
water  and  therefore  is  not  able  to  support  it  will  give  it  place;  and  this 
it  will  continue  to  do  until  the  water  has  reached  its  lowest  depth,  that 
is  assuming  that  it  has  not  become  evaporated  or  changed  into  air 
through  its  long  friction  with  the  air;  but  let  us  suppose  that  so  much 
turns  that  a  part  arrives  there:  I  say  that  after  consuming  its  impetus 
between  the  reflex  and  falling  movements  which  it  would  make 
around  its  centre  it  would  come  to  a  stop  at  this  centre  under  all  the 
sphere  of  air  equally,  because  the  centre  of  the  elements  is  the  lowest 
part  that  can  be  found  in  them,  since  the  lowest  is  that  part  which  is 
farthest  removed  from  the  greatest  height  of  its  whole.  This  is  the 
conception. 

Water  attracts  other  water  to  itself  when  it  touches  it :  this  is  proved 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  753 

from  the  bubble  formed  by  a  reed  with  water  and  soap,  because  the 
hole,  through  which  the  air  enters  there  into  the  body  and  enlarges  it, 
immediately  closes  when  the  bubble  is  separated  from  the  reed,  run- 
ning one  of  the  sides  of  its  lip  against  its  opposite  side,  and  joins  itself 
with  it  and  makes  it  firm. 

Also  a  small  drop  enters  into  the  body  of  the  other  water.  If  you 
should  grant  me  by  the  proof  of  these  bubbles  of  water  that  water  has 
tenacity  though  it  be  small  and  thin,  you  grant  me  that  that  which 
makes  the  part  will  make  its  whole. 

The  bubble  formed  within  the  air  by  a  reed,  through  which  it  is 
blown,  does  not  fall  in  spherical  shape,  when  it  becomes  detached  be- 
cause its  excess  of  water  runs  below  and  makes  it  heavier  there  than 
elsewhere,  and  consequently  the  movement  there  is  hurried,  and 
breaks  it  above  at  a  third.  Leic.  25  r. 

Every  current  has   three  central  lines,  which  are  situated   in  the 
middle  of  its  greatest  power :  of  these  one  is  at  the  contact  made  by  the 
water  with  the  bed  that  receives  it;  the  second  is  at  the  middle  of  its 
depth  and  width;  the  third  is  formed  on  the  surface;  but  that  of  the 
middle  is  the  principal  one  for  it  guides  the  whole  course  and  divides 
all  the  reflex  movements  and  turns  them  to  their  appointed  directions. 
The  higher  central  line  of  the  current  of  the  water  is  the  upper  line  of 
the  falling  movement,  and  the  lower  of  the  reflex  whirling  movement, 
that  is  that  which  turns  itself  over  and  falls  down  upon  the  falling 
movement  upon  which  it  takes  its  leap;  but  let  us  leave  the  revolutions 
of  the  waters  and  their  changes  from  below  upwards  as  far  as  con- 
cerns these  definitions,  and  speak  only  of  the  water  remaining  on  the 
surface,  that  is  as  far  as  concerns  its  central  lines.  The  central  line  of 
the  surface  of  the  current  is  always  in  the  most  prominent  part  of  the 
water  which  surrounds  the  object  struck  by  it;  and  the  central  line  is 
only  that  which  after  striking  upon  a  smooth-faced  object  falls  back 
upon  itself.  The  central  line  of  the  bottom  of  the  current  after  striking 
upon  the  smooth  object,  is  turned  over  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth, 
and  rambles  about  so  much  in  scraping  the  bed  that  it  makes  a  hollow 
large  enough  to  contain  its  revolutions;  and  all  the  other  lateral  lines 
slope  to  the  bed  and  hollow  it.  [To  consider]  whether  the  wave  of 
the  water  causes  the  formation  of  the  wave  of  sand  above  its  bed  or 


754  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

whether  the  wave  of  the  bed  is  the  cause  of  the  wave  on  the  surface  of 
the  water.  [To  consider  the]  difference  between  the  waves,  from 
knowing  their  depth:  which  may  always  be  discovered  between  the 
falling  and  the  reflex  movement  of  the  waters.  [To  consider]  how 
the  least  depth  within  the  banks  of  any  expanse  of  water  will  be 
found  at  the  end  of  its  reflex  movement.  How  also  the  least  depths  of 
rivers  will  be  found  at  the  sides  of  the  currents  where  they  unite  with 
other  currents.  [To  consider]  how  in  between  two  currents  there  are 
always  shallows.  The  highest  part  of  the  surface  of  the  water  that 
strikes  the  object  will  strike  it  in  its  centre  if  it  be  of  smooth  front 
or  pointed  with  sides  of  equal  slant  and  length.  But  unless  the  angle  is 
in  the  middle  of  the  front  of  the  object  the  highest  elevation  of  the 
wave  that  strikes  it  will  no  longer  be  in  the  centre  of  this  front  but 
opposite  to  the  aforesaid  angle.  The  water  of  the  surface  that  is  moved 
in  tiny  ripples  by  the  wind,  always  moves  so  much  more  swiftly  than 
the  wave  of  the  water,  in  proportion  as  the  wave  is  swifter  than  the 
natural  movement  of  the  water,  and  as  the  natural  movement  of  the 
water  is  swifter  than  the  wave  of  the  sand,  and  as  the  wave  of  the 
sand  is  swifter  than  the  wave  of  the  earth  that  forms  the  river  bank. 
But  I  ought  first  to  say  that  the  movement  of  the  free  air  is  so  much 
swifter  than  the  movement  of  the  air  that  strikes  the  water,  because 
that  part  of  the  wind  that  strikes  the  water  is  checked  by  the  resistance 
of  the  surface  of  the  water.  All  the  waves  of  the  sand  which  travel 
with  the  water  are  as  much  slower  than  the  waves  of  the  sand  that 
travel  with  the  wind  as  the  movement  of  the  water  is  slower  than  the 
movement  of  the  wind.  Leic.  25  v. 

In  these  eight  sheets  there  are  seven  hundred  and  thirty  conclusions 
as  to  water. 

When  the  wave  has  been  driven  on  to  the  shore  by  the  force  of  the 
wind  it  forms  a  mound  by  putting  its  upper  part  at  the  bottom,  and 
turns  back  on  this  until  it  reaches  the  spot  where  it  is  beaten  back  anew 
by  the  succeeding  wave  which  comes  below  it  and  turns  it  over  on  its 
back,  and  so  overthrows  the  mound  and  beats  it  back  again  on  the 
shore  mentioned  before;  and  so  continues  time  after  time;  turning 
now  to  the  shore  with  its  upper  movement  and  now  with  its  lower 
fleeing  away  from  it. 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  755 

How  it  is  Dot  possible  to  describe  the  process  of  the  movement  of 
water  unless  one  first  defines  what  gravity  is  and  how  it  is  created  or 
dies. 

As  the  wave  after  striking  on  the  sea  shore  turns  back  along  the 
bed  of  the  sea  behind  its  mound,  it  encounters  the  following  wave 
which  comes  from  the  high  sea,  and  breaks  itself  upon  it  and  divides 
itself;  part  leaping  towards  the  sky  and  then  falling  down  and  turn- 
ing back,  part  towards  the  bed  of  the  sea;  and  this  continues  towards 
the  sea,  carrying  with  it  the  lower  part  of  the  water  that  struck  upon 
it.  Were  it  not  for  it  doing  thus  the  seaweed  and  the  wrack  of  the 
tempests  would  not  be  able  to  be  carried  from  one  shore  and  deposited 
upon  another.  If  the  water  of  the  sea  turns  towards  the  sea  above  its 
bed  after  the  percussion  made  upon  its  shore,  how  can  it  carry  with 
it  the  shells,  molluscs,  'buovoli',  snails  and  other  similar  things  pro- 
duced in  the  bed  of  the  sea,  and  throw  them  upon  this  shore?  This 
movement  of  the  aforesaid  things  towards  the  shore  commences  when 
the  percussion  of  the  falling  wave  divides  the  reflex  wave  into  the 
aforesaid  two  parts,  for  the  things  raised  from  the  bottom  often  leap 
up  in  the  wave  that  returns  to  the  shore,  and  being  solid  bodies  are 
driven  towards  the  mound,  which  then  draws  them  back  with  it 
towards  the  sea;  and  so  continues  in  succession  until  the  storm  begins 
to  abate,  and  stage  by  stage  it  leaves  them  where  the  greater  wave 
reaches,  that  is  that  as  the  succeeding  wave  does  not  return  to  the 
same  mark  where  it  had  deposited  the  booty  that  it  carried,  this  booty 
remains  where  it  has  been  left  by  the  wave;  and  this  process  continues 
as  the  waves  grow  less.  There  remain  the  things  cast  up  by  the  sea 
within  the  space  that  lies  between  the  first  mound  of  the  wave  upon 
the  shore  and  the  mound  made  by  the  wave  that  comes  from  the  deep 
sea.  If  the  whole  sea  rests  and  supports  itself  upon  its  bed  the  part  of 
the  sea  rests  upon  the  part  of  the  bed:  and  as  water  possesses  gravity 
when  out  of  its  element  it  ought  to  weigh  down  and  press  upon  the 
things  that  rest  on  its  bed.  But  we  see  the  contrary,  for  there  the  sea- 
weed and  grass  that  grows  in  these  depths  are  not  bent  or  crushed 
upon  the  bottom  but  cleave  it  directly  as  though  they  were  growing 
within  the  air. 

So  we  arrive  at  the  conclusion  that  all  the  elements,  though  they  are 
without  weight  in  their  own  sphere,  possess  weight  away  from  their 


756  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

sphere,  that  is  away  towards  the  sky,  but  not  away  towards  the  centre 
of  the  earth;  because  if  it  proceeds  away  towards  this  centre  it  finds 
an  element  heavier  than  itself,  with  its  thinnest  and  lightest  part  touch- 
ing an  element  lighter  than  itself,  and  the  heavier  part  of  the  element 
is  so  placed  as  to  be  near  the  element  that  is  heavier  than  itself. 

How  water  when  transformed  becomes  changed  into  wind  which  is 
so  much  drier  as  the  process  of  transformation  is  more  complete. 

How  wind  is  generated  by  the  coagulation  of  the  water  within  the 
air,  for  the  air  hastens  to  where  there  is  a  lack  of  it,  and  so  it  flees  from 
where  it  is  in  excess.  How  the  air  has  a  greater  volume  where  there  is 
more  wind,  because  the  air  there  is  thicker. 

How  the  winds  are  strongest  in  the  moist  seasons,  and  more  so  in 
the  rains  than  in  clear  weather.  How  great  winds  proceed  from  the 
mountains  that  are  covered  with  snow;  and  to  this  the  sailors  bear  wit- 
ness for  they  experience  it  every  day.  And  this  is  brought  about 
through  the  fact  of  the  snow  becoming  dissolved  in  the  air,  and  being 
dissolved  in  very  fine  particles;  hence  philosophers  say  that  there  are 
dry  land  vapours;  as  to  which  I  have  nothing  to  say. 

How  the  wind,  proceeding  from  the  cloud,  is  not  exhaled  in  a  circle 
through  every  line  away  from  the  cloud,  because  it  acquires  more 
weight  than  the  air  through  which  it  passes,  and  so  of  necessity  is  bent 
to  the  ground  as  are  all  the  things  that  are  heavier  than  the  air,  and  it 
rambles  through  it,  driven  by  that  which  follows,  which  is  created 
behind  it,  or  by  the  impetus  it  has  acquired  from  its  past  movement. 

Leic.  26  v. 

That  water  may  have  tenacity  and  cohesion  together  is  quite  clearly 
shown  in  small  quantities  of  water,  where  the  drop,  in  the  process  of 
separating  itself  from  the  rest,  before  it  falls  becomes  as  elongated  as 
possible,  until  the  weight  of  the  drop  renders  the  tenacity  by  which 
it  is  suspended  so  thin  that  this  tenacity,  overcome  by  the  excessive 
weight,  suddenly  yields  and  breaks  and  becomes  separated  from  the 
aforesaid  drop,  and  returns  upwards  contrary  to  the  natural  course  of 
its  gravity,  nor  does  it  move  from  there  any  more  until  it  is  again 
driven  down  by  the  weight  which  has  been  reformed.  From  this  prop- 
osition two  conclusions  follow,  of  which  the  first  is  that  the  drop  has 
cohesion  and  nerve-structure  in  common  with  the  water  with  which 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  757 

it  is  joined;  secondly  that  the  water  drawn  by  force  breaks  its  co- 
hesion, and  the  part  that  extends  to  the  break  is  drawn  up  by  the 
remainder  in  the  same  manner  as  is  the  iron  by  the  magnet.  The  same 
is  seen  with  water  passing  through  a  filter,  for  the  greater  weight  of 
the  water  that  is  outside  the  vessel  draws  back  the  lesser  weight  of  the 
water  which  this  filter  holds  back  curved  within  the  vessel. 

One  may  offer  a  proof  of  the  tenacity  of  water  and  set  it  out  in 
proportion,  thus: — if  a  drop  of  water  of  two  grains  is  supported  by 
water  of  the  volume  of  half  a  drop  by  how  much  will  a  pound  be  sup- 
ported? And  in  this  way  we  shall  arrive  near  the  truth.  The  sand 
weighs  more  than  the  water;  and  if  there  be  left  within  the  air  in 
continuous  line  a  quantity  of  sand  and  a  quantity  of  water,  separated 
from  the  sand  but  of  the  same  weight  as  the  sand,  without  doubt  the 
movement  of  the  sand  will  be  slower  than  that  of  the  water;  and  this 
comes  about  because  the  lower  part  of  the  water  draws  down  the 
water  that  is  joined  to  it  above,  and  consequently  it  makes  itself  all 
one  body  and  weighs  all  together  upon  the  air,  which  opens  below  to 
give  it  place.  This  does  not  happen  however  with  the  sand,  for  in  itself 
it  is  all  separated  and  loose,  and  the  whole  of  the  amount  falls  with 
the  same  speed  that  one  of  its  grains  would,  as  they  are  all  equal.  So 
that  we  may  conclude  that  the  continuous  descent  of  the  water  as  it 
falls  through  the  air  proceeds  with  the  speed  that  its  weight  requires, 
because  it  is  a  united  and  continuous  quantity;  and  the  sand  of  the 
same  weight  which  descends  from  the  same  position  of  the  water  only 
proceeds  with  as  much  speed  as  is  required  by  the  weight  of  one  of 
its  medium-sized  grains,  for  those  that  are  larger  descend  more  swiftly 
than  those  of  medium  size,  and  the  less  descend  more  slowly. 

For  if  water  has  in  itself  adhesiveness  and  a  tendency  to  unite,  the 
water  that  is  poured  from  a  siphon,  being  surrounded  by  air,  does  not 
draw  itself  after  that  of  the  siphon;  and  experience  shows  us  that  un- 
less the  outlet  of  the  water  of  the  siphon  is  lower  than  its  entrance  into 
the  pipe,  the  water  that  continues  below  its  outlet  from  the  pipe  will 
never  draw  itself  after  that  of  the  vessel.  If  in  the  descent  of  the  water 
within  the  air  the  water  above,  which  drives  it  downwards,  does  not 
descend  there  with  the  same  speed  or  a  greater,  that  below  will  divide 
itself  from  that  above,  if  it  is  swifter. 

How  the  water  that  descends  through  the  air  breaks  because  the 


758  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

air  through  which  it  passes  divides  it.  How  the  water  which  is  di- 
vided as  it  descends  continuously  through  the  air  has  a  medium  of 
spray,  which  extends  from  one  divided  part  to  the  other,  and  binds 
them  up  together.  How  all  the  volume  of  the  water  which  descends 
through  the  air  in  continuous  quantities,  is  constrained  to  descend 
with  equal  movement,  because  where  it  made  itself  swifter  it  would 
separate  itself  from  the  part  that  was  slower,  and  where  it  made  itself 
slower  it  would  be  doubled  and  multiplied  by  the  part  that  was 
swifter.  How  as  great  a  weight  of  water  is  displaced  as  the  weight  of 
the  thing  that  is  supported  by  this  water.  How  in  the  same  slant,  the 
water  will  make  itself  so  much  slower  in  its  movement  as  it  is  lower 
upon  its  bed.  How  water  made  to  gyrate  in  swift  movement  in  a 
vessel  by  the  hands  of  him  who  is  whirling  it  round  becomes  extremely 
concave  at  the  centre. 

Of  the  great  difference  there  is  when  water  is  whirled  in  a  vessel, 
according  to  whether  the  hand  is  held  near  to  the  centre  of  this  vessel 
or  near  the  larger  circle  of  the  surface  of  the  water.  How  the  hand 
drawn  frequently  across  the  vessel  up  and  down  produces  strange 
movements  and  surfaces  of  different  heights.  What  water  does  when 
made  to  gyrate  in  an  oval  vessel.  What  water  does  when  made  to  gyrate 
in  a  vessel  with  corners.  What  water  does  in  a  vessel  that  is  struck 
from  below.  What  water  does  in  a  vessel  that  is  struck  at  the  side. 
What  water  does  in  a  vessel  when  the  spot  is  struck  on  which  it  is 
standing.

How  nothing  evaporates  except  by  means  of  moisture,  which  after 
having  been  evaporated  preserves  in  itself  the  nature  of  the  body  in 
which  it  was  infused.  How  the  rumbling  produced  by  the  earthquake 
in  the  body  of  the  earth  proceeds  from  the  destruction  of  places,  torn 
open  by  force  by  the  winds  which  continually  strike  upon  the  beds  of 
their  great  caverns  or  lakes,  covered  and  shut  in  within  the  earth. 

But  the  tempest  of  the  sea,  snatched  from  its  shores  and  borne  far 
over  the  sea  will  be  turned  back,  and  especially  if  there  is  great  depth 
there;  and  this  happens  because  during  a  storm  the  wave  of  the  sea 
does  not  penetrate  to  its  great  depths;  and  if  it  should  chance  to  reach 
there  it  changes  its  movement.  The  water  of  the  sea  during  a  storm 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  759 

makes  a  great  movement  on  its  bed  in  a  different  direction  from  that 
of  its  surface. 

The  dams  of  rivers  if  not  of  too  great  width  may  be  made  in  this 
manner:  a  stake  such  as  pile-drivers  use  should  be  fixed  every  three 
braccia,  as  big  as  possible  and  the  bigger  the  better;  and  their  tops 
should  be  of  uniform  height.  On  these  a  log  of  the  shape  of  a  beam 
should  be  fastened  very  firmly;  next  long  trunks  with  all  their 
branches  should  be  taken  and  laid  upon  the  aforesaid  beam,  and  they 
should  be  fastened  to  it  by  using  one  of  the  branches  as  a  hook;  and 
this  process  should  be  repeated  as  often  as  possible,  placing  the  branches 
towards  the  coming  of  the  water;  and  they  should  then  be  loaded  with 
shingle  and  stones;  and  after  the  first  flood  it  is  left  grounded.  But 
remember  to  fix  the  branches  so  that  they  are  raised  up  and  make 
them  fall  with  the  others.  And  if  the  river  should  be  narrow  you  set 
the  beam  across  from  one  bank  to  the  other  and  fix  it  well;  and  set 
the  aforesaid  branches  to  lean  upon  it  fastened  with  their  natural  hooks. 
The  beam  here  is  only  for  the  purpose  of  holding  the  heads  of  the  logs 
so  that  they  do  not  drop  down;  and  the  branches  which  stand  against 
the  course  of  the  river  laden  with  stones,  are  not  allowed  to  push  this 
beam  or  bend  its  direction  because  it  is  held  by  their  natural  hooks, 
and  their  buried  branches  do  not  allow  them  to  move  or  to  tear  away 
the  said  hooks. 

How  the  diverting  of  rivers  ought  to  be  carried  on  when  the  water 
has  completely  lost  the  fury  of  its  current,  that  is  when  it  shows  itself 
tired.  How  with  a  small  dam  a  river  may  be  diverted  by  aiding  and 
increasing  the  line  where  it  shows  that  it  wishes  to  turn  of  itself. 

How  a  river  may  be  diverted  by  a  few  stones  if  one  understands  the 
line  of  its  current;  and  this  movement  may  be  made  in  the  aforesaid 
line  of  the  water.  How  the  dams  of  the  river  should  never  be  formed 
by  placing  stakes  in  deep  places  but  in  the  more  shallow  places.  How 
the  dams  of  the  rivers  when  formed  of  masonry  ought  to  be  con- 
structed in  the  deepest  parts  of  the  rivers,  so  that  they  may  be  less  in 
the  power  of  the  water  which  undermines  them.  How  the  dams  of  the 
rivers  ought  to  be  made  in  the  fields  away  from  the  rivers  and  then 
the  said  river  be  directed  against  them.  How  the  bridges  ought  also 
to  be  made  in  the  fields  in  that  part  where  it  is  afterwards  intended 
to  direct  the  river.  Leic.  27  v. 


760  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

The  ramifications  of  the  springs  of  water  are  all  joined  together  in 
this  earth,  as  are  those  of  the  blood  in  other  animals;  and  they  are  in 
continual  revolution,  and  thus  vivified  they  are  perpetually  wear- 
ing away  the  places  in  which  they  move,  both  those  within  the  earth 
and  those  on  the  surface  of  it;  and  the  rivers  universally  pour  out 
much  more  water  now  than  formerly:  for  which  reason  the  surface  of 
the  sea  is  somewhat  lowered  towards  the  centre  of  the  world  as  it  has 
had  to  fill  up  the  vacuum  caused  by  this  increase  in  these  springs;  of 
which  I  shall  speak  presently.  The  heat  of  the  fire  generated  within 
the  body  of  the  earth  warms  the  waters  which  are  pent  up  within  it 
in  the  great  caverns  and  other  hollow  places;  and  this  heat  causes 
these  waters  to  boil  and  pass  into  vapour  and  raise  themselves  up  to 
the  roofs  of  the  said  caverns,  and  penetrate  through  the  crevices  in  the 
mountains  up  to  their  greatest  height,  where  coming  upon  the  cold  it 
is  suddenly  changed  into  water,  as  one  sees  happen  in  a  retort,  and 
goes  falling  down  again  and  forming  the  beginnings  of  rivers  which 
are  afterwards  seen  descending  from  them.  But  when  the  great  frosts 
drive  back  the  heat  towards  the  centre  of  the  world,  this  heat  becomes 
more  powerful  and  causes  a  greater  vaporisation  of  the  aforesaid  water; 
and  this  vapour  heating  the  caverns  round  which  it  moves  in  circles 
cannot  form  itself  into  water  as  it  usually  does :  as  is  seen  in  the  mak- 
ing of  aqua  vitae,  for  unless  the  vapour  of  the  wine  passed  through 
fresh  water  it  would  not  change  into  aqua  vitae,  but  would  go  back 
and  become  at  last  so  much  condensed  as  to  break  down  every  obstacle. 
We  may  say  the  same  of  water  heated  in  the  bowels  of  the  earth, 
which  not  finding  in  its  passage  places  of  such  freshness  as  harmonises 
with  it,  does  not  form  itself  into  water  as  formerly,  but  condenses 
and  hardens  like  fire  multiplied  and  condensed  within  a  mortar, 
which  becomes  harder  and  more  powerful  than  the  substance  that  con- 
tains it,  and  so  unless  it  be  suddenly  dissolved  in  smoke  it  instantly 
hurls  itself  forward,  breaking  and  destroying  whatever  opposes  its 
growth.  It  is  the  same  with  the  aforesaid  steam  from  the  water,  for  it 
bursts  forth  within  the  bowels  of  the  earth  in  divers  places;  ranging 
about  and  roaring  with  great  tumult  until  it  reaches  the  surface;  and 
with  a  mighty  earthquake  makes  whole  regions  tremble,  and  often 
makes  mountains  fall  in  ruin,  and  lays  waste  cities  and  lands  in  divers 
parts,  and  with  a  mighty  hurricane  bursts  its  way  forth  through  the 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  761 

cracks  in  the  earth  which  it  has  made;  and  so  by  thus  escaping  it  con- 
sumes  its  own  might.  The  wind  is  formed  by  the  water  in  the  air 
through  the  processes  of  the  dissolving  and  the  formation  of  clouds; 
that  is  that  when  the  cloud  is  dissolved  it  becomes  changed  into  air 
and  increases  in  its  bulk  fitfully  and  irregularly,  since  the  process  of 
its  dissolution  does  not  work  uniformly;  because  the  cloud  is  in  itself 
of  varying  thinness  and  density,  consequently  the  part  that  is  thinnest 
is  dissolved  most  rapidly,  and  the  thick  part  offers  most  resistance  to 
this  process:  this  therefore  is  the  cause  why  the  movement  of  this 
wind  does  not  proceed  uniformly. 

And  when  the  cloud  is  created  it  also  generates  wind,  since  every 
movement  is  created  from  excess  or  scarcity;  therefore  in  the  creation 
of  the  cloud  it  attracts  to  itself  the  surrounding  air,  and  so  becomes 
condensed,  because  the  damp  air  was  drawn  from  the  warm  into  the 
cold  region  which  lies  above  the  clouds;  consequently  as  it  has  to  make 
water  from  air  which  was  at  first  swollen  by  it,  it  is  necessary  for  a 
great  quantity  of  air  to  rush  together  in  order  to  create  the  cloud; 
and  since  it  cannot  make  a  vacuum,  the  air  rushes  in  to  fill  up  with 
itself  the  space  that  has  been  left  by  the  [former]  air,  which  was  first 
condensed  and  then  transformed  into  a  dense  cloud.  In  this  circum- 
stance the  wind  rushes  through  the  air,  and  does  not  touch  the  earth, 
except  on  the  summits  of  the  high  mountains;  it  cannot  draw  the  air 
from  the  earth,  because  there  would  then  be  a  vacuum  between  the 
earth  and  the  cloud;  and  it  draws  but  little  air  through  the  traverse 
and  draws  it  more  abundantly  through  every  line.  I  have  already  had 
an  opportunity  of  observing  this  process;  and  on  one  occasion  above 
Milan,  over  in  the  direction  of  Lake  Maggiore,  I  saw  a  cloud  shaped 
like  a  huge  mountain,  made  up  of  banks  of  fire,  because  the  rays  of 
the  sun  which  was  then  setting  red  on  the  horizon  had  dyed  it  with 
their  colour. 

This  great  cloud  drew  to  itself  all  the  little  clouds  which  were  round 
about  it.  And  the  great  cloud  remained  stationary,  and  it  retained  the 
light  of  the  sun  on  its  apex  for  an  hour  and  a  half  after  sunset,  so 
enormous  was  its  size.  And  about  two  hours  after  night  had  fallen 
there  arose  a  stupendous  storm  of  wind. 

And  this,  as  it  became  closed  up,  caused  the  air  which  was  pent  up 
within  it,  being  compressed  by  the  condensation  of  the  cloud,  to  burst 


762  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

through  and  escape  by  the  weakest  part,  rushing  through  the  air  with 
incessant  tumult,  acting  in  the  same  way  as  a  sponge  when  squeezed 
by  the  hand  underneath  the  water,  for  the  water  with  which  it  is 
soaked  escapes  between  the  ringers  of  the  hand  that  squeezes  it,  and 
rushes  swiftly  through  the  other  water.  So  it  is  with  the  cloud,  driven 
back  and  compressed  by  the  cold  that  clothes  it  round,  driving  away 
the  air  with  its  own  impetus,  and  striking  it  through  the  other  air, 
until  the  heat  that  is  mingled  with  the  moisture  of  the  cloud  that  has 
drawn  it  to  so  great  a  height  flies  back  towards  the  centre  of  the  cloud, 
escaping  the  cold  which  is  its  contrary,  and  having  approached  towards 
the  centre  becomes  powerful,  and  consequently  takes  fire  and  makes 
a  sudden  emission  of  damp  steam,  which  surrounds  it  and  creates  a 
furious  wind  that  moves  with  the  fire  thrown  out  by  the  increasing 
pressure  of  the  steam;  and  thus  fire  is  expelled  from  the  cloud  as  is 
the  flame  from  the  mortar,  by  the  wind  increasing  behind  it;  and  so 
this  flame  compressed  by  the  cloud  issues  forth,  and  spreads  through 
the  air,  with  the  more  radiance  in  proportion  as  the  fire  of  which  it 
is  formed  is  more  concentrated  and  of  greater  heat:  and  this  is  the 
thunderbolt  which  afterwards  ruins  and  smashes  in  pieces  whatever 
opposes  its  destined  course. 

I  have  already  seen  fire  created  under  the  water  with  the  movement 
of  a  wheel  which  whirled  its  arms;  and  it  will  do  the  same  at  any 
depth  however  great. 

If  the  river  be  turned  at  the  upheaval  of  the  earthquake,  it  will  no 
longer  run  forwards  but  will  return  into  the  body  of  the  earth,  as  does 
the  river  Euphrates;  and  let  this  serve  for  any  of  those  at  Bologna 
who  lament  over  their  rivers.  Leic.  28  r. 

That  water  will  rise  higher  with  its  wave  than  the  common  surface 
of  the  water  of  the  lake,  when  it  is  nearer  the  spot  at  which  it  falls 
into  the  lake.  When  the  waters  from  different  parts  meet  together  in 
a  hole  that  is  in  the  bed  of  the  river  this  water  will  be  bored  through 
as  far  as  the  entrance  of  the  hole,  and  the  cavity  so  made  will  be  filled 
with  air  as  far  as  the  bed  of  the  water. 

The  revolving  movement  cannot  be  continued  strictly  below  the 
water  unless  this  revolving  mass  of  water  has  air  in  the  middle  of  it. 
That  water  will  form  a  sudden  hollow  in  its  bank  of  earth  which 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  763 

strikes  within  equal  angles  at  any  object  that  projects  from  this  bank. 
The  rain  that  parts  from  the  cloud  does  not  all  fall  on  the  earth:  this 
is  clue  to  its  friction  with  the  air  that  it  penetrates,  because  in  the 
course  of  this  friction  it  becomes  consumed  either  altogether  or  in  great 
part  and  pours  itself  into  the  above-mentioned  air;  and  often  one  sees 
the  clouds  descend  towards  the  earth  and  immediately  become  cut 
short  in  the  manner  of  a  horse's  tail  and  remain  invisible;  and  they 
are  changed  into  wind.  Leic.  28  v. 

Where  the  straight  course  of  the  water  is  impeded,  there  sudden 
depth  will  be  produced.  This  occurs  because  when  the  course  of  the 
water  is  impeded  it  is  making  percussion  against  an  obstacle  that  im- 
pedes it,  and  because  no  movable  thing  can  immediately  end  and 
consume  its  impetus,  but  it  must  be  retained  by  the  body  which  it  pene- 
trates; and  also  it  does  not  end  in  this  immediately  after  the  percus- 
sion, seeing  that  every  percussion  is  made  upon  the  surfaces  of  the 
bodies  which  are  struck;  therefore,  the  penetration  of  movable  things 
within  their  objects  is  a  consequence  born  after  their  percussion,  in 
which  the  impetus  of  the  movement  is  consumed. 

The  penetration  of  the  movable  things  within  their  objects  will  be 
of  as  much  less  length  than  their  reflex  movement  made  in  the  same 
space  of  the  falling  movement,  as  the  thing  penetrated  is  thicker  than 
the  medium,  where  this  reflex  movement  is  made.  Now  the  water 
when  its  straight  movement  is  impeded  strikes  the  object  that  impedes 
it,  and  immediately,  not  being  able  to  penetrate  it,  is  reflected  at  almost 
equal  angles;  after  which  percussion  it  divides  and  escapes  by  different 
lines  from  the  spot  where  it  struck;  of  these  that  which  raises  itself 
in  the  air  acquires  weight,  and  falls  back  and  penetrates  the  other 
water  as  a  heavy  thing;  after  which  it  strikes  and  consumes  the  bed 
of  the  river;  but  in  the  process  of  penetration  it  is  struck  by  the  water 
which  flows  beneath  its  surface,  and  from  stage  to  stage  is  driven  back 
in  threefold  movement  towards  the  place  where  it  first  struck. 

There  are  three  positions  of  the  movement  that  the  water  makes  on 
being  reflected  from  its  percussion  within  the  water  penetrated  by  it: 
the  first  movement  is  towards  the  bed  of  the  water;  the  second  is  to- 
wards the  place  where  the  water  is  moving;  the  third  is  whirling 
movement  after  the  manner  of  a  screw,  boring  continually  the  bank 


764  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

and  the  bed  on  which  it  rubs,  and  always  gathering  fresh  force  from 
the  water  that  follows  in  succession,  thrown  back  from  the  bank, 
which  descends  upon  it  from  the  air,  and  resubmerges  it  anew  with 
itself  at  the  bottom. 

Here  then  is  a  percussion,  and  the  movable  thing  after  having  struck 
the  object  remains  in  the  position  where  it  was  when  it  made  the  per- 
cussion; and  the  object  struck  follows  the  same  line  and  extent  of  the 
course  of  which  the  striker  was  deprived.  This  happens  because  in  this 
instance  the  weights  are  equal  in  size,  weight  and  substance,  and  to  the 
weight  of  the  movable  thing  has  been  joined  the  power  of  the  impetus 
of  which  the  object  was  deprived,  and  it  only  rested  with  its  natural 
weight;  this  is  so,  because  no  impetus  is  consumed  immediately,  and 
because  the  body  that  strikes  is  accustomed  to  make  the  reflex  move- 
ment when  it  finds  an  object  that  offers  resistance;  but  here  reflex 
movement  is  not  produced,  because  the  object  immediately  flies  away, 
bearing  with  it  the  power  and  impetus  of  its  striker;  and  because 
always  the  movable  thing,  which  does  not  attach  itself  to  its  object,  is 
accustomed  to  finish  the  remainder  of  its  destined  movement  in  the 
reflex  movement,  which  starts  immediately  it  has  finished  its  percus- 
sion. Here  they  do  not  become  fixed,  because  they  are  of  spherical 
body  and  of  equal  substance.  It  does  not  advance  farther  because  it  has 
exhausted  its  impetus  in  its  percussion,  and  has  given  it  to  the  object 
struck;  it  does  not  spring  back,  for  it  has  nothing  to  serve  as  a  founda- 
tion for  its  spring,  after  the  manner  of  a  man  who  wishes  to  jump 
from  a  board  which  is  placed  on  the  pavement  on  top  of  several  pieces 
of  a  beam  which  has  been  sawn  up;  for  as  he  gathers  impetus  for  the 
leap,  this  impetus  communicates  itself  to  and  unites  with  the  board 
which  flies  away  as  though  upon  wheels;  and  he  who  would  fain  leap 
deprived  of  the  impetus  of  the  leap,  is  left  in  the  same  position  in 
which  he  was  when  he  formed  the  intention  of  leaping;  so  that  from 
this  we  may  conclude  that  the  impetus  can  be  immediately  separated 
from  the  body  where  it  was  created  and  pour  itself  into  the  object 
which  it  has  struck. 

But  if  the  body  struck  be  lighter  than  its  striker,  the  length  of  the 
movement  destined  for  this  striker  will  be  as  much  shorter  as  the 
impetus  which  is  divided  from  it,  attaching  itself  to  the  body  struck,  is 
diminished.  That  is,  if  the  body  struck  was  a  pound  and  the  striker 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  765 

two  pounds,  I  affirm  that  the  percussion  will  take  away  half  the  im- 
petus and  the  movement  of  its  striker,  and  the  body  struck  having 
only  half  the  power  of  impetus  will  take  a  medium  course,  but  so 
much  more  than  that  made  by  the  striker  which  follows  it  as  it  is 
lighter  than  it,  and  there  is  less  resistance  of  air;  excepting  the  power 
of  the  resistance  of  the  air  which  is  measured  by  drawing  the  same 
movable  thing  with  double  power;  and  if  the  movements  are  not  of 
double  length,  that  which  is  lacking  has  been  taken  away  from  them 
by  the  resistance  of  the  air,  which  may  be  said  to  resist  in  the  same 
proportion  as  the  aforesaid  movable  thing  is  lacking  in  movement 
when  driven  by  double  the  power  there  was  at  first.  And  if  the  object 
struck  was  much  lighter  than  the  striker,  the  air  will  offer  much 
resistance  to  the  movement  of  the  body  struck.  And  if  the  body  struck 
is  double  the  body  that  strikes  it,  its  movement  will  be  in  the  sub- 
duplicate  ratio  of  the  reflex  movement  of  its  striker.  And  if  the  bodies 
which  strike  are  equal  and  similar  and  of  equal  movement  and  power, 
then  their  reflex  movements  will  be  equal  in  length  and  power.  But  if 
the  movement  of  similar  and  equal  bodies  be  unequal  then  their  reflex 
movement  will  be  unequal.  Leic.  29  r. 


OF  THE  VORTICES  OR  EDDIES  WHICH  THE  AIR  MAKES 

IN  WATER 

It  often  happens  that  when  one  wind  meets  another  at  an  obtuse 
angle,  these  same  winds  circle  round  together  and  twine  themselves 
together  into  the  shape  of  a  huge  column,  and  becoming  thus  con- 
densed the  air  acquires  weight.  I  once  saw  such  a  hollow  column 
assume  the  shape  of  a  man  above  the  sand  of  the  sea  shore,  where 
these  winds  were  ranging  round  together  and  digging  stones  of  a  con- 
siderable size  from  this  hollow,  and  carrying  sand  and  seaweed  through 
the  air  for  the  space  of  a  mile  and  dropping  them  in  the  water,  whirl- 
ing them  round  and  transforming  them  to  a  dense  column  which 
formed  dark  thick  clouds  at  its  upper  extremity;  and  beyond  the  sum- 
mits of  the  mountains  these  clouds  were  scattered  and  followed  the 
direct  course  of  the  wind  when  it  was  no  longer  impeded  by  the 
mountains. 


j66  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

\0f  the  movement  of  water] 

That  thing  is  lower  which  is  nearer  to  the  centre  of  the  earth;  there- 
fore that  will  be  higher  which  is  more  remote  from  this  centre. 

Every  quantity  of  water  will  move  towards  its  lower  extremity;  and 
where  these  extremities  are  of  equal  height,  this  water  will  not  in  itself 
have  any  movement. 

Here  it  is  proved  by  these  two  propositions  that  the  waters  of  the 
seas  which  are  contingent  will  never  of  themselves  have  movement; 
and  how  of  necessity  they  are  of  spherical  surface. 

Therefore  water  that  moves  of  itself  has  one  of  its  extremities  lower 
than  the  others;  and  that  which  does  not  move  is  of  the  same  height 
in  its  extremities. 

A  corollary  follows  which  says  that  water  does  not  move  of  itself 
unless  it  descends.  Leic.  30  v. 

The  variety  of  the  positions  and  rates  of  speed  of  the  waters  within 
their  rivers  is  caused  by  the  variety  of  the  slant  of  their  bed.  The 
variety  of  the  slant  of  the  beds  of  rivers  is  caused  by  the  variety  of  the 
swiftness  of  the  current  of  the  waters. 

Water  of  itself  does  not  move  unless  the  slant  of  the  bed  draws  it  to 
itself:  what  therefore  was  the  cause  of  this  slant  of  the  bed  different 
from  its  first  general  slant?  For  I  allow  myself  to  understand  that  the 
movements  more  or  less  of  the  waters  in  the  rivers  were  caused  only 
by  the  greater  and  less  slants  of  the  beds,  as  I  have  set  forth  above. 

And  if  the  first  bed  of  the  river  was  formed  with  uniform  width, 
slant  and  straightness,  what  was  the  cause  of  the  varying  of  such  con- 
ditions as  regards  the  bed?  For  it  is  here  shown  that  the  water  which 
moves  above  them  must  of  necessity  be  of  uniform  current.  The  mat- 
ter which  makes  the  water  of  the  rivers  turbid  is  that  which  after 
being  carried  some  distance  settles  upon  their  beds,  and  raises  them, 
and  changes  the  slant  of  the  bed;  and  in  this  way  it  causes  the  varia- 
tion in  the  courses  of  the  waters.  And  from  this  we  conclude  that  the 
water  is  the  cause  of  the  variation  of  its  bed,  and  that  the  bed  then  of 
necessity  changes  the  courses  of  the  waters  in  greater  or  less  speed; 
which  variety  of  courses  is  then  the  most  powerful  cause  of  varying 
.ill  the  bed  of  its  river;  and  so  it  is  concluded: — The  bed  of  the  rivers 
is  varied  by  the  matter  that  the  course  of  the  water  deposits  there; 


THE  NATURE  OF  WATER  76; 

and  the  variety  in  the  course  of  the  waters  is  further  varied  by  the 
irregularity  in  the  bed  of  the  river. 

A  drop  of  water  that  falls  in  a  place  of  uniform  density  and  smooth- 
ness will  splash  in  such  a  way  that  the  edges  of  its  mark  will  be  at  an 
equal  distance  from  its  circumference;  and  so  conversely  if  it  should 
not  fall  in  a  level  place.  Leic.  33  r. 

The  centres  of  the  sphericity  of  water  are  two:  the  one  is  of  the 
universal  watery  sphere,  the  other  of  the  particular. 

That  of  the  universal  is  that  which  serves  for  all  the  waters  that  are 
without  movement,  which  are  in  themselves  in  great  quantity  such  as 
canals,  ditches,  ponds,  fountains,  wells,  stagnant  rivers,  lakes,  marshes, 
swamps  and  seas;  for  these  although  of  different  depth  in  themselves 
have  the  boundaries  of  their  surfaces  equidistant  from  the  centre  of 
the  world,  as  are  the  lakes  situated  at  the  tops  of  high  mountains,  as 
above  Pietra  Pana  and  the  lake  of  the  Sybil  at  Norcia,  and  all  the 
lakes  which  form  the  sources  of  great  rivers,  as  the  Ticino  from  Lake 
Maggiore;  the  Adda  from  Lake  Como;  the  Mincio  from  Lake  Garda; 
and  the  Rhine  from  Lake  Constance  and  Coire,  and  from  the  lake 
of  Lucerne;  and  as  Trigon  which  passes  through  Africa  Minor,  which 
carries  with  it  the  water  of  three  swamps  at  different  altitudes  one  after 
another:  of  which  the  highest  is  Munace,  the  middle  one  is  Pallas  and 
the  lowest  is  Triton.  Again,  the  Nile  has  its  source  in  three  very  high 
lakes  in  Ethiopia:  it  runs  to  the  north  and  discharges  itself  into  the 
Egyptian  sea  with  a  course  of  four  thousand  miles,  and  its  shortest 
and  most  direct  line  which  is  known  measures  three  thousand  miles; 
it  issues  forth  from  the  Mountains  of  the  Moon  from  divers  and 
unknown  beginnings;  and  comes  upon  the  said  lakes  high  above  the 
watery  sphere  at  an  altitude  of  about  four  thousand  braccia,  that  is 
a  mile  and  a  third,  in  order  to  allow  for  the  Nile  falling  a  braccio  in 
every  mile.  And  the  Rhone  issues  from  the  lake  of  Geneva  and  flows 
first  west  then  south  with  a  course  of  four  hundred  miles,  and  empties 
its  waters  in  the  Mediterranean  sea. 

The  centre  of  a  particular  sphere  of  water  is  that  which  occurs  in  the 
tiniest  particles  of  dew,  which  are  seen  in  perfect  roundness  clustering 
upon  the  leaves  of  the  plants  on  which  it  falls;  it  is  of  such  lightness 
that  it  does  not  flatten  itself  upon  the  spot  on  which  it  rests,  and  it 


768  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

is  almost  supported  by  the  atmosphere  that  surrounds  it,  so  that  it  does 
not  itself  exert  any  pressure  or  form  any  foundation;  and  for  this 
reason  its  surface  is  drawn  to  itself  equally  from  every  side  with  equal 
force;  and  so  each  part  runs  to  meet  another  with  equal  force,  and  they 
become  magnets  one  of  another,  with  the  result  that  of  necessity  each 
becomes  of  perfect  roundness,  forming  its  centre  therefore  in  the 
middle  at  an  equal  distance  from  each  point  of  its  surface,  and  being 
pulled  asunder  equally  by  each  part  of  its  gravity,  always  placing  itself 
in  the  middle  between  opposite  parts  of  equal  weight.  But  as  the 
weight  of  this  particle  of  water  comes  to  be  increased,  the  centre  of 
the  curved  surface  immediately  emerges  from  this  portion  of  water, 
and  makes  its  way  towards  the  centre  of  the  common  sphere  of  the 
water;  and  the  more  the  weight  of  this  drop  increases  the  nearer  the 
centre  of  the  said  curve  approaches  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth. 

Leic.  34  v. 

I  have  seen  in  the  case  of  two  small  canals  each  of  a  breadth  of  two 
braccia,  which  serve  as  a  line  of  demarcation  between  the  road  and  the 
estates,  how  their  waters  clashed  together  with  unequal  force,  and  then 
united,  and  bent  at  a  right  angle,  and  passed  underneath  a  small  bridge 
by  this  road  and  continued  their  course.  But  what  I  want  to  refer  to  in 
them  is  the  fact  that  they  formed  there  a  flow  and  ebb,  with  a  height  of 
a  quarter  of  a  braccio,  caused,  now  by  one,  now  by  the  other  canal,  as 
will  be  stated.  The  first  canal,  being  the  more  powerful,  subdued  the 
onrush  of  the  water  of  the  opposite  canal,  and  by  adding  to  it  from  the 
opposite  direction  caused  it  to  swell  up;  and  then  the  water  coming 
above  this  from  the  swollen  river,  rose  up  in  such  a  way  as  to  acquire 
so  much  weight  from  the  more  sluggish  water  that  it  overcame  the 
impetus  and  power  of  the  water  which  at  first  was  more  powerful,  and 
so  drove  it  back  with  great  fury;  and  consequently  the  victor,  re- 
doubling the  impetus  of  its  movement,  entered  with  an  undulation 
extending  over  more  than  a  hundred  feet  into  the  more  powerful 
canal,  which  at  that  time  retarded  and  held  up  such  of  its  waters  as 
were  at  the  boundary  of  the  conquering  wave.  And  from  this  wave 
upwards  the  river  massed  together  so  much  water  that  after  the  end 
of  the  aforesaid  impetus  of  the  wave,  these  waters  gained  the  victory 
and  drove  back  the  first  waters;  and  so  they  continued  in  succession, 


THE  NATURE  OF   WATER  769 

without  ever  retarding  the  movement  of  that  third  canal  in  which  they 
were  united  under  the  aforesaid  bridge. 

For  this  canal  had  four  different  movements,  of  which  the  first  and 
second  were  with  greater  or  less  current,  and  the  others  according  as  it 
varied  from  the  right  to  the  left  bank.  The  variation  from  the  greater 
to  the  less  current  occurred  when  one  of  the  streams  of  water  made 
itself  victor  over  the  other,  for  as  this  other  is  turned  back  together 
with  that  which  drives  it  an  abundance  of  water  is  created  under  the 
bridge.  The  fall  of  the  water  under  this  bridge  took  place  when  the 
one  stream  of  water  which  conquered  the  other  had  almost  consumed 
its  impetus  and  the  opposing  stream  was  left  with  its  force  already 
exhausted;  the  water  under  the  bridge  was  then  extremely  low.  The 
changing  across  of  the  current  from  the  right  to  the  left  bank  occurred 
when  the  water  on  the  right  or  the  left  was  victor,  that  is  when  the 
water  on  the  right  was  victor  the  current  struck  against  the  left  bank, 
and  when  the  current  in  the  canal  on  the  left  was  victor  it  struck  upon 
the  right  bank  underneath  the  aforesaid  bridge. 

And  if  this  ebb  and  flow  created  within  so  small  a  quantity  of  water 
has  a  variation  of  a  quarter  of  a  braccio,  what  will  it  be  in  the  great 
channels  of  the  seas  which  are  shut  in  between  the  islands  and  the 
mainland  ? 

It  will  be  so  much  the  more  in  proportion  as  its  waters  are  greater. 

Leic.  35  r. 

OF  THE  WAVES  OF  WATER 

The  wave  of  water  created  by  the  wind  is  slower  than  the  wind  that 
moves  it,  and  swifter  than  the  current  of  the  water  that  produces  the 
wind;  of  this  there  is  an  example  in  the  waves  of  the  meadows. 

The  wave  of  the  water  created  by  the  descent  of  the  rivers  is  slower 
than  the  current  of  the  water  that  produces  it;  and  this  happens  because 
the  wave  in  such  rivers  is  formed  from  the  bottom  of  this  river,  or 
from  its  sides,  and  it  stands  as  firm  as  is  the  firmness  of  the  object  that 
produces  it,  while  the  water,  which  continually  forms  itself  into  a  wave, 
is  continually  escaping  from  this  wave. 

There  are  many  occasions  when  the  wave  of  the  water  and  that  of 
the  wind  have  the  same  course;  and  many  occasions  when  they  are 
contrary,  intersecting  at  right  angles  or  often  at  acute  angles. 


770  THE  NATURE  OF  WATER 

The  movement  of  the  falling  wave  penetrates  into  the  movement  of 
the  wave  recoiling.  The  wave  of  the  water  in  a  circular  vessel  runs 
from  the  edge  to  the  centre  and  is  then  bent  back  from  the  centre 
to  the  edge  and  from  the  edge  to  the  centre;  and  so  it  continues  in 
succession. 

The  wave  of  a  triangular  vessel,  or  a  vessel  with  sides,  has  not  uni- 
formity of  time,  because  its  sides  and  angles  are  not  equidistant  from 
the  centre  of  the  vessel. 

The  circle  of  the  wave  made  by  an  object  in  running  water  will  be 
oval  in  shape.  Leic.  36  v.

OF  THE  FALL  OF  A  RIVER 

[With  sketch] 

If  you  should  wish  to  know  what  the  fall  of  a  river  is  in  each  mile 
without  employing  any  other  instrument  for  observing  levels,  you 
should  follow  this  method: — Be  careful  to  choose  a  part  of  the  river 
which  has  the  most  conformity  with  the  general  range  of  the  course 
of  which  you  wish  to  know  the  fall,  and  take  in  it  a  hundred  braccia 
of  bank  of  which  the  beginning  and  the  end  arc  marked  by  two  rods, 
as  is  shown  above  in  a  h,  and  at  the  beginning  c  launch  a  bladder, 
oak-apple,  or  small  piece  of  cork,  and  observe  how  many  beats  of 
time  the  aforesaid  object  travelling  with  the  descending  wave  takes  to 
arrive  at  the  end  of  the  journey  of  the  hundred  braccia,  and  then 
measure  many  other  courses,  some  slower  and  some  more  rapid,  and 
afterwards  measure  the  fall  of  the  hundred  braccia  with  the  instrument 


772  HYDRAULICS 

for  observing  levels.  And  by  this  process,  having  measured  different 
reaches  of  the  water,  you  will  then  know  how  to  speak  only  for  over 
a  hundred  paces  of  a  bank;  and  by  observing  how  many  beats  of  time 
your  oak-apple  has  taken  to  traverse  this  course  you  will  be  able  to 
calculate  the  fall  that  it  makes  per  mile.  Tr.  56  a

If  you  wish  to  make  water  rise  a  mile  and  to  cause  it  to  rest  upon  a 
mountain  do  as  is  represented  above.  And  if  you  wish  the  stream  of 
water  to  be  as  big  as  your  leg  make  the  conduit  as  big  as  your  thigh. 
And  if  it  is  to  rise  a  mile  make  it  also  descend  two  miles,  and  then  the 
violence  of  the  water  which  is  found  between  b  and  c  will  be  so  great 
that  it  will  draw  up  the  water  which  is  found  in  d  e  and  will  turn  the 
wheel  of  the  water  pump.  And  you  must  know  that  no  air  can  enter 
into  the  water  chamber  by  the  water  pump,  seeing  that  every  time  that 
the  screw  of  the  water  pump  turns  back,  the  valve  which  is  at  the 
bottom  of  the  reservoir  closes,  and  even  if  it  were  not  so  well  stopped 
up  it  could  not  admit  the  air  because  it  finds  itself  two  braccia  under 
water,  and  consequently  could  not  admit  air  unless  it  first  admit  the 
two  braccia  of  water.  When  you  wish  to  fill  the  conduit  you  must  first 
of  all  have  a  small  lake  filled  with  rains,  and  stop  up  with  clay  the 
pipes  at  the  base  of  it,  that  is  at  c  and  <?,  and  then  let  this  lake  discharge 
itself  into  the  conduit.  When  the  water  has  risen  half  a  braccio  up  the 
wheel  close  the  box  tightly  and  then  at  the  same  time  unstop  the 
conduit  at  its  base  in  c  and  make  the  wheel  four  braccia.        b  26  r.

OF  THE  INSTRUMENT  ABOVE 

Let  a  b  be  stagnant  water,  let  a  c  be  a  screw  which  is  turned  by  the 
distaff  z,  and  the  said  screw  carries  the  water  into  the  chamber  c  /,  and 
from  the  said  chamber  a  siphon  tube  proceeds  which  carries  the  water 
to  another  chamber  which  is  round  the  centre  of  the  wheel  of  the  first 
movement,  and  from  there  the  eight  spokes  take  the  water,  which  after 
it  has  fulfilled  its  function  falls  back  to  the  spot  from  whence  it  started.

a  the  instrument  above: 
m  keeps  c  unstopped  as  long  as  it  falls,  and  when  m  departs  c  closes, 
and  when  m  comes  to  the  bottom  s  goes  to  the  top  and  draws  after  it 
the  water  of  the  well.  Forster  1  41  v. 

[Drawings] 

The  water  after  issuing  from  the  pump  runs  by  the  line  a  c,  and 
pauses  at  s,  and  there  makes  counterpoise  and  falls  down  together 
with  the  lever  n  m,  and  draws  up  fresh  water,  of  which  part  goes  in 
counterpoise  and  part  remains  up  by  the  line  b  f. 

The  water  departs  from  the  centre  a  and  flows  in  b,  and  from  b  as 
far  as  c  it  makes  a  level  lever,  and  from  c  it  rises  by  the  wheel  of  the 
screw  gently  and  returns  to  the  centre  c;  and  make  it  with  sixteen 
spokes. 

Let  a  b  be  the  level  of  the  earth,  p  is  the  lever  of  m,  q  is  that  of  #, 
and  thus  first  one  then  the  other  after  the  manner  of  bellows  perform 
their  function. 

This  as  far  as  relates  to  the  cause  of  its  movement  has  similarity  with 
that  above,  and  it  varies  only  in  that  screw  in  the  centre  which  con- 
ducts the  water  upwards.  Forster  1  42  r. 

[Drawings] 

Here  the  water  having  ascended  by  the  screw  will  arrive  by  the 
pipe  s  at  the  point  a,  and  from  a  b  it  will  make  equidistant  lever,  and 
from  b  n  will  return  to  the  first  screw,  and  will  always  repeat  the  same 
process,  and  above  all  it  makes  it  wider  at  the  end  than  at  the  be- 
ginning. 


774  HYDRAULICS 

The  screw  a  gives  the  water  to  the  screw  b,  and  the  screw  b  gives 
movement  with  the  same  water  to  the  screw  a.  Forster  i  42  v. 

[With  drawings] 

The  water  that  falls  from  the  mouth  g  comes  from  the  chamber  / 
pressed  by  the  lead  d,  and  when  the  chamber  /  is  empty  the  water  will 
be  raised  into  the  chamber  a  by  a  valve  which  opens  inwards.  Conse- 
quently as  the  part  below  becomes  lighter  and  the  part  above  heavier 
it  suddenly  turns  right  over  and  the  lead  c  presses  the  chamber  a  and 
so  it  is  always  in  motion.  Forster  1  45  v. 

The  left  chamber  sends  its  water  from  /  in  b  and  in  this  b  there  is  a 
valve  opening  inwards,  by  means  of  which  the  chamber  c  b  a  comes  to 
be  filled,  and  the  air  escapes  by  a  n;  but  make  the  mouth  a  higher 
than  the  other  part  so  that  the  water  may  not  pour  out.  The  chamber 
d  will  be  full  of  air  and  the  part  e  will  be  lead.  When  the  chamber  a 
b  c  shall  be  full  it  will  turn  right  over  and  the  lead  will  remain  above 
and  will  press  the  water  on  the  left,  and  by  the  time  that  the  water 
has  made  its  exit  the  lead  will  have  gone  below  and  the  chamber  will 
receive  the  water  from  the  right  through  m  s.  Forster  1  46  r. 

[With  drawings] 
To  make  water  rise  and  remain  upon  the  ascent.  Forster   1  50  v. 

This  water  rises  by  way  of  a  pump,  and  after  issuing  forth  at  the 
extremity  of  this  pump  it  runs  by  the  lever  from  c  a  and  from  /  b,  and 
having  arrived  at  the  extremity  of  the  said  lever  the  water  that  follows 
creates  counterpoise.  Forster  1  51  r. 

The  water  rises  by  the  screw  a  b  and  falls  in  the  chamber  c,  and 
from  there  it  is  drawn  off  by  the  siphon  b  f  and  carried  into  the 
chamber  p,  and  from  there  until  counterpoise  is  made  in  s,  and  then 
it  falls  into  the  stagnant  water  below. 

This  wheel  with  the  lever  a  n  will  turn  and  draw  the  water  with 
the  circle.  But  see  that  when  the  buckets  are  ten  you  make  twelve  of 
the  lever  and  one  of  the  counterlever.  Forster  1  51  v.

Let  sluices  be  constructed  in  the  Val  di  Chiana  at  Arezzo,  so  that  in 
summer  when  there  is  a  shortage  of  water  in  the  Arno  the  canal  will 
not  become  dried  up,  and  let  this  canal  be  twenty  braccia  wide  at  the 
bottom  and  thirty  at  the  surface  and  the  general  level  two  braccia  or  four, 
because  two  of  these  braccia  serve  the  mills  and  the  meadows.  This  will 
fertilise  the  country,  and  Prato,  Pistoia  and  Pisa,  together  with  Florence 
will  have  a  yearly  revenue  of  more  than  two  hundred  thousand  ducats, 
and  they  will  supply  labour  and  money  for  this  useful  work,  and  the 
Lucchesi  likewise.  Since  the  Lago  di  Sesto  will  be  navigable  make  it 
pass  by  way  of  Prato  and  Pistoia  and  cut  through  at  Serravalle  and  go 
out  into  the  lake,  for  then  there  will  be  no  need  of  locks  or  supports, 
which  are  not  permanent  but  require  a  constant  supply  of  labour  to 
work  them  and  to  maintain  them.  c.a.  46  r.  b 

And  know  that  this  canal  cannot  be  dug  for  less  than  four  denari 
per  braccio,  paying  each  labourer  at  the  rate  of  four  soldi  per  day.  And 
the  time  of  construction  of  the  canal  should  be  between  the  middle  of 
March  and  the  middle  of  June,  because  the  peasants  are  not  then 
occupied  with  their  ordinary  work,  and  the  days  are  long  and  the  heat

If  the  river  c  d  b  sends  out  a  branch  at  the  point  a  and  it  falls  back 
again  at  the  point  b,  the  line  a  b  will  have  so  much  greater  pressure

If  a  canal  of  water  passes  beneath  another  river  with  a  bend  like  that

OF  A  GOVERNOR  OF  RIVERS 

In  order  to  enable  each  large  river  to  maintain  itself  within  its  banks, 
it  is  necessary  for  an  official  to  be  appointed  with  authority  to  com- 
mand the  people  who  live  near  to  it,  and  so  to  effect  repairs  whenever 
it  has  burst  its  banks. 


OF  THE  MAINTAINING  OF  RIVERS 

The  river  which  has  the  straightest  course  will  best  keep  within  its 
banks.  c.a.  297  r.  b 

A  trabocco  is  four  braccia,  and  a  mile  is  three  thousand  of  these 
braccia,  and  the  braccio1  is  divided  into  twelve  inches  .  .  .  and  the  water 
of  the  canals  has  a  fall  of  two  inches  in  every  hundred  trabocchi. 
Therefore  fourteen  inches  of  fall  are  necessary  in  two  thousand  eight 
hundred  braccia  of  movement  of  the  said  canals.  It  follows  that  fifteen 
inches  of  fall  give  the  necessary  momentum  to  the  current  of  the  water 
of  the  said  canals,  that  is  one  and  a  half  braccio  to  the  mile;  and  by  this 
we  may  conclude  that  the  water  which  is  taken  from  the  river  of  Ville-

Make  this  in  the  book  of  the  aids,  and  in  order  to  prove  ic  cite  the 
propositions  that  have  been  proved.  And  this  is  the  true  order,  because 
if  you  wished  to  supply  a  help  to  each  proposition  it  would  still  be 
necessary  for  you  to  make  new  instruments  in  order  to  prove  this 
utility;  and  by  so  doing  you  would  confuse  the  order  of  the  forty  books 
and  so  also  the  order  of  the  figures;  thus  you  would  have  to  blend

A  great  weight  may  be  deposited  upon  a  ship  without  the  use  of 
windlasses,  levers,  ropes,  or  any  force: 

In  order  to  deposit  each  very  heavy  weight  that  is  all  in  one  piece 
upon  a  floating  barge,  it  is  necessary  to  draw  this  weight  to  the  shore  of 
the  sea,  setting  it  lengthwise  to  the  sea  at  the  edge  of  the  shore.  Then  a 
canal  should  be  made  to  pass  beneath  this  weight  and  to  project  as  far 
beyond  it  as  the  half  of  the  length  of  the  barge  which  is  to  carry 
this  weight;  and  in  like  manner  the  width  of  this  canal  should  be 
regulated  by  the  width  of  the  barge,  which  should  be  filled  with  water 
and  drawn  beneath  the  weight.  And  then  after  the  water  has  been 
baled  out  the  ship  will  rise  to  such  a  height  as  to  raise  the  said  weight 
from  the  ground  of  itself.  Thus  laden  you  will  then  be  able  to  draw  it

OF  THE  CANAL  OF  MARTESANA 

By  the  making  of  the  Martesana  canal  the  amount  of  water  in  the 
Adda  is  lessened  owing  to  it  being  distributed  over  many  districts  in 
order  to  supply  the  meadows.  A  remedy  for  this  would  be  to  make 
many  small  channels  because  the  water  which  has  been  drunk  up  by 
the  earth  does  no  service  to  anyone,  nor  any  injury  because  it  has  been 
taken  from  no  one;  and  by  the  construction  of  such  channels  the  water 
which  before  was  lost  returns  again  and  is  once  more  of  service  and 
use  to  mankind.  And  unless  such  channels  have  first  been  constructed 
it  is  not  possible  to  make  these  runlets  in  the  lower-lying  country.  We 
should  say  therefore  that  if  such  channels  are  made  in  the  Martesana, 


CANALIZATION  779 

the  same  water,  drunk  in  by  the  soil  of  the  meadows,  will  be  sent  back 
upon  the  other  meadows  by  means  of  runlets,  this  being  water  which 
had  previously  disappeared;  and  if  there  were  a  scarcity  of  water  at 
Ghiara  d'Adda  and  in  the  Mucca  and  the  inhabitants  were  able  to 
make  these  channels  it  would  be  seen  that  the  same  water  drunk  in  by 
the  meadows  serves  several  times  for  this  purpose.  f  76  v.

The  canal  which  is  sixteen  braccia  in  width  at  the  bottom  and  twenty

and  if  it  is  four  braccia  in  depth  and  costs  four  denari  per  square  braccio 
it  will  cost  per  mile  for  excavation  alone  nine  hundred  ducats,  the 
square  braccio  being  calculated  in  ordinary  braccia.

land,  then  these  three  thousand  braccia  lose  a  quarter  so  that  there 
remain  two  thousand  two  hundred  and  fifty  braccia;  and  therefore  at 
four  denari  the  braccio  the  mile  comes  out  at  six  hundred  and  seventy 
five  ducats;  at  three  denari  per  square  braccio  the  mile  works  out  at  five 
hundred  and  six  and  a  quarter  ducats,  and  therefore  the  excavation  of

into  the  Ticino. 

And  in  order  thus  to  raise  the  openings  make  the  course  of  the 
water  more  [less?]  slanting,  and  make  the  course  slower  in  conse- 
quence. Then  this  course  in  the  same  time  draws  a  less  quantity  of 
water  in  the  canal,  and  the  mills  receive  less  than  at  first  although  they 
receive  the  whole  of  it,  and  the  outlets  become  full  of  impurities  and 
choked  up. 

However  I  shall  maintain  the  water  in  the  canal  at  a  height  of  one

that  it  irrigated  and  make  the  country  fertile,  so  that  it  would  supply 
food  for  the  inhabitants  and  it  would  also  serve  as  a  navigable  canal  for 
purposes  of  commerce. 

HOW  THE  RIVER  IN  ITS  COURSE  SCOURS  THE  BED 
OF  THE  STREAM 

By  the  ninth  of  the  third :  that  which  is  swifter  consumes  its  own  bed 
more,  and  conversely  the  water  that  is  slower  leaves  more  behind  of 
that  which  causes  it  to  be  turbid. 

Therefore  when  the  rivers  are  in  spate  you  ought  to  open  the  flood- 
gates of  the  mills  so  that  the  whole  course  of  the  river  may  .  .  .  there 
should  be  many  floodgates  for  each  mill  so  that  .  .  .  may  open  and 
give  a  greater  impetus  and  thus  the  whole  bed  will  be  scoured. 

And  let  the  sluice  be  made  movable  like  the  one  that  I  devised  in 
Friuli,  where  when  the  floodgate  was  open  the  water  which  issued  forth 
from  it  hollowed  out  the  bottom;  and  below  the  two  sites  of  the  mills 
there  should  be  one  of  these  floodgates,  one  with  movable  sluices  being 
placed  below  each  of  the  mills.  b.m.  270  v. 

Here  there  are,  my  lord,  many  gentlemen  who  will  undertake  this 
expense  between  them,  if  so  be  that  they  are  allowed  to  enjoy  the  use  of 
the  waters,  the  mills  and  the  passage  of  ships;  and  when  the  price  shall 
have  been  repaid  them  they  will  give  back  the  canal  of  the  Martesana. 

Forster  in  15  r. 

That  a  river  which  has  to  be  diverted  from  one  place  to  another 
ought  to  be  coaxed  and  not  coerced  with  violence;  and  in  order  to  do 
this  it  is  necessary  to  build  a  sort  of  dam  projecting  into  the  river  and 
then  to  throw  another  one  below  it  projecting  farther;  and  by  proceed- 


CANALIZATION  783 

ing  in  this  way  with  a  third,  a  fourth,  and  a  fifth,  the  river  will  dis- 
charge itself  in  the  channel  allotted  to  it,  or  by  this  means  it  may  be 
turned  away  from  the  place  where  it  has  caused  damage,  as  happened 
in  Flanders  according  to  what  I  was  told  by  Niccolo  di  Forzore. 
[With  drawing]  How  one  ought  to  repair  by  means  of  a  screen  a  bank 
struck  by  the  water,  as  below  the  island  of  Cocomeri.         Leic.  13  r. 

FROM  'THE  ORDER  OF  THE  BOOK  OF  WATER' 

No  canal  which  issues  forth  from  rivers  will  be  permanent  unless  the 
water  of  the  river  from  which  it  has  its  origin  is  entirely  closed  up,  as  is 
the  case  with  the  canal  of  Martesana  and  that  which  issues  from  the 
Ticino. 

The  canals  ought  always  to  be  provided  with  sluices,  so  that  excessive 
floods  may  not  damage  or  destroy  the  bank  and  the  water  may  always 
maintain  itself  in  the  same  volume.  Leic.  18  r. 

How  in  order  to  twist  the  line  of  the  water  one  should  make  a  twist 
in  the  line  of  the  bank  with  a  few  stones :  By  the  fourth  of  the  second, 
where  it  was  proved  that  the  line  of  the  water  of  the  rivers  was  a  con- 
course of  the  reflex  movements  of  the  water  that  has  struck  upon  its 
banks,  and  has  there  multiplied  and  raised  itself  and  hollowed  out  its 
bed  beneath  itself.  And  this  is  what  would  occur  if  anyone  set  out  to 
twist  the  bank  when  the  river  a  certain  space  above  had  shown  that  it 
wished  to  bend,  and  then  had  not  continued  this  bending  process,  and 
you  were  to  follow  it  up  again  gradually  and  minister  to  its  first  desire 
with  an  almost  imperceptible  curve;  and  thus  you  will  proceed  to  make 
your  attempt.  But  if  you  should  try  to  bend  the  water  in  the  direct  line 
of  its  strength  all  your  work  will  be  in  vain,  because  it  will  break  every 
obstacle.  And  if  with  your  lock  you  raise  the  level  of  the  water  so  high 
that  it  swallows  up  so  much  in  itself  that  the  current  loses  its  impetus 
in  the  expanse  of  water  that  has  been  formed,  this  can  have  a  good 
result,  and,  by  the  fifth  of  the  first,  it  will  fill  up  all  its  bed  with  mud, 
But  make  it  so  that  the  water  does  not  run  along  the  bank.

[Of  diverting  a  river  and  protecting  a  house] 

I  have  a  house  upon  the  bank  of  the  river,  and  the  water  is  carrying 
oflF  the  soil  beneath  it  and  is  about  to  make  it  fall  in  ruin;  consequently 


784  CANALIZATION 

I  wish  to  act  in  such  a  way  that  the  river  may  fill  me  up  again  the 
cavity  it  has  already  made,  and  strengthen  the  said  house  for  me.  In  a 
case  such  as  this  we  are  governed  by  the  fourth  of  the  second,  which 
proves  that  'the  impetus  of  every  movabe  thing  pursues  its  course  by 
the  line  along  which  it  was  created';  for  which  reason  we  shall  make  a 
barrier  at  the  slant  n  m,  but  it  would  be  better  to  take  it  higher  up  at 
o  p,  so  that  all  the  material  from  your  side  of  the  hump  might  be 
deposited  in  the  hollow  where  your  house  is;  and  the  material  from  the 
hump  ^  would  then  do  the  same,  so  that  it  would  serve  the  need  in  the 
same  winter.  But  if  the  river  were  great  and  powerful  the  said  barrier 
would  have  to  be  made  in  three  or  four  attempts,  the  first  of  which, 
made  in  the  direction  that  the  water  is  approaching,  ought  to  project 
beyond  its  bank  a  fourth  part  of  the  width  of  the  river;  then,  below  this, 
you  should  make  another,  distant  as  far  as  the  summit  of  the  leap  that 
the  water  makes  when  it  falls  from  the  first  barrier, — for  in  this  summit 
of  its  leap  the  water  leaves  the  summit  of  the  mound  made  by  the 
shingle  which  was  hollowed  out  by  the  first  percussion,  made  by  the 
water  when  it  fell  from  the  first  barrier  upon  its  bed.  And  this  second 
dam  extends  halfway  across  the  breadth  of  the  river.  The  third  should 
follow  below  this,  starting  from  the  same  bank,  and  at  the  same  fixed 
distance  from  the  second  as  the  second  was  from  the  first;  and  it  follows 
its  length  as  far  as  three-quarters  of  the  width  of  the  river.  And  so  you 
will  proceed  with  the  fourth  dam  which  will  close  the  whole  river 
across.  And  from  these  four  dams  or  barriers  there  will  result  much 
greater  power  than  if  all  this  material  had  been  formed  into  one  barrier, 
which  in  uniform  thickness  would  have  closed  the  whole  width  of  the 
stream.  And  this  happens  by  the  fifth  of  the  second,  where  it  is  proved 
that  the  material  of  one  single  support,  if  it  be  quadrupled  in  length, 
will  not  support  the  fourth  of  that  which  it  used  formerly  to  support, 
but  much  less. 
[Drawing] 

I  find  that  the  water,  that  falls  at  the  foot  of  the  dams  of  rivers, 
places  material  towards  the  approach  of  the  water,  and  carries  away 
from  the  foot  of  the  dam  all  the  material  on  which  it  strikes  as  it  falls. 
Now  I  could  wish  that  it  would  place  the  material  where  it  falls,  and 
thereby  bank  up  and  fortify  this  dam:  which  thing  might  be  done  in 
this  way —  Leic.  32  r.

AN   EXPERIMENT  WITH   THE   SENSE  OF  TOUCH 

If  you  place  your  second  finger  under  the  tip  of  the  third  in  such  a 
way  that  the  whole  of  the  nail  is  visible  on  the  far  side,  then  anything

the  object  touched  is  round.  c.a.  204  v.  a 

I  take  a  vessel  filled  with  wine  and  I  draw  of?  the  half  and  fill  it  up

Then  I  draw  ofl  half  again  and  then  fill  up  with  water,  wherefore

[Sphericity  of  water.  Experiment] 

A  drop  of  dew  with  its  perfect  round  affords  us  an  opportunity  of 
considering  some  of  the  varied  functions  of  the  watery  sphere;  how  it 
contains  within  itself  the  body  of  the  earth  without  the  destruction  of 
the  sphericity  of  its  surface.  For  if  first  you  take  a  cube  of  lead  of  the 
size  of  a  grain  of  millet,  and  by  means  of  a  very  fine  thread  attached 
to  it  you  submerge  it  in  this  drop,  you  will  perceive  that  the  drop  will 
not  lose  any  of  its  first  roundness,  although  it  has  been  increased  by  an 
amount  equal  to  the  size  of  the  cube  which  has  been  shut  within  it. 

f  62  v. 
[Light  and  heat.  Sun  and  mirrors] 

Whether  the  greater  light  with  less  heat  causes  concave  mirrors  to 
reflect  rays  of  more  powerful  heat  than  a  body  of  greater  heat  and  less 
light. 

For  such  an  experiment  a  lump  of  copper  should  be  heated  and 
placed  so  that  it  may  be  seen  through  a  round  hole,  which  in  size  and 
distance  from  the  mirror  is  equal  to  the  heated  copper. 

You  will  thus  have  two  bodies  equal  in  distance  but  differing  in 
heat  and  differing  in  radiance,  and  you  will  find  that  the  greater  heat 
will  produce  a  reflection  of  greater  heat  in  the  mirror  than  the  afore- 
said flame. 

We  may  say  therefore  that  it  is  not  the  brightness  of  the  sun  which 
warms  but  its  natural  heat. 

It  is  proved  that  the  sun  in  its  nature  is  warm  and  not  cold  as  has 
already  been  stated. 

The  concave  mirror  although  cold  when  it  receives  the  rays  of  the 
fire  reflects  them  hotter  than  the  fire. 

A  ball  of  glass  when  filled  with  cold  water  sends  out  from  itself  rays 
caught  from  the  fire  which  are  even  hotter  than  the  fire. 

From  the  two  experiments  referred  to,  it  follows,  as  regards  this 
warmth  of  the  rays  that  issue  from  the  mirror  or  from  the  ball  of 


EXPERIMENTS  787 

cold  water,  that  they  are  warm  of  their  own  essence,  and  not  because 
the  mirror  or  ball  are  hot.  And  in  this  case  the  same  thing  happens 
when  the  sun  has  passed  through  the  bodies  which  it  warms  by  its 
own  essence.  And  from  this  it  has  been  concluded  that  the  sun  is  not 
hot,  whilst  by  the  experiments  referred  to  it  has  been  proved  that  it 
is  extremely  hot, — from  the  experiment  which  has  been  mentioned,  of 
the  mirror  and  of  the  ball  which  being  cold  and  taking  the  rays  of  the 
heat  of  the  fire  convert  them  into  warm  rays  because  the  primary  cause 
is  warm.  And  the  same  thing  happens  with  the  sun,  which  being  itself 
warm,  in  passing  through  these  cold  mirrors  reflects  great  heat.

HOW  TO  MEASURE  THE  THINNESS  OF  WATER.  EXPERIMENT 

You  will  discover  the  various  degrees  of  thinness  of  the  waters  by 
suspending  at  a  uniform  depth  of  the  opposite  ends  a  strip  of  old 
linen  cloth,  which  should  be  dry,  and  which  should  penetrate  on  each 
side  as  far  as  the  bottom  of  two  vases  filled  with  the  two  different 
kinds  of  water  with  which  you  wish  to  make  your  experiment.  Then 
these  waters  will  rise  a  certain  distance  on  the  cloth  and  will  proceed 
gradually  to  evaporate,  and  as  much  as  has  been  the  evaporation  of 
that  which  has  risen  up,  so  much  will  it  rise  again  from  the  rest  until 
the  vase  is  dried  up.  And  if  you  refill  the  vase  the  water  will  all  rise 
in  the  piece  of  cloth  with  imperceptible  slowness,  and  so  as  has  been 
said  it  will  gradually  become  dried  up.  And  by  this  means  the  piece 
will  remain  full  of  the  rest  of  the  water  which  has  evaporated,  and 
in  this  way,  by  means  of  the  weights  that  have  been  acquired,  you 
will  be  able  to  tell  which  water  holds  more  earth  in  solution  than  the 
other.  g  37  v. 

•     OF  THE  SIPHON  WITH  MERCURY  FOR  MAKING  FIRE 

Since  the  more  the  water  in  the  vessel  diminishes  the  more  its  sur- 
face is  lowered,  and  the  more  the  surface  of  the  water  is  lowered  the 
less  swiftly  the  siphon  flows,  but  if  the  siphon  descends  at  the  same 
time  as  the  surface  of  the  water  that  supports  it,  without  doubt  the 
movement  of  the  water  which  pours  through  will  always  be  equal  in 
itself,  therefore  in  order  to  make  this  equality  let  us  make  the  vessel 


788  EXPERIMENTS 

n  in  position  above  the  bath  of  mercury  m.  This  vessel  n  is  a  boat 
which  supports  the  siphon  which  penetrates  below  from  the  air  into 
the  mercury.  And  this  mercury  proceeds  to  rise  through  the  siphon 
n  s  t  into  the  vessel  /.  And  in  proportion  as  the  surface  of  this  mer- 
cury descends  so  the  boat  which  rests  upon  it  descends  at  the  same 
time  as  the  siphon,  which  is  formed  of  fine  burnished  copper  and 
falls  into  a  vessel,  and  this  when  it  acquires  the  requisite  weight  falls 
and  thereby  creates  fire  by  its  impact.  g  48  r.

[The  flowing  oj  liquids] 

If  a  cask  is  filled  four  braccia  high  with  wine  and  throws  the  wine 
a  distance  of  four  braccia  away,  when  the  wine  has  become  so  lowered 
that  it  has  dropped  to  a  height  of  two  braccia  in  the  cask,  will  it  also 
throw  the  wine  through  the  same  pipe  a  distance  of  two  braccia,  that 
is  whether  the  fall,  and  the  range  that  the  pipe  can  throw,  diminish 
in  equal  proportion  or  no. 

If  from  the  cask  when  full  two  jugs  are  filled  through  the  pipe  in 
an  hour,  when  the  cask  is  half  full  it  ought  for  this  reason  to  fill  only 
one  jug  in  an  hour,  if  pouring  from  the  same  pipe. 

This  rule  with  all  the  other  similar  ones  about  waters  which  are 
poured  through  pipes  ought  to  be  put  at  the  commencement  of  the

cision a  counterpoise  to  the  opposite  arm.  The  thing  is  never  possible,

blow  or  cause  to  boil  and  reduce  to  steam  ten  pounds  of  brandy. 

But  see  that  the  room  is  closed  altogether,  and  throw  powder  of 
varnish  among  the  fumes  and  this  powder  will  be  found  floating  upon

These  scissors  open  and  shut  with  a  single  movement  of  the  hand. 

Scissors  used  by  the  bonnet-makers  for  cutting  cloth.  Rapid  in  the 
action  of  opening  and  shutting  like  the  others. 

This  [tool  I  has  in  itself  so  much  more  ease  in  its  movement  because 
the  user  does  not  have  to  adjust  the  spring  or  curve,  as  is  the  case  with 
those  scissors  which  are  all  in  one  piece.  With  these  it  is  not  necessary 
to  wait  in  order  to  cut  the  threads  of  the  cloth,  or  to  bend  by  force  the 
spring  which  is  in  the  heel  of  the  scissors. 

This  closes  at  the  same  rate  of  speed  as  the  rest;  but  opens  much 
more  rapidly.  c.a.  397  v.  a

BELLOWS  WITHOUT  LEATHER  AND  MERELY  OF  WOOD 

These  bellows  are  like  a  sugar  loaf  and  have  a  partition  which 
divides  them  lengthwise  in  two  parts.  One — that  is  the  upper  part — is 
filled  with  water;  that  below  is  filled  with  air.  The  water  falls  down 
into  the  cubic  space  of  the  air  through  a  small  hole  which  is  near  the 
socket,  and  the  increase  of  the  water  drives  the  air  through  the  mouth 
of  the  bellows.  Any  scarcity  of  water  in  the  upper  part  is  filled  by 
means  of  a  valve  which  admits  the  air,  and  so  also  with  the  others; 
and  this  is  the  most  serviceable  type  of  bellows  that  can  be  used.

[  Water  bellows]  [Drawings] 

These  are  kinds  of  bellows  without  leather  and  they  are  of  admir- 
able utility  and  extremely  durable.  And  their  method  of  use  is  as 
follows: — The  bellows  is  always  from  the  centre  downwards  full  of 
water,  that  is  M  N,  and  in  the  continual  revolution  of  the  bellows  N 
rises  until  it  reaches  the  air  hole  S  T  which  is  made  in  the  outside  of 
the  second  covering,  as  appears  in  the  instrument  below,  and  comes  to 
meet  with  the  said  pipe  S  T  the  hole  o  which  is  in  the  reservoir  N, 
and  as  much  as  is  the  volume  of  water  that  goes  from  N  to  M  so 
much  air  enters  through  the  hole  o  in  the  reservoir  N,  and  as  much 
air  is  driven  out  of  the  reservoir  M  as  N  gives  it  of  water.  And  the 
air  which  is  driven  out  from  M  by  the  water  is  that  which  blows  the 
bellows.  The  said  bellows  should  be  of  oak  because  this  resists  water 
for  the  longest  time,  and  have  inside  it  a  coating  of  turpentine  and 
pitch,  so  that  when  it  is  not  in  use  the  part  above  which  is  out  of  the 
water  does  not  come  to  open;  and  this  type  of  bellows  is  turned  by  the 
weight  of  a  man  walking  above  on  the  steps. 

It  would  also  be  extremely  useful  to  cause  it  to  turn  by  the  force  of 
a  fall  of  water. 

The  base  of  the  bellows  below  the  tube  S  T  remains  fixed,  and  the 
rest  turns  there  within  as  a  case  would  within  its  cover. 

Use  salt  water  so  that  it  may  not  become  foul  in  the  bellows.

MACHINE  FOR  EXCAVATING  EARTH 

[Drawing] 

Here  the  calculation  of  the  power  is  not  at  present  fixed. 

But  you,  reader,  have  to  understand  that  this  has  a  use,  which  arises 
by  means  of  the  saving  of  time,  which  saving  springs  from  the  fact 


INVENTIONS  795 

that  the  instrument  which  conveys  the  earth  up  from  below  is  always 
in  the  act  of  carrying  it  and  never  turns  back.  The  adversary  says  that 
in  this  case  it  takes  as  long  to  turn  round  in  a  useless  circle  as  to  turn 
hack  at  the  end  of  the  forward  action.  But  since  the  additional  spaces 
of  time  that  are  interposed  between  the  spaces  of  useful  time  are  equal 
in  this  and  in  all  other  inventions,  it  is  necessary  to  search  here  for  a 
method  whereby  the  time  may  be  spent  in  as  vigorous  and  effective 
a  method  of  work  as  possible,  which  will  be  by  inventing  a  machine 
that  will  take  more  earth;  as  wall  be  shown  on  the  reverse  of  this  page. 

The  winch  n  as  it  turns  causes  a  small  wheel  to  revolve,  and  this 
small  wheel  turns  the  cogged  wheel  /,  and  this  wheel  /  is  joined  to 
the  angle  of  the  boxes  which  carry  the  earth  from  the  swamp  and 
discharge  themselves  upon  the  barges.  But  the  two  cords  m  f  and  m  b 
revolve  round  the  pole  /,  and  make  the  instrument  move  with  the  two 
barges  against  m,  and  these  cords  are  very  useful  for  this  purpose. 

The  pole  is  so  made  as  to  descend  to  as  great  a  depth  as  the  wheel 
has  to  descend  in  order  to  deepen  the  water  of  the  marsh,      e  75  v. 

As  the  attachment  of  the  heavy  body  is  further  from  the  centre  of 
the  wheel  the  revolving  movement  of  the  wheel  round  its  pivot  will 
become  more  difficult  although  the  motive  power  may  not  vary. 

The  same  is  seen  with  the  time  of  clocks,  for,  if  you  place  the  two 
weights  nearer  or  farther  away  from  the  centre  of  the  timepiece,  you 
make  the  hours  shorter  or  longer.  f  7  v. 

[Magnifying  glasses] 

Lens  of  crystal  thickness,  at  the  sides  the  twelfth  part  of  an  inch. 
This  lens  of  crystal  should  be  free  from  spots  and  very  clear;  and  at 
the  sides  it  ought  to  be  the  thickness  of  a  twelfth  of  an  inch,  that  is 
to  say  of  the  one  hundred  and  forty-fourth  part  of  a  braccio,  and  thin 
in  the  centre  according  to  the  sight  that  it  ought  to  serve  for,  that  is 
to  say  according  to  the  proportion  of  those  lenses  which  agree  with  it; 
and  let  it  be  worked  in  the  same  mould  as  these  lenses.  The  width  of 
the  frame  will  be  one  sixth  of  a  braccio  and  its  length  one  quarter  of 
a  braccio;  consequently  it  will  be  three  inches  long  and  two  wide,  that 
is  to  say  a  square  and  a  half.  And  this  lens  should  be  held  at  a  distance 
of  a  third  of  a  braccio  from  the  eye  when  used,  and  it  should  be  the

same  distance  from  the  letter  that  you  are  reading.  If  it  is  farther 
away  this  letter  will  appear  larger,  so  that  the  ordinary  type  of  print 
will  seem  like  a  letter  on  an  apothecary's  chest. 

This  lens  is  suitable  for  keeping  in  a  cabinet;  but  if  you  wish  to  keep 
it  outside  make  it  one  eighth  of  a  braccio  long  and  one  twelfth  wide.

In  order  to  know  how  far  one  goes  in  an  hour  take  the  potter's  wheel

the  diameter  being  one  and  yf  braccia.  Then  tightly  close  the  instru- 
ment, have  harmonic  time,  smear  all  the  inside  of  the  instrument  with 
turpentine,  turn  the  wheel  uniformly  and  notice  where  the  top  layer 
of  dust  has  stuck  to  the  turpentine,  and  see  how  many  revolutions 
the  wheel  has  made  and  in  how  many  beats  of  harmonic  time.  And 
if  the  wheel  has  made  two  revolutions  in  one  beat  of  time,  which 
amounts  to  ten  braccia,  that  is  to  say  the  three-hundreth  part  of  a  mile, 
you  will  be  able  to  say  that  this  instrument  has  moved  a  mile  in  three 
hundred  beats  of  time,  and  that  an  hour  is  one  thousand  and  eighty 
beats  of  time;  which  will  make  three  miles  an  hour  and  one  hundred 
and  eighty  three-hundredth  parts.  f  48  v.

and  with  sardonyx  outside  and  then  transparent;  and  let  all  the  thick 
portion  of  the  pipes  be  made  up  of  these  mixtures,  and  then  moisten 
them  and  press  them  and  leave  them  to  dry  in  the  press;  if  you  press 
them  flat  they  will  give  one  effect,  if  you  press  them  into  a  rectangle 
they  will  give  another  and  similarly  if  you  press  them  into  a  triangle; 
but  if  you  press  them  in  front  or  folded  in  different  ways  you  will  also 
do  well. 

And  if  in  the  transparent  part  exposed  to  the  sun  you  make  with  a 
small  style  a  mixture  of  different  colours,  especially  of  black  and 
white  opaque,  and  yellow  of  burnt  orpiment,  you  can  make  very  beau-

LAMP 

[Drawing] 

Lamp  in  which  as  the  oil  becomes  low  the  wick  rises. 

And  this  proceeds  from  the  fact  that  the  wheel  which  raises  the 
wick  rests  upon  the  oil.  As  the  oil  diminishes  so  the  wheel  descends, 
and  as  it  descends  it  revolves  by  means  of  the  thread  that  is  wrapped 
round  its  axle,  and  the  cogs  of  the  wheel  push  the  toothed  pipe  that 
receives  the  wick. 

It  will  also  do  the  same  if  a  the  axle  of  the  wheel  does  not  descend, 
and  the  only  descent  is  that  of  the  light  object  b  which  floats  upon  the 
oil,  for  this  light  object  descends  at  the  same  time  as  the  surface  of 
the  oil,  and  causes  the  wheel  to  turn,  and  this  by  means  of  its  cogs 
pushes  up  the  aforesaid  cogged  pipe  with  a  slow  movement.

[With  drawings] 

This  can  also  be  made  without  a  spring,  but  the  screw  above  must 
always  be  joined  to  the  part  of  the  movable  sheath. 

No  coins  can  be  considered  as  good  which  have  not  the  rim  perfect; 
and  in  order  to  ensure  the  rim  being  perfect  it  is  necessary  first  that 
the  coins  should  be  absolutely  round. 

In  order  to  make  this  it  is  necessary  first  to  make  the  coin  perfect 
in  weight,  breadth  and  thickness;  therefore  you  must  first  have  many 
plates  made  of  this  [uniform]  breadth  and  thickness  drawn  through 
the  same  press,  and  these  should  remain  in  the  form  of  strips,  and 
from  these  strips  you  should  stamp  out  the  round  coins  after  the  man- 
ner in  which  sieves  are  made  for  chestnuts,  and  these  coins  are  then 
stamped  in  the  way  described  above. 

The  hollow  of  the  mould  should  be  uniformly  and  imperceptibly 
higher  at  the  top  than  at  the  bottom. 

This  cuts  the  coins  of  perfect  roundness,  thickness  and  weight,  and 
saves  the  man  who  cuts  and  weighs,  and  saves  also  the  man  who 
makes  the  coins  round. 

They  pass  therefore  merely  through  the  hands  of  the  worker  of  the 
plate  and  the  stamper,  and  they  are  very  fine  coins.  c  43  r.

OF  PERCUSSION 

Among  the  accidental  forces  of  nature,  percussion  greatly  exceeds 
each  of  the  others  created  by  the  motive  powers  of  heavy  bodies  in 
equal  time  with  equal  movement,  weight  and  force.  This  percussion 
is  divided  into  simple  and  compound.  Simple  is  that  in  which  the 
motive  power  which  is  the  striker  is  joined  with  the  movable  thing 
at  its  junction  at  the  place  struck;  compound  is  that  in  which  the 
movable  thing  as  it  strikes  does  not  end  its  movement  at  the  place  of 
its  impact,  as  does  the  hammer  which  strikes  the  die  that  stamps  the 
coins.  And  this  compound  percussion  is  much  weaker  than  simple 
percussion,  for  if  the  flat  end  of  the  head1  of  the  hammer  were  to 
attach  itself  to  the  coin  which  it  had  to  stamp  and  which  it  had  struck 
upon  the  mould  where  was  the  impression,  so  that  on  this  flat  end 
of  the  head  of  the  hammer  there  had  been  engraved  the  relief  that 
was  on  the  coin  in  reverse,  the  impression  would  be  more  definite  and 
clear  on  the  side  struck  with  simple  movement  than  on  the  side  where 
the  percussion  is  compound;  as  with  the  coin  that  remains  struck  in 
the  die  where  the  hammer  has  struck  it  in  its  descent,  the  percussion 
being  reflected  and  thrown  back  against  the  front  of  the  hammer.

SIPHON  CLOCK.  SLOW  TIME-FUSE

A  preparation  of  mercury  drawn  through  very  fine  copper  of  the 
shape  of  a  siphon,  the  sides  through  the  length  of  which  the  liquid 
rises  and  falls  being  of  imperceptible  thickness,  will  be  seen  to  form 
a  time-piece  after  the  manner  of  an  hourglass,  and  this  is  the  slowest 
and  most  graduated  descent  that  can  be  made,  so  much  so  that  it  may 
happen  that  in  an  hour  not  one  grain  of  the  mercury  passes  from  one 
vessel  to  the  other. 

And  the  surface  of  its  container  is  sensitive  by  reason  of  the  opacity 
of  the  mercury,  the  skin  of  this  mercury  becoming  imperceptibly  low- 
ered with  the  descent  that  occurs  as  the  siphon  discharges  itself;  and 
by  this  means  you  will  be  able  to  create  a  fire  which  by  means  of  per-

TO  KNOW  HOW  FAR  A  SHIP  TRAVELS  IN  AN  HOUR 

The  ancients  have  employed  different  methods  in  order  to  discover 
what  distance  a  ship  traverses  in  each  hour.  Among  them  is  Vitruvius 
who  expounds  one  in  his  work  on  architecture,  but  his  method  is  falla- 
cious like  the  others.  It  consists  of  a  wheel  from  a  mill  touching  the 
ocean  waves  at  its  extremities,  and  by  means  of  its  complete  revolutions 
describing  a  straight  line  which  represents  the  line  of  the  circumference 
of  this  wheel  reduced  to  a  condition  of  straightness.  But  this  device  is 
only  of  value  on  the  smooth  still  surface  of  lakes;  should  the  water 
move  at  the  same  time  as  the  ship  with  an  equal  movement  the  wheel 
remains  motionless;  and  if  the  movement  of  the  water  be  either  more 
or  less  swift  than  that  of  the  ship,  then  the  wheel  will  not  have  a  move- 
ment equal  to  that  of  the  ship,  so  that  such  an  invention  has  but  little 
value. 

Another  method  may  be  tested  by  experiment  over  a  known  distance 
from  one  island  to  another,  and  this  is  by  the  use  of  a  light  board  which 
is  struck  by  the  wind,  and  which  comes  to  slant  to  a  greater  or  less 
degree  as  the  wind  that  strikes  it  is  swifter  or  less  swift,  and  this  is  in 
Battista  Alberti. 

As  regards  the  method  of  Battista  Alberti  which  is  founded  upon  an 
experiment  over  a  known  distance  from  one  island  to  another,  such  an 
invention  will  work  successfully  only  with  a  ship  similar  to  that  with 
which  the  experiment  has  been  tried,  and  it  is  necessary  that  it  should 
be  carried  out  with  the  same  freight  and  the  same  extent  of  sail,  and 
with  the  sail  in  the  same  position,  and  the  waves  of  the  same  size.  But

Moreover  you  might  set  yourself  to  prove  that  by  equipping  such 
a  wheel  with  many  balances,  every  part  however  small  which  turned 
over  as  the  result  of  percussion  would  suddenly  cause  another  balance 
to  fall,  and  by  this  the  wheel  would  stand  in  perpetual  movement. 
But  by  this  you  would  be  deceiving  yourself;  for  as  there  are  these 
twelve  pieces  and  only  one  moves  to  the  percussion,  and  by  this  per- 
cussion the  wheel  may  make  such  a  movement  as  may  be  one  twen- 
tieth part  of  its  circle,  if  then  you  give  it  twenty-four  balances  the 
weight  would  be  doubled  and  the  proportion  of  the  percussion  of  the 
descending  weight  diminished  by  half,  and  by  this  the  half  of  the 
movement  would  be  lessened;  consequently  if  the  first  was  one  twen- 
tieth of  the  circle  this  second  would  be  one  fortieth,  and  it  would 
always  go  in  proportion,  continuing  to  infinity.

difference  upon  the  arms  of  the  balance,  that  is  that  experiment  which 
will  throw  you  the  sum  of  one  of  the  gravities  more  distant  from  the

[How  to  ma\e  a  pontoon] 

Since  every  river  current  is  swifter  in  the  centre  of  its  breadth  than 
at  its  sides,  and  flows  faster  on  its  surface  than  in  its  bed  when  the 
course  is  equal,  and  a  movable  bridge  made  upon  barges  is  in  itself 
weaker  in  the  middle  of  its  length  than  towards  the  extremities,  there- 
fore I  conclude  that  as  the  greater  weakness  of  the  bridge  is  accom- 
panied by  the  greater  percussion  of  the  water  this  bridge  will  break 
in  the  centre. 

Make  it  so  that  in  the  movement  of  the  bridge  the  length  of  the 
barges  will  always  find  itself  in  line  with  the  current,  when  the  move- 
ment will  be  so  much  easier  as  the  barges  receive  less  percussion  from 
the  water.  c.a.  176  r.  c

Again  a  bombard  that  takes  a  projectile  weighing  a  hundred  pounds 
is  of  considerably  more  use  in  the  field  than  a  small  cannon,  for  that 
with  pieces  of  rock  inflicts  considerable  damage  upon  the  enemy,  and 
the  small  cannon  or  rather  its  ball,  being  of  lead,  does  not  rebound 
after  the  first  blow  by  reason  of  its  weight,  and  on  this  account  it  is 
less  useful. 

If  you  set  an  arrow  so  that  it  is  just  in  equilibrium  on  top  of  a  stone 
which  seems  on  the  point  of  falling  over,  you  will  perceive  that  a  large 
bombard  if  discharged  at  a  distance  of  ten  miles  from  this  arrow  will 
cause  such  a  tremor  of  the  ground  as  to  make  the  said  arrow  fall,  or  the 
stone  upon  which  it  is  balanced. 

Again  if  you  discharge  a  small  bombard  in  a  courtyard  surrounded 
by  a  convenient  wall,  any  vessel  that  is  there  or  any  windows  covered 
with  cloth  or  linen  will  all  be  instantly  broken;  and  even  the  roofs  will 
be  somewhat  heaved  up  and  start  away  from  their  supports,  the  walls 
and  ground  will  shake  as  though  there  was  a  great  earthquake,  and 
the  webs  of  the  spiders  will  all  fall  down,  and  the  small  animals  will 
perish,  and  every  body  which  is  near  and  which  is  possessed  of  air 
will  suffer  instant  damage  and  some  measure  of  loss. 

But  this  small  bombard  should  be  discharged  without  its  shell  or  if 
you  so  desire  after  the  fashion  of  the  curtail; *  and  it  will  cause  women 
to  miscarry  and  also  every  animal  that  is  with  young,  and  the  chicks 
will  perish  in  their  shells.  c.a.  363  v.  d 

Having  to  make  mounds  of  earth  on  the  two  opposite  sides  of  the

Allowing  six  shovelfuls  to  each  hand-barrow,  and  casting  the  earth 
at  a  great  distance: 

The  diggers  d  enter  underneath  a  shovelful,  always  drawing  them- 
selves back,  and  the  diggers  b  make  another  second  shovelful  below, 
that  is  deeper  down,  always  going  forward;  and  if  there  were  two 
other  similar  lines  of  diggers  these  would  go  beneath  the  third  and 
fourth  shovelful,  and  so  successively  they  would  be  able  to  continue 
from  hand  to  hand.

808  WARFARE 

Here  many  men  become  fatigued  merely  by  taking  loads  for  so  great 
a  distance,  so  that  we  have  to  consider  whether  it  is  better  that  the  men 
should  remain  in  one  spot  and  throw  the  soil  from  one  to  another,  or 
should  all  be  employed  in  digging  and  throwing,  or  whether  some 
should  be  carriers  of  this  soil  and  others  throwers.  For  as  regards  the 
place  where  this  earth  is  discharged  it  requires  as  much  effort  for 
the  shovelful  of  the  first  or  of  the  second  to  reach  it  in  one  way  as  in 
the  other:  nothing  therefore  need  be  considered  here  except  the  con- 
venience and  endurance  of  the  workers.  c.a.  370  r.  b

If  you  are  attacked  by  night  in  your  quarters  or  if  you  fear  to  be, 
take  care  to  have  mangonels  in  readiness  which  can  throw  iron 
caltrops;  and,  if  you  should  be  attacked,  hurl  them  in  among  the 
enemy  and  you  will  gain  time  to  set  your  men  in  order  against  their 
assailants,  the  outwitted  enemies,  who  because  of  the  pain  caused  by 
the  wounds  in  their  feet,  will  be  able  to  effect  little.  And  the  plan  of 
your  attack  you  will  make  thus : — divide  your  men  into  two  squadrons 
and  so  encircle  the  enemy;  but  see  to  it  that  you  have  soles  to  your 
shoes  and  that  the  horses  are  shod  with  iron,  as  I  have  said  before, 
since  the  caltrops  will  make  no  distinction  between  your  men  and 
those  of  the  enemy,  and  see  that  each  mangonel  throws  a  cartload  of 
the  said  caltrops. 

HOW  TO  PROTECT  ONESELF  FROM  CALTROPS 

If  you  wear  between  the  foot  and  the  sole  of  the  shoe  a  sole  of  cloth 
woven  of  cords  of  cotton  of  the  thickness  of  a  finger  you  will  be  safe 
from  caltrops,  which  will  not  thrust  themselves  into  your  feet. 

If  you  wish  to  be  safe  from  light  shifting  sand  upon  the  galleys,  have 
heavy  river  sand  strewn  upon  the  gangway  and  where  you  have  to  set 
your  feet;  and  pitch  will  Rx  this,  and  keep  sacks  always  in  readiness 
for  when  they  may  be  needed.  Tr.  88  a 

You  should  make  caltrops  of  plaster  with  the  arch  of  iron  and  the 
moulds  in  three  parts,  and  then  the  points  should  be  filed.  [Below — 


WARFARE  809 

sketches  of  three  caltrops  with  four  points  and  of  one  with  eight,  each 
of  the  four  being  duplicated  close  together — below  this  is  written 
'double  caltrop'.] 

These  caltrops  should  be  kept  in  a  leather  bag  by  the  side  of  each 
person,  so  that  if  the  expected  victory  should  be  changed  to  a  defeat 
through  the  strength  of  the  enemy,  the  fact  of  these  being  scattered 
behind  them  would  be  the  cause  of  checking  the  speed  of  the  horses 
and  of  bringing  about  the  unhoped-for  victory. 

But  lest  in  retreating  this  crop  should  be  the  cause  of  a  similar  mis- 
take for  yourselves,  you  should  first  have  made  ready  the  irons  for  the 
horses  in  the  form  represented  below,  and  have  nailed  between  the 
iron  and  the  horse's  foot  a  plate  of  steel  as  thick  and  wide  as  the  above- 
mentioned  horse's  iron. 

And  in  the  case  of  foot-soldiers  they  should  have  iron  plates  fastened 
to  the  soles  of  their  shoes,  not  tied  tightly,  so  that  they  may  be  able 
easily  to  raise  their  heels  and  take  steps  and  run  when  necessary  with- 
out any  restraining  obstacle,  and  the  knot  that  is  left  loose  should  be 
as  it  is  represented  here  below. 

Moreover  if  you  have  a  small  bag  of  them  by  the  side  of  each  naval 
combatant  and  they  are  then  thrown  by  hand  on  the  enemy's  galleys 
or  ships  they  will  be  sowing  the  seed  of  the  approaching  victory;  but 
you  should  have  the  shoes  bound  with  iron,  as  was  said  above,  and 
covered  over  below  with  tiny  points,  in  order  that  if  it  should  come 
about  that  soft  soap  be  thrown  upon  your  ship  you  will  be  able  to 
keep  your  feet,  even  though  the  enemy  should  throw  chalk  in  the 
form  of  powder  in  such  a  dense  cloud  as  to  devastate  the  air  which  is 
breathed  into  the  lungs. 

You  should  set  up  four  stations  at  four  positions  in  the  length  of  the 
ship,  and  at  each  of  the  four  stations  let  there  be  a  small  barrel  with  a 
certain  quantity  of  water,  and  large  syringes  which  serve  to  force  the 
water  out  through  many  small  holes,  so  that  the  water  may  become 
changed  into  spray  and  may  thus  accompany  the  dust  of  the  chalk 
and  draw  it  downwards.

been  set  alight  are  driven  into  it,  thus  igniting  the  powder  which  is 
all  round  a  piece  of  tow  that  has  been  soaked  in  turpentine,  the  rest 
of  it  being  wrapped  in  hemp  which  also  has  been  soaked  in  turpentine, 
oil  of  flax,  and  pitch,  and  the  wrappings  should  be  thin  in  order  that 
the  flames  may  get  the  air,  for  otherwise  you  will  do  nothing. 

RHOMPHEA 

This  rhomphea  can  be  drawn  with  army  horses,  as  the  ancients  drew 
other  instruments. 

This  [small  drawing  of  instrument]  is  attached  to  the  centre  of  a 
piece  of  plank,  or  piece  of  chain,  or  stout  cord,  that  is  fastened  to  a 
lump  of  stone  heavier  than  the  plank  and  so  drawn  behind  the  plank, 
which  on  the  front  edge  is  full  of  spontoons  of  the  length  of  a  cubit, 
and  the  said  plank  will  be  twelve  braccia  long,  and  its  surface  is 
studded  with  nails.  b  7  r. 

SCORPIONS 

A  scorpion  is  a  machine  which  can  hurl  stones,  darts  and  arrows; 
and  if  it  is  made  large  it  will  be  suitable  for  breaking  the  machines  of 
the  enemy. 

Other  authors  are  of  opinion  that  a  scorpion  is  a  poisoned  arrow 
which  however  little  it  may  touch  the  blood  causes  instant  death.  And 
it  is  said  that  this  weapon  was  found  among  the  Scythians,  others 
say  among  the  inhabitants  of  Candia.  The  brew  was  made  of  human 
blood  and  serpent's  venom.  This  weapon  should  not  be  used  except 
against  traitors,  for  it  comes  from  them.  b  7  v. 

CATAPULT 

The  catapult  according  to  Nonius  and  Pliny  is  an  instrument 
invented  by  that  Ticlete,2  which  threw  a  dart  of  three  cubits,  and  with

iron  on  three  sides,  thrown  by  means  of  wood  released  from  the  con- 
traction of  twisted  sinews. 

A  bit  of  thin  steel  also  springing  back  when  released  will  have  power 
to  drive  a  dart  swiftly  when  it  stands  in  its  course.  b  8  r. 

RHOMPHEA 

The  rhomphea  is  an  instrument  which  throws  out  long  brands  of 
burning  wood;  it  was  used  among  the  Thracians  according  to  Aulus 
Gellius,  and  by  the  men  of  other  nations  it  was  called  flammea. 

THE  BOW 

The  bow  is  said  to  have  been  invented  by  the  inhabitants  of  Arcadia, 
some  say  by  Apollo;  those  of  Candia  call  it  Scythian  as  coming 
from  Scythia.  And  it  is  much  in  use  among  the  eastern  peoples.  They 
make  arrows  of  canes  for  these  bows,  and  in  their  battles  there  are 
sometimes  so  many  of  them  in  the  air  that  the  day  becomes  so 
darkened  as  to  seem  like  night.  So  for  this  reason  they  have  a  hatred 
of  the  clouds  and  the  rain  and  the  winds  no  less,  because  they  divert 
the  course  of  their  arrows;  and  these  causes  often  bring  treaties  and 
peace  among  them.  b  8  v. 

The  spikes  {murici)  or  caltrops  (triboli)  are  for  use  on  the  field  of 
battle,  in  order  to  scatter  them  on  the  side  on  which  there  is  reason  to 
expect  the  assault  of  the  enemy,  and  also  for  throwing  among  the 
enemy  when  they  follow  up  their  victory. 

The  scalpro  was  a  sharpened  iron  used  to  prick  and  control  elephants. 
Livy  in  the  Seventh  Book  of  the  Carthaginian  War  says  that  many 
more  elephants  were  killed  by  their  own  governors  than  by  the  enemy. 
For  when  these  beasts  got  enraged  with  them  the  governor  with  a 
mighty  blow  thrust  the  sharp  scalpro  between  the  ears  where  the  neck 
joins  the  spinal  column;  and  this  was  the  most  rapid  death  that  could 
be  given  to  so  huge  a  beast. 

The  veruina  according  to  what  I  find  in  a  comedy  of  Plautus  1  is  a 
long  spear  with  a  sharp  iron  point  for  hurling. 

1The  reference  is  to  Plautus's  Bacchides,  Act  4,  Scene  8,  1.  46.  Si  tibi  est  machaera, 
et  nobis  veruina  est  domi. 


812  WARFARE 

The  soliferreo  is  a  kind  of  weapon  entirely  of  iron  which  the  soldiers 
used  to  throw  at  their  first  assault.  Livy  mentions  it  in  the  fourth 
book  of  the  Macedonian  War. 

Fonda  (sling)  is  made  of  a  double  cord  and  is  somewhat  wide  where 
it  is  bent,  and  being  weighted  with  a  stone  and  then  turned  twice  in 
rapid  succession  by  the  arm  it  releases  one  of  the  cords,  and  the  stone 
flies  with  a  noise  through  the  air  as  if  it  proceeded  from  a  catapult. 
Flavius  *  says  that  it  is  found  among  the  inhabitants  of  the  Balearic 
Isles,  that  they  have  supreme  skill  in  the  use  of  it,  and  that  the  mothers 
do  not  allow  their  children  any  other  kind  of  food  than  what  has  been 
brought  down  by  them  as  a  mark  with  a  stone  shot  from  a  sling. 
Pliny  on  the  other  hand  says  that  this  sling  was  invented  by  the  Syro- 
phoenician  peoples. 

Glande  are  leaden  balls  shot  with  catapults  and  slings.  b  9  r. 

Auctori  according  to  Celidonius  are  sickle-shaped  weapons  with  a 
cutting  edge  on  one  side  only  and  the  length  of  a  braccio.  They  have 
the  handle  forked  after  the  fashion  of  the  tail  of  a  swallow.  They  are 
not  carried  in  a  sheath  but  bare,  attached  to  the  girdle. 

Danish  are  a  rather  long  kind  of  hatchet:  they  are  said  to  have  been 
much  in  use  among  the  Danish  peoples.  But  what  has  to  be  taken  into 
account  with  respect  to  instruments  of  warfare  made  of  iron  is  that 
that  which  has  been  steeped  in  oil  will  have  a  fine  edge,  and  that 
which  has  been  immersed  in  water  will  be  rough  and  brittle.  Those 
which  are  soaked  in  the  blood  of  a  goat  will  be  the  hardest.  Oil,  white 
lead  and  pitch  preserve  iron  from  all  rust. 

Voice  (scythe)  is  of  iron,  crescent-shaped,  and  with  a  staff  fastened 
to  one  of  its  horns.  This  weapon  was  much  in  use  among  the  Thracians 
and  in  naval  combats  no  less  than  on  land.  It  was  afterwards  con- 
verted for  the  use  of  husbandmen  and  peasants. 

They  were  used  by  the  Romans  upon  their  ships;  unheard  of  in 
size  and  skilfully  manipulated  by  means  of  ropes  they  severed  the  ropes 
of  the  lateen  yards  as  though  they  were  razors,  and  caused  the  sails  to 
fall  at  the  same  time  as  the  yards,  so  that  what  ought  to  have  been  a 
help  to  the  enemy  was  a  great  hindrance  to  them. 

Fragilicha  is  a  ball  half  a  foot  across,  filled  with  small  barrels  made

of  paper  and  crammed  with  pepper,  sulphur  and  ...  of  Corsica 
(conocorsico).  And  whoever  receives  the  smell  of  it  falls  in  a  swoon; 
and  in  the  centre  of  this  ball  is  the  powder  of  a  bombard  which  when 
kindled  sets  fire  to  all  the  barrels,  and  when  it  is  first  thrown  among 
the  troops  with  a  sling  the  fire  catches  a  wisp  of  straw,  and  the  sparks 
proceed  to  spread  over  a  space  of  a  hundred  braccia.  b  9  v. 


CAR  WITH  SCYTHES 

[Drawing] 

These  cars  armed  with  scythes  were  of  various  kinds  and  often  did 
no  less  injury  to  friends  than  they  did  to  enemies,  for  the  captains  of 
the  armies  thinking  by  the  use  of  these  to  throw  confusion  into  the 
ranks  of  the  enemy  created  fear  and  loss  among  their  own  men. 
Against  these  cars  one  should  employ  bowmen,  slingers  and  hurlers 
of  spears,  and  throw  all  manner  of  darts,  spears,  stones  and  bombs, 
with  beating  of  drums  and  shouting;  and  those  who  are  acting  thus 
should  be  dispersed  in  order  that  the  scythes  do  not  harm  them.  And 
by  this  means  you  will  spread  panic  among  the  horses  and  they  will 
charge  at  their  own  side  in  frenzy,  despite  the  efforts  of  their  drivers, 
and  so  cause  great  obstruction  and  loss  to  their  own  troops.  As  a  pro- 
tection against  these  the  Romans  were  accustomed  to  scatter  iron 
caltrops,  which  brought  the  horses  to  a  standstill  and  caused  them  to 
fall  down  on  the  ground  from  pain,  leaving  the  cars  without  power  of 
movement.  b  10  r. 

FOR  PASSING  A  RIVER 

You  ought  when  you  wish  to  make  the  passage  of  a  river  with  an 
army  to  make  use  of  wine-skins  attached  to  the  saddle,  and,  as  the 
horses  are  not  able  to  swim  much  on  account  of  the  waves  leaping  up, 
you  should  carry  an  oar  fastened  to  the  neck  behind  so  that  [the  rider] 
can  work  it  when  necessary.  b  10  v. 

[With  drawings:  flammea,  pilocrotho,  arzilla,  crusida,  lampade,  astula] 

The  flammea  is  a  ball  put  together  in  this  manner:  Let  the  following 

things  be  boiled  together,  the  ashes  of  willow,  saltpetre,  aqua  vitae, 

sulphur,  incense,  and  melted  pitch  with  camphor,  and   a  skein  of 


8i4  WARFARE 

Ethiopian  wool  which  after  merely  being  soaked  in  this  mixture  is 
twisted  into  the  shape  of  a  ball  and  filled  with  sharp  spikes  and  thrown 
on  ships  with  a  cord  by  means  of  a  sling. 

This  is  called  Greek  fire,  and  it  is  a  marvellous  thing  and  sets  fire  to 
everything  under  the  water.  Callimachus  the  architect  was  the  first 
to  impart  it  to  the  Romans,  by  whom  it  was  afterwards  much  employed 
and  especially  by  the  Emperor  Leo,  when  the  eastern  peoples  came 
against  Constantinople  with  an  infinite  number  of  ships  which  were 
all  set  on  fire  by  this  substance. 

Pilocrotho,  arzilla,  crusida,  flammea,  lampade,  although  they  differ 
are  nevertheless  almost  of  the  same  substance,  and  their  fire  is  similar 
to  that  spoken  of  above,  that  is  of  the  flammea  except  for  the  addition 
to  the  said  composition  of  liquid  varnish,  oil  of  petroleum,  turpentine 
and  strong  vinegar,  and  these  things  are  first  all  squeezed  together  and 
then  left  in  the  sun  to  dry,  and  afterwards  twisted  about  a  hempen 
rope  and  so  reduced  to  a  round  shape.  Afterwards  it  is  drawn  with 
a  cord,  and  some  bury  the  point  of  a  dart  in  it,  transfixing  it  after 
having  wetted  the  dart,  some  bury  very  sharp  nails  within  it;  and  a 
hole  is  left  in  the  said  ball  or  mass  for  the  purpose  of  setting  it  on  fire 
and  all  the  rest  of  it  is  smeared  with  resin  and  sulphur.  Our  fore- 
fathers made  use  of  this  compound  pressed  tightly  together  and  bound 
to  the  end  of  a  spear,  in  order  to  ward  off  and  resist  the  impetuous 
fury  of  the  enemy  ships. 

Lucan  says  that  Caesar  used  to  make  this  fire  in  order  to  throw  it  by 
means  of  lamps  upon  the  ships  of  the  Cerusci,  a  people  of  Germany; 
he  burnt  not  merely  the  said  ships,  but  the  buildings  constructed  upon 
the  borders  of  the  sea  were  consumed  by  a  similar  fire.  b  30  v. 

The  folgorea  is  a  mortar  with  an  opening  in  its  tail  circular  in 
form,  in  the  centre  of  which  occurs  a  thin  chanicula  [chamber?]  of 
iron  finely  perforated,  with  the  hollow  of  it  filled  with  fine  powder; 
and  it  is  made  thus  for  two  reasons,  first,  that  when  it  reaches  the 
centre  of  this  ball,  the  fire,  which  passes  through  the  chamber,  lights 
in  an  instant  all  the  rest  of  the  powder  that  finds  itself  pressed  within 
this  ball,  secondly,  so  that  the  hole  of  the  mortar  may  not  become 
worn.  And  this  round  opening  will  not  resist  the  might  of  the  powder 
unless  it  is  made  of  fine  copper,  but  the  rest  may  be  made  with  four 


WARFARE  815 

parts  tin  to  every  hundred  of  copper,  and  this  is  the  best  machine 
that  it  is  possible  to  make.  b  31  r. 

The  clotonbrot  is  a  ball  thrown  by  a  trabiculo,  that  is  a  lesser 
mangonel  which  is  a  braccio  high  and  rilled  with  the  ends  of  cartridges 
packed  all  together  in  a  tiny  space.  It  is  used  for  throwing  into  a 
bastion  and  there  is  no  remedy  that  avails  against  its  pestilential  effect^ 
but  for  this  purpose  its  use  would  be  a  mistake  because  it  does  damage 
to  you  as  well  as  to  the  enemy.  And  if  you  throw  six  or  eight  of  these 
balls  among  the  enemy  you  will  certainly  be  the  victor,  so  it  is  good 
to  throw  it  in  the  midst  of  them,  and  light  the  fuse  within  which  will 
at  last  set  fire  to  the  centre  of  all  the  sticks. 

This  is  for  ships. 

When  the  ships  are  engaged,  have  fuses  to  keep  the  enemy  back, 
and  at  that  moment  throw  balls  full  of  lighted  fuses  among  the 
enemy,  that  is  to  say  upon  the  ships,  and  the  enemy  being  occupied 
in  protecting  themselves  from  the  fire  will  abandon  their  defences.

[With  drawing  of  two  cannon  placed  vertically  with  stand  between 
them] 

Whoever  wishes  to  make  trial  which  is  the  better  must  raise  them 
on  end  and  two  judges  should  be  in  the  centre,  and  after  first  firing 
the  one  it  must  be  noted  how  much  time  there  is  from  the  explosion 
to  the  return  of  the  ball  to  the  ground  and  then  the  same  is  done  with 
the  other  and  the  one  which  takes  longer  will  have  the  honour. 

But  see  that  the  tubes  are  of  equal  length,  that  the  touch-holes  work 
freely,  that  the  balls  are  of  the  same  weight,  and  the  powder  is  from 
the  same  keg.  b  32  r.

If  you  wish  to  be  able  to  ford  a  river  with  your  army  when  you 
please  you  will  proceed  as  follows: — make  a  boat  of  osiers  of  willow 
and  make  it  with  the  brims  double  in  such  a  way  that  they  open  from 
below,  and  fill  the  body  of  it  with  gravel.  And  when  you  are  at  the 
place  that  you  wish,  open  the  store  of  gravel  from  below  so  as  to  cause 
it  to  fall  to  the  bottom;  after  doing  this  close  the  receptacle  and  return 
to  the  bank  to  reload.  You  will  need  to  have  a  number  of  these 


816  WARFARE 

machines,  but  the  actual  body  of  the  boat  should  be  bound  outside  with 
oxhide  to  prevent  it  falling  to  the  bottom. 

[With  drawing] 

To  make  an  airgun  which  shoots  with  marvellous  force  you  should 
proceed  as  follows : — stretch  a  steel  wire  the  width  of  a  finger  on  a  wire- 
drawing machine  by  means  of  a  windlass;  then  temper  it,  and  beat 
round  about  it  two  plates  of  fine  copper  which  you  stretch  on  the  wire- 
drawing machine.  Then  half  to  half  solder  them  together  with  silver, 
wind  thick  copper  wire  about  it  and  then  smooth  it  with  a  hammer, 
but  first  solder  it.  And  do  this  three  or  four  times  in  the  same  way. 
And  make  [the  airgun]  two  braccia  long  and  make  it  so  that  it  can 
shoot  a  dart  of  a  third  of  a  braccio  which  is  of  steel.  b  32  v. 

The  architronito  is  a  machine  of  fine  copper,  an  invention  of  Archi- 
medes, and  it  throws  iron  balls  with  a  great  noise  and  fury.  It  is  used 
in  this  manner: — the  third  part  of  the  instrument  stands  within  a 
great  quantity  of  burning  coals  and  when  it  has  been  thoroughly  heated 
by  these  it  tightens  the  screw  d  which  is  above  the  cistern  of  water 
a  b  c\  and  as  the  screw  above  becomes  tightened  it  will  cause  that 
below  to  become  loosened.  And  when  consequently  the  water  has 
fallen  out  it  will  descend  into  the  heated  part  of  the  machine,  and 
there  it  will  instantly  become  changed  into  so  much  steam  that  it  will 
seem  marvellous,  and  especially  when  one  sees  its  fury  and  hears  its 
roar.  This  machine  has  driven  a  ball  weighing  one  talent  six  stadia. 

B  33  r. 
[Fire-ball]  [With  drawing] 

This  ball  should  be  made  of  melted  pitch,  sulphur  and  tow  of  hemp 
rubbed  together  so  that  when  it  burns  the  enemy  may  not  carry  off 
the  invention. 

This  ball  should  be  two  and  a  half  braccia  in  height  and  filled  with 
tubes  which  can  throw  a  pound  of  balls,  and  these  should  be  coated 
with  pitch  within  the  tubes  so  that  they  do  not  fall. 

The  tubes  should  be  a  braccio  in  length,  and  made  of  pasteboard 
after  the  manner  of  spokes,  and  the  space  between  them  should  be 
filled  with  plaster  and  wadding;  and  the  ball  should  be  thrown  upon 
the  bastions  by  means  of  a  mangonel. 

The  centre  of  it  will  be  a  cannon-ball  to  which  the  tubes  serve  as 


WARFARE  817 

good  epaulets,  or  a  hollow  ball  of  bronze  which  may  be  partly  filled 
with  powder,  with  its  circumference  perforated  so  that  the  fire  is  able 
to  penetrate  to  the  tubes;  and  the  ball  should  be  all  tied  up  on  the 
outside  except  for  a  hole  to  serve  as  a  passage  for  the  fire,      b  37  r.

Cortalds  (short  pieces  of  artillery)  are  good  against  big  ships. 

The  serpentine  (passavolante)  is  useful  for  light  galleys  in  order  to 
be  able  to  attack  the  enemy  at  a  distance.  It  can  throw  four  pounds  of 
lead  and  ought  to  be  as  long  as  forty  cannon  balls. 

This  spontoon  will  fasten  the  instrument  into  the  ship  if  the  blow  is 
great. 

This  zepata  is  good  for  setting  fire  to  ships  which  have  kept  a  block- 
ade after  having  besieged  some  harbour  or  other  ships  in  the  harbour, 
and  it  should  be  made  thus:  first  wood  a  braccio  above  the  water, 
then  tow,  then  powder  as  used  for  a  bombard,  then  tiny  faggots  and  so 
gradually  larger  ones;  and  put  iron  wires  and  burning  rags  on  the  top; 
and  when  you  have  the  wind  as  you  want  it  direct  the  rudder.  And  as 
the  fire  m  spreads  in  the  ship  the  bent  wires  will  set  fire  to  the  powder, 
and  it  will  do  what  is  necessary. 

It  is  also  useful  for  setting  fire  to  bridges  at  night,  but  make  its  sail 
black.  b  39  v. 

NAMES  OF  WEAPONS 

Acinace.  Acinace  is  the  name  of  this  knife:  it  was  so  called  among 
the  Scythians  and  Medes,  according  to  the  statement  of  Aero. 

Daga.  This  among  the  Ligurians  was  called  daga. 

Ensis.  Gladius.  Ensis  and  gladius  are  a  kind  of  weapon,  and,  accord- 
ing to  Quintilian  in  the  tenth  book  of  his  Institutions,  they  are  the 
same  thing. 

According  to  Pliny  in  the  sixth  book  of  Natural  History,  the  gladius 
was  invented  by  the  Lacedaemonians. 

According  to  Varro,  when  the  gaesum  (javelin)  became  obsolete 
the  gladius  was  used  in  its  place.  It  has  been  called  aclis  because  it  was 
used  for  the  destruction  and  death  of  the  enemy. 

Spada,  ensis,  and  gladius  are  names  of  arms  universally  known  and 
especially  among  the  ancients.

Arpa.  Arpa,  according  to  Lucan  in  the  ninth  [book],  is  said  to  be  a 
sword  of  the  shape  of  a  sickle  with  which  Perseus  slew  the  Gorgon. 
The  bows  were  called  manubaleste.  b  41  r. 

Lingula,  according  to  what  Naevius  says  in  one  of  his  tragedies 
called  Ceisonia,  was  the  name  of  a  small  knife  of  the  shape  of  a  bird's 
tongue. 

Machaera  is  a  kind  of  long  weapon  with  one  part  of  it  sharpened. 
Caesar  mentions  it  in  the  second  of  his  Commentaries. 

Stragula  is  a  kind  of  lance  for  throwing  and  for  using  with  the 
hand.  Caesar  mentions  this  also  in  the  second  of  his  Commentaries. 

Doloni  are  a  kind  of  weapon  mentioned  by  Plutarch  in  the  life  of 
Gracchus. 

Others  are  of  the  opinion  that  doloni  are  whips  with  daggers  con-

Clunade  (clunaculurn)  is  a  sacrificial  knife. 

Secespita  is  a  long  knife  with  a  round  handle  made  of  a  piece  of 
ivory  and  ornamented  with  gold  and  silver.  It  is  used  by  the  high

Some  say  it  is  the  axe  (scura)  and  some  that  its  edge  resembles  that 
of  the  manara. 

Mucro  is  identical  with  ensis  and  gladius,  according  to  Priscian  in 
the  second  book  of  the  Ars  Grammatica. 

Aclides,  according  to  the  opinion  of  Servius,  are  a  kind  of  weapon 
so  ancient  as  to  have  been  entirely  overlooked  in  war.  Nevertheless  we 
read  that  they  were  pieces  of  wood,  some  half  a  cubit  in  length  and 
some  circular;  and  in  them  were  fixed  iron  points  which  were  sharp 
and  projected;  and  they  were  hurled  among  the  enemy  with  a  cord 
or  leathern  thongs,  and  he  who  received  the  blow  soon  knew  who  had 
given  it.  b  42  r.

Telo  (tehtm)  was  the  word  generally  applied  by  the  ancients  to  all 
those  things  which  in  war  were  suitable  to  be  thrown  with  the  hands, 
such  as  darts,  clubs,  arrows,  spears,  lances,  stakes  and  stones. 

Veruto.  The  veruto  {verutum)  (javelin),  according  to  Nonius  Mar- 
cellus,  is  a  small  weapon  and  very  straight. 

Fusti.  Fusti  {fastis)  (club)  were  the  first  weapons  that  the  human 
race  used,  and  they  are  today  called  stakes  by  countryfolk;  and  their 
points  were  somewhat  charred. 

Bacitlo.  The  baculo  (baculum)  is  a  stick  without  a  hook  to  it  with 
which  unhappy  slaves  were  beaten. 

Haste  (hastd)  (spear)  is  said  to  have  been  invented  by  the  Lacedae- 
monians. They  are  excellent  and  .  .  .?  {plestante)  when  made  of  ash 
or  hazel,  but  better  still  when  made  from  the  service  tree,  because 
this  is  more  supple  and  flexible. 

Astili  are  the  smaller  lances  which  are  thrown  deftly  with  the  hands. 

Cuncti  {conti)  are  very  long  and  stout  pikes  without  iron  but  having 
their  point  sharpened.  Lucan  makes  mention  of  them. 

Lcrncea.  Pliny  says  of  the  lance  that  it  was  invented  by  the  Aetolians. 
Varro  says  that  lancia  is  a  Spanish  word.  b  42  v. 

Pilo  {pilum)  was  a  spear  in  use  among  the  Romans,  resembling  the 
gaesum  of  the  Gauls  and  the  sarissa  of  the  Macedonians.  And  these 
spears  were  divided  in  their  length  in  two  equal  parts  and  the  heads 
were  placed  at  each  end.  They  were  joined  together  with  fish  glue  and 
at  every  half  cubit  bound  with  gut.  Writers  say  that  these  spears  were 
so  perfect  that  if  they  were  suspended  by  a  cord  in  the  form  of  a  bal- 
ance they  did  not  bend.  And  if  one  first  draws  it  back  and  then  drives 
it  forward  with  fury  there  is  no  armour  of  sufficient  strength  to  resist 
it.  They  were  much  in  use  among  the  Bretons. 

Giese  {gaesum)  is  a  weapon  used  by  the  people  of  Gaul,  and  they 
are  no  less  useful  for  hurling  than  for  use  in  any  other  way. 

Ruma,  pilum,  rumex  and  telum  resemble  each  other  and  resemble 
also  the  sparus  of  the  Gauls. 

Jaculo  (javelin)  is  said  to  have  been  invented  by  ^Etolus  the  son  of 
Mars,  and  to  this  Hermes,  Varro,  Pompeius  Festus  bear  witness,  affirm- 
ing that  javelins  are  rude  and  fashioned  by  rustics  of  poor  mean  con- 
dition but  suitable  for  scattering  on  all  sides.  b  43  r. 


820  WARFARE 

Sarissa.  Sarissa,  according  to  Pompeius  [Festus],  is  a  Macedonian 
spear. 

Gabina.  Gabina  is  the  name  given  by  the  Illyrians  to  a  certain  kind 
of  weapon  of  the  shape  of  a  hunting-spear  {yenabulum)  or  pike. 

Securis  (battle-axe)  is  called  also  semicuris  or  semiquiris. 

Tragula.  Tragula  is  a  spear  with  a  very  sharp  point  of  the  shape  of 
a  javelin  or  dart  which  can  be  thrown  by  the  hand  according  to  Varro, 
Pompeius,  and  Caesar  in  the  fifth  of  the  Commentaries. 

Clava.  Clava  [club]  is  a  kind  of  weapon  which  was  used  by  Hercules, 
and  it  was  so  called  because  it  was  a  big  strong  stick  studded  with 
sharp  nails,  and  this  in  these  rude  times  would  be  considered  a  very 
magnificent  weapon. 

Cathegia.  [Boomerang?]  Some  believe  this  clava  to  have  been  the 
cathegia  which  Horace  calls  caia  and  that  the  cathegia  was  a  kind  of 
dart  in  use  among  the  Gauls  which  comes  back  at  the  wish  of  the 
thrower.  According  to  Virgil  it  was  greatly  in  use  among  the  Germans; 
the  knights  made  a  great  use  of  it  against  the  infantry.  b  43  v. 

Dolabra,  that  is,  double-cutting. 

It  is  called  two  lips  (Jabbri)  after  what  Livy  states  in  the  eleventh 
book  x  of  the  Punic  War,  where  he  relates  that  Hannibal  sent  five  hun- 
dred Africans  armed  with  these  in  order  to  lay  waste  to  their  founda- 
tions the  walls  of  a  town. 

Bipenna.  This  weapon  is  so  called  because  it  has  a  sharp  edge  on 
both  sides.  The  term  is  usually  applied  to  it  by  Quintilian,  in  the  first 
book  of  the  Institutions.  b  44  r. 

The  cross  was  invented  among  the  Germans,  and  this  weapon  is 
said  to  be  in  the  front  rank  of  deadly  weapons,  seeing  that  if  it  is 
thrown  either  with  a  cord  or  without  among  the  ranks  of  the  enemy 
it  never  falls  there  in  vain.  And  this  because  it  runs  edgewise  through 
the  air  and  if  it  does  not  catch  the  enemy  with  one  of  its  points  it 
catches  him  with  two,  or  not  finding  the  enemy  there  it  is  driven  into 
the  ground,  where  it  inflicts  no  less  damage  upon  the  enemy  than  if  it

struck  the  horses  and  the  footsoldiers.  From  four  to  six  of  these  are 
carried  round  the  belt  when  one  goes  into  the  combat. 

[Drawing  of  caltrops  with  cord  and  thong] 

This  method  was  much  in  use  among  the  Jews  and  the  neighboring 
peoples  of  Syria.  And  they  throw  them  with  cords  and  long  thongs 
among  the  enemy  on  finding  themselves  vanquished  and  routed  by 
them;  whereby  they  being  thrown  down  are  made  to  cease  their 
course. 

And  they  also  sow  them  upon  their  own  line. 

Telico.  These  were  in  use  among  the  first  men;  and  they  were  made 
of  cane,  that  is  to  say  that  having  taken  a  piece  of  cane  with  two  knots 
they  split  one  through  the  middle  and  used  it  as  the  feather  of  the 
arrow;  and  the  other  they  made  into  a  point  and  filled  it  with  earth  so 
as  to  weight  it,  and  they  threw  these  by  means  of  a  cord.       b  44  v. 

Scourge  (flagellum) .  This  also  was  among  the  number  of  the  primi- 
tive and  rustic  arms. 

Scythian  arrow.  The  arrow  is  a  simple  weapon  which  was  much  in 
use  among  the  Arabs.  It  was  invented  by  the  Scythians,  and  consists  of 
a  piece  of  green  wood  of  which  the  end  has  been  burnt;  and  it  may  be 
thrown  either  by  means  of  a  cord  or  without.  If  it  is  held  it  may  be 
used  also  as  a  javelin. 

Ganci,  ruffili  and  roncili  are  maritime  weapons  in  use  among  pirates. 
By  means  of  hooks  they  are  accustomed  to  grapple  the  edges  of  ships, 
and  if  any  of  the  ship's  defenders  should  approach  them  they  wound 
them  and  drive  them  before  them,  and  then  return  to  the  edges  where 
they  were  before  and  dig  them  deep  into  the  ships  so  that  they  cannot 
escape.  b  45  r. 

Sirile  is  a  very  long  spear;  it  was  found  among  the  Numidians.  They 
often  used  it  in  order  to  throw  down  their  enemies,  and  they  rode  on 
horseback  without  saddle  or  stirrup,  armed  only  with  a  doublet  stuffed 
with  cotton  over  which  were  fastened  the  hooks  of  the  long  sirile;  and 
[the  enemy]  taken  by  surprise  were  easily  thrown  down. 

Cariffe  is  a  broad  spear  with  which  one  can  attack  from  afar.  And  if 
it  should  come  about  that  the  combustible  ball  should  be  captured,  the 
soldier  can  start  it  by  striking  it  with  the  sharp  iron  point  that  is  at  the 


822  WARFARE 

head  of  the  spear,  and  thus  recovering  it  would  scourge  the  wretched 
soldiers  [of  the  enemy]. 

Miricide  is  a  spear  three  braccia  in  length,  and  five  braccia  and  a 
half  when  extended:  the  soldiers  use  it  in  the  way  in  which  rustics 
thresh  corn. 

Maicoli,  according  to  Ammianus  Marcellinus,  are  a  kind  of  dart  or 
arrow.  The  stem  is  of  cane  and  where  the  cane  ends  a  distaff  is  joined 
like  that  used  for  spinning,  and  on  this  distaff  the  iron  is  fixed.  Tow 
steeped  in  pitch  should  be  placed  in  the  hollow  of  the  said  distaff,  and 
it  should  be  set  fire  to  and  thrown  gently  so  that  the  rush  of  the  air 
may  not  extinguish  it.  Some  say  that  within  this  cavity  there  should 
be  an  inexhaustible  store  which  should  consist  of  resin,  sulphur,  and 
saltpetre  which  should  have  been  liquified  with  oil  of  laurel,  or  some 
say  petroleum  oil  l  and  fat  of  duck,  and  marrow  of  meat,  and  fennel, 
and  sulphur,  resin  and  camphor  with  .  .  .  [rasa?]  and  tow.  This  mix- 
ture among  the  ancients  was  called  combustible,  that  is  something 
suitable  to  burn,  also  tow,  fat,  and  petroleum.  b  45  v. 

The  Manara  was  much  in  use  among  the  Romans. 

Irish  and  English  bows.  But  the  Irish  in  place  of  one  corner  of  the 
bow  have  a  piece  of  sharpened  iron  of  the  length  of  a  cubit. 

The  English  and  the  Irish  are  almost  the  same  length,  that  is  four 
braccia  each. 

Syrian  bow,  made  of  horns  of  buffalo. 

German  bow,  made  of  two  pieces  of  steel  and  how  they  are  set. 

The  dart  of  the  cross-bow  works  in  this  manner:  namely,  when  the 
arrow  issues  forth  from  the  cord  and  passes  over  the  roller,  the  ring 
at  the  extremity  of  the  arrow  causes  it  to  leap  back  after  it  has  struck; 
but  the  iron  continues  and  performs  its  function. 

The  dart  of  the  bow  by  which  the  arrow  remains  attached  to  the 
cord  is  an  awl  a  quarter  of  a  braccio  in  length,  all  of  iron  finely 
tempered;  the  feathers  of  the  tail  come  away  from  the  arrow  as  it  flies 
on  its  way.  Some  there  are  which  make  a  prick  resembling  that  of  a 
needle  full  of  poison.  b  46  r.

tion.  The  said  carabineers  should  be  provided  with  pouches  full  of 
rolls  of  plain  paper  filled  with  powder,  so  that  by  frequently  inserting 
them  they  subdue  the  excessive  numbers  of  the  enemy.  And  these 
carabineers  should  stand  in  squadrons  as  do  cross-bowmen,  so  that 
when  one  part  fires  the  other  loads;  but  first  make  sure  that  you  have 
accustomed  the  horses  to  such  noises;  or  else  stop  up  their  ears. 

Order  of  mounted  cross-bowmen  on  the  open  field:  m  n  are  cross- 
bowmen  who  as  they  turn  left  draw  back  loading,  r  t  are  those  who  go 
forward  with  cross-bows  loaded,  and  these  four  files  are  for  one  route; 
a  b  are  four  files  of  cross-bowmen  who  turn  with  bows  unloaded  in 
order  to  load  them  anew;  c  d  are  those  who  come  upon  the  enemy 
with  their  bows  loaded;  and  this  arrangement  of  eight  lines  is 
employed  in  open  field. 

And  have  it  so  that  those  who  have  unloaded  come  through  the 
centre,  so  that  if  sometimes  they  have  been  routed  by  the  enemy  the 
cross-bowmen  who  are  loaded,  holding  themselves  on  the  flanks,  may 
cause  greater  fear  to  these  same  enemies. 

Order  of  mounted  carabineers: 

See  that  they  are  well  supplied  with  guns  with  a  thin  single  fold 
of  paper  filled  with  powder  with  the  ball  within,  so  that  they  have 
only  to  put  it  in  and  set  alight.  Being  thus  ready  they  will  have  no 
need  to  turn  as  have  the  cross-bowmen  when  they  are  preparing  to 
load.  b  46  v. 

If  anyone  had  formed  the  design  of  capturing  a  tower  situated  on 
the  sea,  he  would  cause  one  of  his  followers  to  take  service  with  the 
commander,  and  when  the  guard  was  withdrawn  he  would  affix  to  the 
battlements  the  rope-ladder  given  him  by  the  enemy  and  would  fill 
the  walls  with  soldiers.  In  order  to  prevent  this,  you  should  divide 
the  tower  into  eight  sets  of  staircases,  spiral  in  shape,  and  divide  into 
eight  parts  the  ramparts  and  the  soldiers'  dwellings  below;  then,  if 
one  of  the  mercenaries  should  be  disposed  to  be  a  traitor,  the  others 
cannot  hold  communications  with  him,  and  the  section  of  the  rampart 
will  be  so  small  that  there  will  not  be  able  to  be  more  than  four  there. 
The  commander,  whose  quarters  are  above  those  of  all  the  others, 
can  drive  them  out  by  attacking  them  from  the  machicolations,  or  shut 
them  up  by  means  of  the  portcullis  and  then  put  smoke  at  the  entrance 


824  WARFARE 

to  the  spiral  staircases.  On  no  account  is  it  necessary  that  any  alien 
soldier  should  lodge  with  the  commander,  but  only  his  own  family.

The  confederate  of  the  scaler  of  the  wall  should  carry  with  him  a 
ball  of  strong  thread  when  he  takes  service  with  the  commander,  and 
when  the  opportunity  comes  the  guard  will  draw  up  with  this  thread 
a  coil  of  strong  twine  which  has  been  given  him  by  the  scaler,  and 
then  with  the  twine  he  may  draw  up  the  rope  which  will  afterwards 
be  useful  for  drawing  up  the  rope-ladder  as  shown  above,      b  50  r.

as  the  point  buries  itself  the  corners  are  pressed  closer  together  and  set

constructions;  and  no  one  will  make  good  work  in  this  business  of 
burning  unless  the  fire  is  kindled  only  after  the  dart  has  struck,

If  you  have  not  any  information  from  within  as  to  who  will  draw  up 
the  rope-ladders,  you  will  ascend  first  by  placing  these  irons  in  the 
crevices  a  braccio's  space  apart  in  the  manner  shown  above. 

And  when  you  are  at  the  top,  fix  the  rope-ladder  where  you  see  here 
the  iron  m;  let  it  be  bound  with  tow  so  that  you  do  not  make  any 
sound  and  there  remain.  Then  if  it  should  seem  that  you  ought  to 
draw  up  other  ladders,  do  so;  if  not,  cause  the  assailants  to  ascend 
quickly.  The  hook  which  is  attached  to  a  brace  of  ropes  has  above  it  a 
ring  to  which  is  fixed  a  rope,  and  this  is  drawn  up  by  a  jack  to  the 
iron  above,  and  to  this  you  attach  a  second  time  the  hook  of  the  above- 
mentioned  braces. 

These  ladders  are  made  to  carry  two  men.  They  are  also  useful  for 
a  tower  where  you  are  afraid  lest  the  rope-ladder  may  be  detached  by 
the  enemy;  they  should  be  driven  so  far  into  the  wall  that  three  eighths 
[of  a  braccio]  is  buried  and  one  eighth  is  free.  These  pyramidal  irons 
should  be  half  a  braccio  in  length  and  their  distance  apart  half  a 
braccio.  b  59  v.

SACKS  FOR  USE  IN  CROSSING  OVER  WATER 

It  is  also  necessary  to  reflect  how  one  ought  at  one's  convenience  to 
make  the  passage  of  rivers.  First  set  a  man  upon  two  bags  bound  to- 
gether, then  if  you  find  the  bottom  to  be  suitable  and  that  the  river  is 
dangerous  through  the  rapidity  of  its  course  make  use  of  the  method 
represented  below. 

If  the  river  is  dangerous  by  reason  of  its  current  you  should  set  two 
lines  of  horses  across  the  river  at  a  distance  of  six  braccia  one  from  the 
other,  and  the  horses  in  the  lines  should  be  so  near  as  almost  to  touch 
each  other,  and  the  line  or  company  of  horses  should  have  their  heads 
turned  towards  the  current  of  the  water,  and  this  is  done  solely  in  order 
to  check  and  break  the  fury  and  impetus  of  the  water.  And  between  the 
one  company  and  the  other  pass  the  soldiers  both  those  with  and  those 


828  WARFARE 

without  arms.  The  company  that  is  higher  up  the  stream  should  be 
made  up  of  the  bigger  horses  in  order  to  be  better  able  to  stem  the  rush 
of  the  river,  that  lower  down  serves  to  hold  up  the  soldiers  when  they 
fall,  and  to  act  as  a  support  for  them  as  they  make  the  passage.

The  method  in  which  the  Germans  when  in  close  order  link  together 
and  interweave  their  long  lances  against  the  enemy,  stooping  down  and

their  hands.

If  the  water  is  so  high  that  infantry  and  cavalry  cannot  pass,  the  river 
should  be  diminished  by  leading  off  many  streams,  as  Cyrus,  King  of 
the  Persians,  did  at  the  taking  of  Babylon  upon  the  river  Ganges  [sic] 
which  at  its  maximum  breadth  is  ten  thousand  braccia,  Alexander  like- 
wise upon  the  same  river,  Caesar  upon  the  river  Sicoris. 

If  it  should  come  to  pass  that  the  river  was  so  deep  that  one  could 
not  cross  it  by  fording,  the  captain  ought  to  make  a  sufficient  number  of 
streams  to  carry  off  the  water  and  afterwards  give  it  back  below  to  the 
river,  and  in  this  way  the  river  would  come  to  be  lowered  and  could  be 
crossed  with  ease.  Alexander  employed  this  method  in  India  against 
King  Porus  at  the  passage  of  the  river  Hydaspes,  and  Caesar  did  the 
same  in  Gaul  (and  also  in  Spain)  upon  the  river  Loire;  having  ar- 
ranged his  cavalry  in  two  companies  he  caused  the  soldiers  to  pass 
through  the  middle  of  them.  Hannibal  did  the  same  on  the  Po  with 
elephants.  b  61  r.

The  Egyptians,  the  Ethiopians  and  the  Arabs  in  crossing  the  Nile  are 
accustomed  to  fasten  bags  or  wine-skins  to  the  sides  of  the  forequarters 
of  the  camels  in  the  manner  shown  below. 

In  these  four  rings  in  the  net  the  baggage-camels  put  their  feet. 

The  Assyrians  and  the  inhabitants  of  Euboea  accustom  their  horses

them  instead  of  saddle-bows  above  and  at  the  side  and  well  covered 


WARFARE  829 

with  plates  of  dressed  leather,  so  that  a  quantity  of  arrows  will  not 
penetrate  them,  since  they  are  no  less  concerned  about  a  safe  means  of 
escape  than  the  hazard  of  victory.  Thus  equipped  a  horse  enables  four 
or  five  men  to  cross  at  need.  b  61  v. 

[Hon'  infantry  cross  rivers] 

If  it  should  come  to  pass  that  infantry  have  to  pass  a  river  which  is 
dangerous  by  reason  of  the  force  of  its  current,  this  is  a  sure  way: — let 
the  soldiers  join  arms  one  with  another  and  form  themselves  into  a  line 
after  the  manner  of  a  stockade,  linked  together  by  their  arms;  and  let 
these  files  advance  along  the  line  of  the  water  and  let  no  one  go  across 
its  course,  and  this  is  a  sure  way  because  the  first  being  above  the  water 
is  the  one  who  sustains  its  first  onset,  and  if  he  was  alone  the  water 
would  throw  him  down,  but  all  the  others  below  him  hold  him  up  and 
use  him  as  their  shield;  and  so  by  this  means  one  after  another  they 
cross  in  safety.  So  it  is  with  all:  and  if  the  fall  of  the  river  is  from  right 
to  left  each  man  in  the  file  as  he  proceeds  from  the  first  to  the  second 
bank  ruffles  the  course  of  the  stream  with  his  right  shoulder,  and  on  his 
left  he  has  the  right  shoulder  of  his  companion  and  the  flowing  water.

The  small  boats  in  use  among  the  Assyrians  were  made  of  thin 
branches  of  willow,  plaited  over  rods  also  of  willow,  arranged  in  the 
shape  of  a  small  boat,  plastered  over  with  fine  dust  soaked  in  oil  or 
turpentine  and  so  reduced  to  a  state  of  mud;  this  was  impervious  to 
water  and  was  not  cleft  asunder  by  blows  because  it  always  remained 
supple. 

Caesar  covered  this  kind  of  small  boat  with  oxhide  when  crossing

How  to  discharge  a  torrent  of  water  on  the  back  of  an  army  and  the 
bridges  and  walls  of  a  town. 

If  you  wish  to  submerge  a  battlefield  or  to  break  through  walls  with- 
out the  use  of  cannon  and  have  the  use  of  a  river,  do  as  is  represented 
above.  That  is  you  set  piles  as  high  as  the  bank  of  the  river  and  put 
them  half  a  braccio  apart  or  farther  if  you  have  wider  planks;  then  set 
these  planks  between  each  of  the  piles  and  so  fill  up  [the  spaces].  When 
these  are  filled  up  raise  the  connecting  rod  M,  then  a  the  upper  part  of 
the  plank  will  go  forward  and  b  the  lower  part  of  the  plank  will  go 
back.  In  this  way  the  parts  of  the  said  plank  will  be  edgewise  and  the 
water  will  be  free  to  escape.  And  make  the  sluices  all  to  open  at  the 
blow  of  a  carbine  or  other  signal  so  that  they  may  all  open  at  the  same 
time,  in  order  that  the  flow  of  the  water  upon  the  object  which  opposes 
it  may  be  driven  by  a  greater  blow  and  a  more  impetuous  force.  And  if 
the  river  have  a  steep  descent  make  one  of  these  every  half  mile,  and  let 
each  of  the  panels  open  by  means  of  a  rope  to  insure  them  working 
together,  and  in  order  that  he  who  unlocks  them  may  be  in  safety.

A  METHOD  OF  CONSTRUCTING  A  BASTION   [AT  NIGHT] 

If  you  should  be  making  a  bastion  at  night  and  have  need  of  light, 
place  these  lights  inside  lanterns  and  raise  them  up  on  the  top  of  long 
poles,  in  order  that  the  enemy  by  firing  at  the  lights  may  not  touch  the 
sappers.  And  the  lights  should  be  of  oil  so  that  they  may  last  some  time, 
and  the  lanterns  should  be  balanced  in  lamp-stands  in  this  way  [draw- 


WARFARE  831 

ing  in  text]  so  that  they  do  not  upset  when  they  are  raised.  And 
remember  that  the  poles  must  be  painted  black  and  only  erected  at  sun- 
set, so  that  the  light  is  scarcely  visible  and  the  raising  of  it  up  is  hardly 
seen  by  the  enemy.  And  it  should  be  done  as  noiselessly  as  possible,  and 
there  should  be  one  overseer  with  a  staff  for  every  five  sappers,  so  that 
the  work  may  be  rapid.  b  70  r. 

In  what  way  one  may  storm  a  bastion  which  has  been  made  in  order 
to  close  a  passage. 

Make  portable  sections  of  bastions  for  a  furious  attack  by  the  men; 
these  should  be  filled  with  hay  and  they  should  be  pointed  in  front  in 
order  that  the  blows  of  the  artillery  may  do  no  damage,  and  joined  to- 
gether so  as  to  make  the  bastion  of  such  a  size  as  to  engage  all  the 
mouths  of  the  artillery  and  the  discharge  from  the  bridges,  they  will  be 
able  to  engage  the  enemy  with  advantage.  b  75  v. 

[How  to  attac\  a  fortress  by  subterranean  galleries]  [With  drawings] 

Rod  filled  with  rockets  for  encountering  the  enemy  at  the  outlet  of

Rod  with  rockets  for  placing  in  a  gallery  that  leads  into  a  cellar 
which  would  be  in  a  fortress  and  would  be  well  guarded. 

m  a  b.  The  way  of  a  winding  gallery  that  will  deceive  the  enemy 
when  besieged. 

We  can  clearly  understand  that  all  those  who  find  themselves  be- 
sieged, employ  all  those  methods  which  are  likely  to  lead  to  the  dis- 
covery of  the  secret  stratagems  of  the  besieger.  You  therefore  who  seek 
by  subterranean  ways  to  accomplish  your  desire,  reflect  well  how  your 
enemy  will  be  on  the  alert,  and  how  if  you  should  make  a  gallery  on 
one  side  he  will  make  a  trench  up  to  your  [gallery],  and  this  will  be 
well  guarded  by  day  and  by  night,  for  it  will  be  supposed  that  the  secret 
way  as  is  natural,  has  its  outlet  in  the  said  gallery. 

When  therefore  by  your  digging  operations  you  show  that  you  wish 
to  come  out  in  one  particular  spot,  and  by  making  the  circuit  of  the 
fortress  you  come  out  at  the  opposite  side,  as  it  is  shown  above  in  m  b

Stlocladle.  Place  in  the  centre  powder  formed  of  dried  fungi. 

These  balls  filled  with  rockets  are  to  be  thrown  within  the  bastions 
of  the  enemy. 

The  stlocladle  is  a  ball  a  foot  wide  which  is  made  up  of  hemp  and 
fish-glue  and  is  covered  with  the  tails  of  rockets,  and  these  tails  do  not 
exceed  in  length  the  length  of  a  finger,  and  each  tail  is  of  fine  copper 
veined  or  of  sized  pasteboard,  and  all  the  said  tails  have  their  extremi- 
ties pierced  by  a  tiny  hole,  and  they  are  all  attached  to  a  copper  ball 
which  is  full  of  many  paths  after  the  manner  of  a  labyrinth,  filled  with 
powder;  and  the  said  paths  are  full  of  holes  that  cross  them  which 
meet  with  the  holes  of  the  rockets. 

Then  one  sets  fire  to  it  by  means  of  a  bellows  and  the  fire  hurls  itself 
through  eight  holes  so  that  no  one  can  control  it  or  .  .  .  [ariegi?],  and 
when  the  fire  has  penetrated  to  the  centre  the  rockets  begin  suddenly 
one  after  another  with  a  dreadful  din  to  spit  forth  their  deadly  missiles. 
If  you  wish  to  make  use  of  it  on  a  galley  make  the  rockets  of  paste- 
board, and  fill  the  space  between  each  with  pitch  mixed  with  powdered 
sulphur;  and  this  will  serve  three  purposes:  first  it  will  do  harm  with 
the  rockets,  second  it  will  kindle  a  fire  there  which  cannot  be  put  out, 
and  will  burn  the  wood,  and  (third)  no  one  will  be  able  to  approach  it 
because  of  the  great  stench. 

Buffonico.  The  buffonico  is  an  instrument  set  at  the  end  of  a  lance. 
It  is  two  braccia  long  and  an  eighth  of  a  braccio  thick.  It  is  shod  with 
iron  and  has  a  thin  tube  with  the  sight  placed  on  the  extremity  through 
which  it  passes  to  the  fire. 

First  of  all  fill  the  cannon  with  the  powder  well  crammed,  pressed, 
and  beaten  through  the  mouth  a  b,  then  make  a  small  hole  an  eighth 
of  a  braccio  long  and  insert  a  small  tube  with  a  very  fine  hole.  The 
powder  should  be  fine  and  mixed  with  dust  of  lead  made  with  a  file  or 
by  fire;  and  it  will  cause  great  terror  and  loss  to  the  horses  and  to  the 
enemy.  b  80  v.

THAT  MURAL  ENGINE  WHICH  MAKES  THE  LOUDER  NOISE 
HAS  THE  LESS  FORCE 

This  is  proved  by  the  ninth,  'Concerning  Percussion',  which  says: 
of  things  movable,  in  proportion  to  the  power  of  the  mover  and  the 
resistance  of  the  medium,  that  which  in  like  movement  strikes  with  a 
larger  part  of  itself  will  make  a  louder  noise  and  a  less  violent  impact; 
and  that  on  the  other  hand  which  strikes  with  a  less  part  of  itself  will 
make  a  less  noise  and  penetrate  farther  into  the  place  where  it  has 
struck.  An  example  has  been  cited  of  a  sword  striking  first  with  the  flat 
and  then  with  the  edge,  for  in  the  one  case  the  stroke  makes  a  great 
noise  and  penetrates  a  very  little  way  and  in  the  other  it  penetrates  a 
long  way  and  makes  but  little  noise.  As  the  flame  therefore  is  in  pro- 
portion to  the  projectiles  driven  by  the  pieces  of  ordnance  which  are 
thus  in  the  medium  proportioned  to  them,  that  flame  which  separates 
least  after  emerging  from  the  piece  of  ordnance  will  be  that  which  will 
drive  the  ball  out  with  most  impetus,  and  the  flame  that  separates 
rapidly  will  do  the  contrary. 

OF  PIECES  OF  ORDNANCE  THAT  HURL  MANY  BALLS  AT 
ONE  DISCHARGE 

A  piece  of  ordnance  which  throws  a  ball  a  distance  proportionate  to 
its  force,  will  in  the  same  time  throw  six  of  the  same  balls  a  sixth  part 
of  the  aforesaid  distance.  e  27  v. 

OF  PIECES  OF  ARTILLERY  AND  THE  WEIGHTS  OF  PRO- 
JECTILES PROPORTIONATE  TO  THEIR  FORCE 

Of  the  chambers  or  receptacles  for  powder  of  pieces  of  artillery  one 
finds  three  vprieties  of  shapes;  of  which  one  is  wide  at  the  bottom  and 


834  WARFARE 

narrow  at  the  mouth;  another  narrow  at  the  bottom  and  wide  at  the 
mouth;  the  third  is  of  uniform  width. 

There  are  four  [  ?five]  places  at  which  one  sets  fire  to  pieces  of  artil- 
lery. Of  these  one  is  the  extreme  upper  part  of  the  bottom  of  the  cham- 
ber; another  is  at  the  middle  of  the  bottom  of  this  chamber;  the  third 
is  as  far  removed  from  the  bottom  of  this  chamber  as  half  the  diameter 
of  the  circle  of  this  bottom;  the  fourth  receives  the  fire  in  the  same 
position  as  the  third  but  in  the  centre  of  the  thickness  of  the  powder;  in 
the  fifth  the  chamber  is  round  and  the  fire  is  set  in  the  centre  of  the 
chamber.  But  this  instrument  and  the  others  which  set  the  powder 
alight  in  very  quick  time  ought  to  be  of  fine  substance  and  well  com- 
pressed. This  compression  occurs  very  rarely  when  the  cast  is  of  great 
thickness,  because  in  the  case  of  these  the  metal  remains  liquid  longer 
in  proportion  as  they  are  thicker,  and  because  the  parts  of  it  which  are 
most  distant  from  the  centre  of  this  thickness  are  those  which  are 
compressed  first.  e  28  r.

pounds.

it  is  better  to  make  the  ball  long  or  no.

[For  digging  trenches] 
[With  plan] 

At  this  commencement  of  the  excavations  of  the  trenches  you  have  to 
place  men  according  to  the  marks  shown.  And  first  of  all  make  the 
excavation  as  far  as  possible  from  the  place  where  the  earth  is  tossed. 
For  example,  the  earth  is  excavated  at  a  g,  it  is  carried  along  the  line 
r  c,  unloaded  by  the  line  c  f,  and  then  the  man  turns  back  along  the 
line  /  d  and  loads  by  the  line  r  d,  being  always  in  movement. 

There  is  no  other  movement  here  as  useful  as  that  which  removes  the 
soil  from  the  place  where  the  line  r  c  is  marked.  l  24  r.

[Mines] 

If  you  wish  to  find  out  where  a  mine  runs  set  a  drum  over  all  the 
places  where  you  suspect  the  mine  is  being  made  and  on  this  drum  set 
a  pair  of  dice,  and  when  you  are  near  the  place  where  the  mining  is  the 
dice  will  jump  up  a  little  on  the  drum,  through  the  blow  given  under-

There  are  some  who  having  the  advantage  of  a  river  or  swamps  upon 
their  land  have  made  a  great  reservoir  near  the  place  where  they  suspect 
that  the  mine  may  be  made,  and  have  made  a  tunnel  in  the  direction  of 
the  enemy,  and  having  found  them  have  unlocked  the  waters  of  the 
reservoir  upon  them  and  drowned  a  great  number  of  people  in  the 
mine.  m.s.  2037  Bib.  Nat.  1  r. 

The  shields  of  footsoldiers  ought  to  be  of  cotton  spun  into  thread 
and  made  into  cords;  these  should  be  woven  tightly  in  a  circle  after  the 
fashion  of  a  buckler. 

And  if  you  so  wish  the  threads  should  be  thoroughly  moistened 
before  you  make  cords  of  them,  and  then  smeared  with  the  dross  of 
iron  reduced  to  powder. 

Then  plait  it  in  cords  a  second  time  with  two,  then  with  four,  then 
with  eight,  and  soak  them  every  time  in  water  with  borax  or  linseed  or 
the  seed  of  quinces.  And  when  you  have  made  your  cord  weave  the 
shield.  And  if  you  make  a  doublet  let  it  be  supple,  light  and  impene- 
trable, ms.  2037  Bib.  Nat.  7  r. 

If  it  should  happen  when  a  town  is  besieged  that  the  mines  made  by 
the  enemy  have  not  penetrated  within  it,  you  should  place  men  with 
the  greatest  possible  care  at  intervals  of  ten  braccia  in  that  quarter  in 
which  your  suspicions  centre,  with  their  ears  on  the  ground,  and  as 
soon  as  the  tremor  of  the  sound  reaches  them,  let  them  make  a  very 
deep  trench  crosswise,  which  will  be  ready  to  swallow  up  the  mine 
when  it  comes  upon  it.  Then  have  ready  a  vessel  of  iron  or  copper 
perforated  at  the  bottom,  and  in  the  hole  have  placed  the  nozzle  of  a 
smith's  bellows,  and  then  cover  over  the  mouth  with  a  plate  of  iron, 
perforated  in  many  places,  and  fill  it  with  fine  feathers;  and  you  turn 
the  mouth  in  the  direction  of  the  mine  when  it  is  discovered  and  blow 
with  the  bellows,  after  having  first  caused  the  bellows  to  be  mixed  with 
sulphur  and  burnt,  and  the  smoke  that  issues  forth  will  drive  away  the 
enemy. 

If  however  you  do  not  wish  to  make  the  above-named  trench  within 
the  circuit  of  the  walls,  in  order  not  to  interfere  with  the  rounds  of  the 
soldiers  who  are  defending  the  walls,  you  should  make  a  drill  as  was 
shown  above,  and  with  this  at  intervals  of  two  braccia  you  make  a  hole 
six  braccia  in  depth,  and  make  these  in  a  circular  line  within  the  walls 


WARFARE  839 

following  the  circle  of  the  walls,  and  let  it  be  as  long  as  you  suspect  the 
mine  to  be.  And  every  hour  you  excavate  these  holes  one  by  one  and 
measure  them  afresh  within  with  a  rod,  comparing  with  them  the 
former  measurements  of  the  holes,  and  if  the  rod  should  sink  down 
then  know  that  the  mine  is  there  and  cause  them  to  dig  there  and 
there  make  your  defence. 

Or  if  you  do  not  wish  to  make  the  test  with  the  rod  in  order  to 
discover  a  mine,  go  every  hour  with  a  light  above  each  hole,  and  when 
you  come  to  the  hole  which  is  above  the  mine  the  light  will  be  imme- 
diately extinguished.  ms.  2037  Bib.  Nat.  8  v.

Prove  in  the  model  of  the  mangonel,  which  does  not  become

further  in  respect  of  the  throwing  of  the  same  weight  see  how  to  vary 
the  counterpoise  for  the  mangonel.  Forster  11  8  r. 

Remember  that  the  more  powder  there  is  in  the  carbine  the  more  the 
length  of  the  barrel  is  diminished,  so  that  you  have  to  pay  attention  to 
the  proportions  of  your  forces.  Forster  11  39  r. 

If  you  wish  to  escape  from  a  city  or  other  closed-in  place,  fill  the

it  is  discharged.  Forster  11  58  r. 

OF  PERCUSSION 

Make  a  rule  to  apply  to  every  description  of  ball,  of  iron  as  of  lead 
or  stone,  how  you  ought  to  increase  or  diminish  the  amount  of  powder. 

Forster  11  62  r. 


OF  THE  SPEED  OF  BOMBARDS  WITH  EQUAL  TIME,  POWDER 
AND  WEIGHT  OF  BALL 

Of  many  bombards  equal  in  respect  of  powder  and  ball,  that  from 
which  in  equal  time  there  is  kindled  a  greater  quantity  of  fire,  will 
hurl  its  ball  more  swiftly  and  to  a  greater  distance. 

Of  balls  of  equal  weight  that  which  is  the  swifter  will  seem  heavier 
and  will  produce  a  greater  percussion.  Forster  11  71  r. 

If  the  bombard  has  its  stone  flattened  like  a  cheese,  and  the  hollow 
of  the  bombard  has  a  like  shape,  and  the  centre — the  centre  of  the  tail — 
does  not  encounter  the  centre  of  the  stone,  so  that  it  goes  revolving 
through  the  air,  it  will  undoubtedly  be  exceedingly  swift. 

For  if  you  take  a  ball  of  six  ounces  and  a  wheel  of  like  weight 
without  angles  at  its  edges,  you  will  see  how  much  greater  a  distance 
the  one  will  be  sent  by  its  mover  than  the  other;  and  this  is  also  due  in 
part  to  the  revolving  of  its  additional  substance.  And  this  happens 
because  as  the  balls  are  equal  in  weight,  from  being  round  it  strikes 
more  air  and  finds  more  resistance,  and  from  being  flattened  it  enters

many  as  you  please  provided  that  the  number  is  not  uneven,  since  in 
order  that  the  blow  may  be  a  vigorous  one  and  yet  the  vessel  may  not 
spring  back  it  is  necessary  that  one  bombard  should  serve  as  a  support 
and  obstacle  of  another,  and  in  order  to  effect  this  it  is  necessary  to 
set  fire  at  the  same  instant  to  two  bombards  placed  opposite  to  each 
other,  so  that  if  one  wishes  to  flee  on  one  side  the  other  opposes  it.

HOW  TO  STAVE  IN  THE  BOWS  OF  A  SHIP 

[With  drawing] 

It  is  necessary  first  that  they  be  engaged,  that  is  fastened  together 
in  such  a  way  that  you  for  your  part  can  unlock  yourself  at  your 
pleasure,  so  that  when  the  ship  goes  to  the  bottom  it  may  not  drag 
yours  with  it.  Let  this  be  done  as  follows: — draw  a  weight  up  to  a 
height  and  then  release  it;  and  as  it  falls  it  will  give  such  a  blow  as  a 
pile-driver  gives,  and  in  falling  it  will  draw  back  the  head  of  a  beam 
which  is  in  equilibrium  when  upright,  and  as  the  head  of  the  afore- 
said beam  comes  back  the  end  that  is  below  advances  and  staves  in 
the  bow  of  the  ship.  But  see  to  it  that  the  beam  has  a  cutting  edge  so 
that  as  it  rushes  to  give  the  stroke  the  water  does  not  offer  resistance 
to  it.  And  above  all  see  that  the  chains  which  hold  the  ships  fastened 
together  are  such  as  can  at  your  pleasure  be  severed  from  your  side, 
so  that  the  enemy's  ship  when  it  sinks  may  not  drag  you  down  with  it.

If  in  a  battle  between  ships  and  galleys  the  ships  are  victors  because 
of  the  height  of  their  mast-heads,  you  should  draw  the  lateen  yard 
almost  up  to  the  top  of  the  mast  and  attach  to  the  extremity  of  this 
yard — at  the  end  that  is  which  projects  towards  the  enemy — a  small 
cage  wrapped  at  the  bottom  and  all  round  with  a  large  mattress 
stuffed  with  cotton  to  prevent  it  from  being  damaged  by  bombs. 

Then  draw  down  the  other  end  of  the  lateen  yard  by  means  of  the 
capstan,  and  the  cage  at  the  opposite  end  will  go  up  to  such  a  height 
that  it  will  be  far  above  the  mast-head  of  the  ship,  and  you  will  easily 
be  able  to  drive  out  the  men  who  are  within  it.

If  you  wish  to  build  a  fleet  for  action  you  should  make  use  of  these 
ships  in  order  to  ram  the  enemy's  ships,  that  is,  make  ships  a  hundred 
feet x  in  length  and  eight  feet  wide  and  arrange  them  so  that  the 
rowers  of  the  left  oars  sit  on  the  right  side  of  the  ship  and  the  rowers 
of  the  right  oars  on  the  left  side,  as  is  shown  at  M  {figure),  in  order 
that  the  leverage  of  the  oars  may  be  longer.  And  this  ship  should  be 
a  foot  and  a  half  in  thickness,  that  is  made  of  beams  fastened  inside 
and  outside  by  planks  set  crosswise. 

And  let  the  vessel  have  fastened  to  it  a  foot  below  the  water's  edge 
a  spike  shod  with  iron  of  the  weight  and  size  of  an  anvil.  And  by  the 
might  of  the  oars  this  vessel  will  be  able  to  draw  back  after  it  has 
struck  the  first  blow,  and  will  then  hurl  itself  forward  again  with 
fury  and  deal  the  second  blow  and  then  the  third,  and  so  many  others 
as  to  destroy  the  ship.  ms.  2037  Bib.  Nat.  3  r

You  should  do  this: — keep,  when  you  go  into  the  combat,  on  your 
feet,  underneath  your  shoes,  iron  soles,  divided  in  the  middle  as  is 
shown  in  the  drawing  above,  so  that  it  is  possible  to  bend  the  feet; 
and  the  underside  of  these  soles  should  have  the  form  of  a  rasping 
file,  or  be  filled  with  blunted  points  of  nails,  in  order  to  prevent  the 
soap  from  causing  the  foot  to  slip  and  so  making  the  man  fall  down 
flat;  and,  as  they  are  of  iron,  the  small  boards  and  caltrops  will  be 
thrown  in  vain.  ms.  2037  Bib.  Nat.  6  v. 

A  SCORPION 

[Figures] 

This  machine  is  so  constructed  that  the  scythe  springs  up  when  it  is 
discharged;  and  the  ships  which  carry  scythes  should  be  of  this  sort, 
namely  without  either  mast  or  sail  and  with  a  great  quantity  of  oars  so 
that  they  may  be  swift;  without  a  sail  because  the  sail,  mast  and  cord- 
age would  interfere  with  the  working  of  the  great  scythe.  The  machine 
is  called  a  scorpion  because  of  its  resemblance  to  one  and  because  of 
the  damage  it  inflicts  with  its  tail.  Mantelets  are  fixed  over  the  rowers 
in  order  that  the  masts,  that  is  to  say  the  mast-heads,  or  rather  the 
combatants  at  the  mast-heads,  may  not  be  able  to  do  them  any  injury; 
and  these  should  be  covered  with  moist  hides  because  of  the  fire 
thrown  by  the  enemy. 

A  way  of  protecting  against  it  is  for  ships  to  be  provided  with  chains 
of  rope  to  a  height  of  six  braccia. 

[Figure]  This  ship  is  to  serve  as  a  defence  against  cannon,  and  it 
attacks  the  other  ships  with  its  cannon;  it  is  covered  with  sheet  metal  'J 
as  a  protection  against  fire,  and  bristling  with  points  of  nails  so  that  the 
enemy  may  not  leap  upon  it  with  impunity,     ms.  2037  Bib.  Nat.  8  r.

Some  of  the  combatants  in  the  Tyrrhenian  Sea  employ  this  method : 
they  fasten  an  anchor  to  one  end  of  the  lateen  yard  and  a  rope  to  the 
other,  and  this  rope  at  the  bottom  end  is  attached  to  another  anchor. 
In  the  fight  they  hook  the  first  anchor  to  the  oars  of  the  enemy's  ship 
and  by  the  force  of  the  capstan  draw  it  to  the  side.

And  they  throw  soft  soap  and  tow,  dipped  in  melted  pitch  and  set 
alight,  on  the  side  to  which  the  anchor  was  first  made  fast,  so  that  in 
order  to  escape  from  this  fire  the  defenders  of  the  ship  have  to  flee  to 
the  opposite  side;  and  by  doing  so  they  rendered  assistance  to  their 
assailants,  for  the  galley  was  drawn  to  the  side  more  easily  because  of 
this  counterpoise.  ms.  2037  Bib.  Nat.  9  r.

I  have  found  in  the  history  of  the  Spaniards  how,  in  their  wars  with 
the  English,  Archimedes  the  Syracusan,  who  was  then  living  at  the 
court  of  Ecliderides,  King  of  the  Cirodastri,  ordered  that  for  maritime 
combats  the  ships  should  have  tall  masts,  and  on  the  tops  of  these  he 
placed  a  small  yard  forty  feet  in  length  and  a  third  of  a  foot  wide, 
having  at  one  end  of  it  a  small  anchor  and  at  the  other  a  counterpoise. 

To  the  anchor  was  attached  twelve  feet  of  chain,  and  to  the  chain  as 
much  rope  as  would  reach  from  the  chain  to  the  base  of  the  mast-top 
where  it  was  fixed  by  a  small  rope,  going  down  from  this  base  to  the 
base  of  the  mast  where  a  very  strong  capstan  was  placed,  and  there  the 
end  of  the  cord  was  fastened.  But  to  go  back  to  the  use  of  the  machine, 
I  say  that  below  this  anchor  there  was  a  fire  which  with  a  loud  roar 
threw  out  its  rays  and  a  shower  of  burning  pitch,  and  as  this  shower 
fell  upon  the  enemy's  mast-top  it  compelled  the  men  stationed  there  to 
abandon  their  post;  and  consequently  the  anchor  being  lowered  by 
means  of  the  capstan  touched  the  sides  of  the  mast-top,  and  thus  in- 
stantly cut  the  rope  placed  at  the  base  of  the  mast-top  to  support  the 
rope  which  went  from  the  anchor  to  the  capstan.  And  drawing  the

reproduced  in  the  sections  entitled  Music,  Personalia  and  Dated  Notes. 

2  This  is  one  of  those  enigmatic  notes  which  have  given  rise  to  conjecture.  It  un- 
doubtedly may  refer  to  naval  preparations,  which  were  being  taken  by  the  Genoese  as 
part  of  Ludovic  Sforza's  concerted  schemes  of  defence  against  the  assaults  with  which 
he  was  threatened.  As  he  knew  of  Leonardo's  study  of  marine  warfare  he  would  find 
him  a  very  suitable  agent  to  send  on  such  a  mission.  This  is  incontestable.  But  the 
fact  remains  that  this  sentence,  which  is  all  that  exists  to  connect  Leonardo  with  Genoa, 
is  a  comparatively  slight  foundation  for  the  structure  of  hypothesis  that  has  been  raised 
upon  it.

7/  you  \now  how  to  describe  and  write  down 
the  appearance  of  the  forms,  the  painter  can 
make  them  so  that  they  appear  enlivened  with 
lights  and  shadows  which  create  the  very  ex- 
pression  of  the  faces;  herein  you  cannot  attain 
with  the  pen  where  he  attains  with  the  brush! 

How   painting   surpasses   all  human  works  by   reason  of   the   subtle 
possibilities  which  it  contains: 

The  eye,  which  is  called  the  window  of  the  soul,  is  the  chief  means 
whereby  the  understanding  may  most  fully  and  abundantly  appreciate 
the  infinite  works  of  nature;  and  the  ear  is  the  second,  inasmuch  as  it 
acquires  its  importance  from  the  fact  that  it  hears  the  things  which  the 
eye  has  seen.  If  you  historians,  or  poets,  or  mathematicians  had  never 
seen  things  with  your  eyes  you  would  be  ill  able  to  describe  them  in 
your  writings.  And  if  you,  O  poet,  represent  a  story  by  depicting  it 
with  your  pen,  the  painter  with  his  brush  will  so  render  it  as  to  be 
more  easily  satisfying  and  less  tedious  to  understand.  If  you  call  paint- 
ing 'dumb  poetry',  then  the  painter  may  say  of  the  poet  that  his  art  is 
'blind  painting'.  Consider  then  which  is  the  more  grievous  affliction,  to 
be  blind  or  to  be  dumb!  Although  the  poet  has  as  wide  a  choice  of  sub- 
jects as  the  painter,  his  creations  fail  to  afford  as  much  satisfaction  to 
mankind  as  do  paintings,  for  while  poetry  attempts  to  represent  forms, 
actions  and  scenes  with  words,  the  painter  employs  the  exact  images  of 
these  forms  in  order  to  reproduce  them.  Consider,  then,  which  is  more 
fundamental  to  man,  the  name  of  man  or  his  image?  The  name 
changes  with  change  of  country;  the  form  is  unchanged  except  by 
death. 

And  if  the  poet  serves  the  understanding  by  way  of  the  ear,  the 
painter  does  so  by  the  eye,  which  is  the  nobler  sense.

COMPARISON   OF   THE  ARTS  S5^ 

I  will  only  cite  as  an  instance  ot  this  how  il  a  good  painter  represents 
the  fury  of  a  battle  and  a  pod  also  describes  one,  and  the  two  descrip- 
tions are  shown  together  to  the  public,  yon  will  soon  see  which  will 
draw  most  of  the  spectators,  and  where  there  will  be  most  discussion,  to 
which  most  praise  will  he  given  and  which  will  satisfy  the  more.  There 
is  no  doubt  that  the  painting,  which  is  by  far  the  more  useful  and 
beautiful,  will  give  the  greater  pleasure.  Inscribe  in  any  place  the  name 
of  God  and  set  opposite  to  it  His  image,  you  will  see  which  will  be  held 
in  greater  reverence! 

Since  painting  embraces  within  itself  all  the  forms  of  nature,  you 
have  omitted  nothing  except  the  names,  and  these  are  not  universal 
like  the  forms.  If  you  have  the  results  of  her  processes  we  have  the 
processes  of  her  results. 

Take  the  case  of  a  poet  describing  the  beauties  of  a  lady  to  her  lover 
and  that  of  a  painter  who  makes  a  portrait  of  her;  you  will  see  whither 
nature  will  the  more  incline  the  enamoured  judge.  Surely  the  proof  of 
the  matter  ought  to  rest  upon  the  verdict  of  experience! 

You  have  set  painting  among  the  mechanical  arts!  Truly  were 
painters  as  ready  equipped  as  you  are  to  praise  their  own  works  in 
writing,  I  doubt  whether  it  would  endure  the  reproach  of  so  vile  a 
name.  If  you  call  it  mechanical  because  it  is  by  manual  work  that  the 
hands  represent  what  the  imagination  creates,  your  writers  are  setting 
down  with  the  pen  by  manual  work  what  originates  in  the  mind.  If 
you  call  it  mechanical  because  it  is  done  for  money,  who  fall  into  this 
error — if  indeed  it  can  be  called  an  error — more  than  you  yourselves? 
If  you  lecture  for  the  Schools  do  you  not  go  to  whoever  pays  you  the 
most?  Do  you  do  any  work  without  some  reward? 

And  yet  I  do  not  say  this  in  order  to  censure  such  opinions,  for  every 
labour  looks  for  its  reward.  And  if  the  poet  should  say,  'I  will  create  a 
fiction  which  shall  express  great  things',  so  likewise  will  the  painter 
also,  for  even  so  Apelles  made  the  Calumny.  If  you  should  say  that 
poetry  is  the  more  enduring, — to  this  I  would  reply  that  the  works  of 
a  coppersmith  are  more  enduring  still,  since  time  preserves  them 
longer  than  either  your  works  or  ours;  nevertheless  they  show  but 
little  imagination;  and  painting,  if  it  be  done  upon  copper  in  enamel 
colours,  can  be  made  far  more  enduring. 

In  Art  we  may  be  said  to  be  grandsons  unto  God.  If  poetry  treats 


854  COMPARISON  OF  THE  ARTS 

of  moral  philosophy,  painting  has  to  do  with  natural  philosophy;  if 
the  one  describes  the  workings  of  the  mind,  the  other  considers  what 
the  mind  effects  by  movements  of  the  body;  if  the  one  dismays  folk 
by  hellish  fictions,  the  other  does  the  like  by  showing  the  same  things 
in  action.  Suppose  the  poet  sets  himself  to  represent  some  image  of 
beauty  or  terror,  something  vile  and  foul,  or  some  monstrous  thing,  in 
contest  with  the  painter,  and  suppose  in  his  own  way  he  makes  a 
change  of  forms  at  his  pleasure,  will  not  the  painter  still  satisfy  the 
more  ?  Have  we  not  seen  pictures  which  bear  so  close  a  resemblance  to 
the  actual  thing  that  they  have  deceived  both  men  and  beasts? 

If  you  know  how  to  describe  and  write  down  the  appearance  of  the 
forms,  the  painter  can  make  them  so  that  they  appear  enlivened  with 
lights  and  shadows  which  create  the  very  expression  of  the  faces; 
herein  you  cannot  attain  with  the  pen  where  he  attains  with  the 
brush.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  19  r.  and  v.,  20  r. 

How  he  who  despises  painting  has  no  love  for  the  philosophy  in 
nature  : 

If  you  despise  painting,  which  is  the  sole  imitator  of  all  the  visible 
works  of  nature,  it  is  certain  that  you  will  be  despising  a  subtle  inven- 
tion which  with  philosophical  and  ingenious  speculation  takes  as  its 
theme  all  the  various  kinds  of  forms,  airs  and  scenes,  plants,  animals, 
grasses  and  flowers,  which  are  surrounded  by  light  and  shade.  And 
this  truly  is  a  science  and  the  true-born  daughter  of  nature,  since  paint- 
ing is  the  offspring  of  nature.  But  in  order  to  speak  more  correctly  we 
may  call  it  the  grandchild  of  nature;  for  all  visible  things  derive  their 
existence  from  nature,  and  from  these  same  things  is  born  painting. 
So  therefore  we  may  justly  speak  of  it  as  the  grandchild  of  nature  and 
as  related  to  God  himself.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  20  r. 

That  sculpture  is  less  intellectual  than  painting,  and  lacks  many  of 
its  natural  parts: 

As  practising  myself  the  art  of  sculpture  no  less  than  that  of  paint- 
ing, and  doing  both  the  one  and  the  other  in  the  same  degree,  it  seems 
to  me  that  without  suspicion  of  unfairness  I  may  venture  to  give  an 
opinion  as  to  which  of  the  two  is  the  more  intellectual,  and  of  the 
greater  difficulty  and  perfection. 

In  the  first  place,  sculpture  is  dependent  on  certain  lights,  namely 


COMPARISON  OF  THE  ARTS  855 

those  from  above,  while  a  picture  carries  everywhere  with  it  its  own 
light  and  shade;  light  and  shade  therefore  are  essential  to  sculpture. 
Ill  this  respect,  the  sculptor  is  aided  by  the  nature  of  the  relief,  which 
produces  these  of  its  own  accord,  but  the  painter  artificially  creates 
them  by  his  art  in  places  where  nature  would  normally  do  the  like. 
The  sculptor  cannot  render  the  difference  in  the  varying  natures  of 
the  colours  of  objects;  painting  does  not  fail  to  do  so  in  any  particular. 
The  lines  of  perspective  of  sculptors  do  not  seem  in  any  way  true; 
those  of  painters  may  appear  to  extend  a  hundred  miles  beyond  the 
work  itself.  The  effects  of  aerial  perspective  are  outside  the  scope  of 
sculptors'  work;  they  can  neither  represent  transparent  bodies  nor 
luminous  bodies  nor  angles  of  reflection  nor  shining  bodies  such  as 
mirrors  and  like  things  of  glittering  surface,  nor  mists,  nor  dull 
weather,  nor  an  infinite  number  of  things  which  I  forbear  to  mention 
lest  they  should  prove  wearisome. 

The  one  advantage  which  sculpture  has  is  that  of  offering  greater 
resistance  to  time;  yet  painting  offers  a  like  resistance  if  it  is  done  upon 
thick  copper  covered  with  white  enamel  and  then  painted  upon  with 
enamel  colours  and  placed  in  a  fire  and  fused.  In  degree  of  permanence 
it  then  surpasses  even  sculpture. 

It  may  be  urged  that  if  a  mistake  is  made  it  is  not  easy  to  set  it 
right,  but  it  is  a  poor  line  of  argument  to  attempt  to  prove  that  the 
fact  of  a  mistake  being  irremediable  makes  the  work  more  noble.  I 
should  say  indeed  that  it  is  more  difficult  to  correct  the  mind  of  the 
master  who  makes  such  mistakes  than  the  work  which  he  has  spoiled. 

We  know  very  well  that  a  good  experienced  painter  will  not  make 
such  mistakes;  on  the  contrary,  following  sound  rules  he  will  proceed 
by  removing  so  little  at  a  time  that  his  work  will  progress  well.  The 
sculptor  also  if  he  is  working  in  clay  or  wax  can  either  take  away  from 
it  or  add  to  it,  and  when  the  model  is  completed  it  is  easy  to  cast  it  in 
bronze;  and  this  is  the  last  process  and  it  is  the  most  enduring  form 
of  sculpture,  since  that  which  is  only  in  marble  is  liable  to  be  destroyed, 
but  not  when  done  in  bronze. 

But  painting  done  upon  copper,  which  by  the  methods  in  use  in 
painting  may  be  either  taken  from  or  altered,  is  like  the  bronze,  for 
when  you  have  first  made  the  model  for  this  in  wax  it  can  still  be 
either  reduced  or  altered.  While  the  sculpture  in  bronze  is  imperish- 


856  COMPARISON  OF  THE  ARTS 

able  this  painting  upon  copper  and  enamelling  is  absolutely  eternal; 
and  while  bronze  remains  dark  and  rough,  this  is  full  of  an  infinite 
variety  of  varied  and  lovely  colours,  of  which  I  have  already  made 
mention.  But  if  you  would  have  me  speak  only  of  panel  painting  I  am 
content  to  give  an  opinion  between  it  and  sculpture  by  saying  that 
painting  is  more  beautiful,  more  imaginative,  and  richer  in  resource, 
while  sculpture  is  more  enduring,  but  excels  in  nothing  else. 

Sculpture  reveals  what  it  is  with  little  effort;  painting  seems  a  thing 
miraculous,  making  things  intangible  appear  tangible,  presenting  in 
relief  things  which  are  flat,  in  distance  things  near  at  hand. 

In  fact,  painting  is  adorned  with  infinite  possibilities  of  which 
sculpture  can  make  no  use.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  25  v.  and  24  v. 

One  of  the  chief  proofs  of  skill  of  the  painter  is  that  his  picture 
should  seem  in  relief,  and  this  is  not  the  case  with  the  sculptor,  for  in 
this  respect  he  is  aided  by  nature.  c.a.  305  r.  a 

[Of  poetry  and  painting] 

When  the  poet  ceases  to  represent  in  words  what  exists  in  nature,  he 
then  ceases  to  be  the  equal  of  the  painter;  for  if  the  poet,  leaving  such 
representation,  were  to  describe  the  polished  and  persuasive  words  of 
one  whom  he  wishes  to  represent  as  speaking,  he  would  be  becoming 
an  orator  and  be  no  more  a  poet  or  a  painter.  And  if  he  were  to  de- 
scribe the  heavens  he  makes  himself  an  astrologer,  and  a  philosopher 
or  theologian  when  speaking  of  the  things  of  nature  or  of  God.  But  if 
he  returns  to  the  representation  of  some  definite  thing  he  would  be- 
come the  equal  of  the  painter  if  he  could  satisfy  the  eye  with  words  as 
the  painter  does  with  brush  and  colour,  [for  with  these  he  creates] 
a  harmony  to  the  eye,  even  as  music  does  in  an  instant  to  the  ear.

[Painting  and  sculpture] 

Why  the  picture  seen  with  two  eyes  will  not  be  an  example  of  such 
relief  as  the  relief  seen  with  two  eyes;  this  is  because  the  picture  seen 
with  one  eye  will  place  itself  in  relief  like  the  actual  relief,  having 
the  same  qualities  of  light  and  shade.  Quaderni  in  8  r.

Precepts  of  the  Painter 

'Fainting  is  concerned  with  all  the  ten  attributes 
of  sight,  namely  darkness,  brightness,  substance 
and  colour,  form  and  place,  remoteness  and 
nearness,  movement  and  rest;  and  it  is  with 
these  attributes  that  this  my  small  boo\  will  be 
interwoven! 

Which  is  the  more  difficult:  light  and  shade  or  good  design? 

I  maintain  that  a  thing  which  is  confined  by  a  boundary  is  more 
difficult  than  one  which  is  free.  Shadows  have  their  boundaries  at  cer- 
tain stages,  and  when  one  is  ignorant  of  this  his  works  will  be  lacking 
in  that  relief  which  is  the  importance  and  the  soul  of  painting.  Design 
is  free,  in  so  much  as  if  you  see  an  infinite  number  of  faces  they  will  be 
all  different,  one  with  a  long  nose  and  one  with  a  short;  the  painter 
therefore  must  also  assume  this  liberty,  and  where  there  is  liberty 
there  is  no  rule.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  1  r. 

PAINTING 

The  mind  of  the  painter  should  be  like  a  mirror  which  always  takes 
the  colour  of  the  thing  that  it  reflects,  and  which  is  filled  by  as  many 
images  as  there  are  things  placed  before  it.  Knowing  therefore  that  you 
cannot  be  a  good  master  unless  you  have  a  universal  power  of  repre- 
senting by  your  art  all  the  varieties  of  the  forms  which  nature  pro- 
duces,— which  indeed  you  will  not  know  how  to  do  unless  you  see 
them  and  retain  them  in  your  mind, — look  to  it,  O  Painter,  that  when 
you  go  into  the  fields  you  give  your  attention  to  the  various  objects, 
and  look  carefully  in  turn  first  at  one  thing  and  then  at  another,  mak- 
ing a  bundle  of  different  things  selected  and  chosen  from  among 
those  of  less  value.  And  do  not  after  the  manner  of  some  painters  who 
when  tired  by  imaginative  work,  lay  aside  their  task  and  take  exercise 

857 


858  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

by  walking,  in  order  to  find  relaxation,  keeping,  however,  such  weari- 
ness of  mind  as  prevents  them  either  seeing  or  being  conscious  of 
different  objects;  so  that  often  when  meeting  friends  or  relatives,  and 
being  saluted  by  them,  although  they  may  see  and  hear  them  they 
know  them  no  more  than  if  they  had  met  only  so  much  air. 

ms.  2038   Bib.  Nat.  2  r. 

The  various  contrasts  of  the  different  degrees  of  shadows  and  lights 
often  cause  hesitation  and  confusion  to  the  painter  who  aspires  to  imi- 
tate and  reproduce  the  things  that  he  sees.  The  reason  is  that  if  you 
see  a  white  cloth  side  by  side  with  a  black  one,  it  is  certain  that  the 
part  of  this  white  cloth  which  is  next  to  the  black  will  seem  whiter  by 
far  than  the  part  that  is  next  to  something  whiter  than  itself,  and  the 
reason  of  this  is  proved  in  my  Perspective. 


OF  THE  NATURE  OF  THE  FOLDS  OF  DRAPERIES 

That  part  of  the  fold  which  is  farthest  from  the  ends  where  it  is  con- 
fined will  return  most  closely  to  its  original  form.  Everything  naturally 
desires  to  remain  in  its  own  state.  Drapery  being  of  uniform  density 
and  thickness  on  the  reverse  and  on  the  right  side,  desires  to  lie  flat; 
consequently,  whenever  any  folds  or  pleats  force  it  to  depart  from  this 
condition  of  flatness,  it  obeys  the  law  of  this  force  in  that  part  of  itself 
where  it  is  most  constrained,  and  the  part  farthest  away  from  such 
constraint  you  will  find  return  most  nearly  to  its  original  state,  that  is 
to  say,  lying  extended  and  full.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  4  r. 

The  body  of  the  atmosphere  is  full  of  an  infinite  number  of  the 
pyramids  composed  of  radiating  straight  lines  which  are  caused  by  the 
boundaries  of  the  surfaces  of  the  bodies  in  shadow  that  are  found  there, 
and  the  farther  they  are  away  from  the  object  which  produces  them 
the  more  their  angle  becomes  acute.  And  although  they  intersect  and 
interlace  in  their  passage,  nevertheless  they  do  not  become  confused 
with  each  other  but  proceed  with  divergent  course,  spreading  them- 
selves out  and  becoming  diffused  through  all  the  surrounding  air. 

And  they  are  of  equal  power  among  themselves,  all  equal  to  each, 
and  each  equal  to  all,  and  by  means  of  them  are  transmitted  the 
images  of  the  objects,  and  these  are  transmitted  all  in  all,  and  all  in 


PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER  859 

each  part:  and  each  pyramid  receives  of  itself  in  each  of  its  smallest 
parts  the  whole  form  of  the  object  which  produces  it. 

ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  6  v. 


PRECEPTS  OF  PAINTING 

Let  the  sketches  for  historical  subjects  be  rapid,  and  the  working  of 
the  limbs  not  too  much  finished.  Content  yourself  with  merely  giving 
the  positions  of  these  limbs,  which  you  will  then  be  able  at  your  leisure 
to  finish  as  you  please.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  8  v. 

Among  shadows  of  equal  strength  that  which  is  nearest  to  the  eye 
will  seem  of  less  density.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  9  v. 

All  colours  in  distant  shadows  are  indistinguishable  and  undis- 
cernible. 

In  the  distance  all  colours  are  indistinguishable  in  shadows,  because 
an  object  which  is  not  touched  by  the  principal  light  has  no  power  to 
transmit  its  image  through  the  more  luminous  atmosphere  to  the  eye, 
because  the  lesser  light  is  conquered  by  the  greater. 

For  example,  we  see  in  a  house  that  all  the  colours  on  the  surface  of 
the  walls  are  visible  instantly  and  clearly  when  the  windows  of  the 
house  are  open;  but,  if  we  go  out  of  the  house  and  look  through  the 
windows  at  a  little  distance  in  order  to  see  the  paintings  on  the  walls, 
we  shall  see  instead  of  them  a  uniform  darkness. 

The  painter  ought  first  to  exercise  his  hand  by  copying  drawings  by 
good  masters;  and  having  acquired  facility  in  this  under  the  advice  of 
his  instructor,  he  ought  to  set  himself  to  copy  good  reliefs,  following 
the  rules  given  below. 

OF  DRAWING  FROM  RELIEF 

He  who  draws  from  relief  ought  to  take  his  position  so  that  the  eye 
of  the  figure  he  is  drawing  is  on  a  level  with  his  own.  And  this  should 
be  done  whenever  a  head  has  to  be  drawn  from  nature,  because  gen- 
erally figures  or  people  whom  you  meet  in  the  streets  all  have  their 
eyes  at  the  same  level  as  yours,  and  if  you  make  them  higher  or  lower 
you  will  find  that  your  portrait  will  not  resemble  them. 


860  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

OF  THE  WAY  TO  DRAW  FIGURES  FOR  HISTORIES 

The  painter  ought  always  to  consider,  as  regards  the  wall  on  which 
he  intends  to  represent  a  story,  the  height  of  the  position  where  he 
intends  to  place  his  characters,  so  that  when  he  makes  studies  from 
nature  for  this  purpose  he  should  have  his  eye  as  much  below  the  thing 
that  he  is  drawing  as  the  said  thing  appears  in  the  picture  above  the 
eye  of  the  spectator:  otherwise  the  work  will  be  deserving  of  censure. 


WHY  A  PAINTING  CAN  NEVER  APPEAR  DETACHED  AS  DO 
NATURAL  THINGS 

Painters  oftentimes  despair  of  their  power  to  imitate  nature,  on  per- 
ceiving how  their  pictures  are  lacking  in  the  power  of  relief  and  vivid- 
ness which  objects  possess  when  seen  in  a  mirror,  though  as  they  allege 
they  have  colours  that  for  clearness  and  depth  far  surpass  the  quality 
of  the  lights  and  shadows  of  the  object  seen  in  the  mirror,  arraigning 
herein  not  reason  but  their  own  ignorance,  in  that  they  fail  to  recognise 
the  impossibility  of  a  painted  object  appearing  in  such  relief  as  to  be 
comparable  to  the  objects  in  the  mirror,  although  both  are  on  a  flat  sur- 
face unless  they  are  seen  by  a  single  eye.  And  the  reason  of  this  is  that 
when  two  eyes  see  one  thing  after  another,  as  in  the  case  of  a  b  seeing 
n  m,m  cannot  entirely  cover  n  because  the  base  of  the  visual  lines  is  so 
broad  as  to  cause  one  to  see  the  second  object  beyond  the  first.  If  how- 
ever you  close  one  eye  as  /,  the  object  /  will  cover  up  r,  because  the 
visual  line  starts  in  a  single  point  and  makes  its  base  in  the  first  object, 
with  the  consequence  that  the  second  being  of  equal  size  is  never  seen. 

ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  10  r. 

Every  bodily  form  as  far  as  concerns  the  function  of  the  eye  is 
divided  into  three  parts,  namely  substance,  shape  and  colour.  The 
image  of  its  substance  projects  itself  farther  from  its  source  than  its 
colour  or  its  shape;  the  colour  also  projects  itself  farther  than  the 
shape,  but  this  law  does  not  apply  to  luminous  bodies. 

The  above  proposition  is  clearly  shown  and  confirmed  by  experi- 
ence, for  if  you  see  a  man  near  at  hand  you  will  be  able  to  recognise 
the  character  of  the  substance  of  the  shape  and  even  of  the  colour,  but, 


PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER  861 

if  he  goes  sonic  distance  away  from  you,  you  will  no  longer  be  able 
to  recognise  who  he  is  because  his  shape  will  lack  character,  and  it  he- 
goes  still  farther  away  you  will  not  be  able  to  distinguish  his  colour 
but  he  will  merely  seem  a  dark  body,  and  farther  away  still  he  will 
seem  a  very  small  round  dark  body.  He  will  appear  round  because 
distance  diminishes  the  various  parts  so  much  as  to  leave  nothing 
visible  except  the  greater  mass.  The  reason  of  this  is  as  follows: — We 
know  very  well  that  all  the  images  of  objects  penetrate  to  the  impren- 
siva1  through  a  small  aperture  in  the  eye;  therefore  if  the  whole 
horizon  a  d  enters  through  a  similar  aperture  and  the  object  b  c  is  a 
very  small  part  of  this  horizon,  what  part  must  it  occupy  in  the  minute 
representation  of  so  great  a  hemisphere?  And  since  luminous  bodies 
have  more  power  in  darkness  than  any  others  it  is  necessary,  since  the 
aperture  of  the  sight  is  considerably  in  shadow,  as  is  the  nature  of  all 
holes,  that  the  images  of  distant  objects  intermingle  within  the  great 
light  of  the  sky,  or  if  it  should  be  that  they  remain  visible  they  appear 
dark  and  black,  as  every  small  body  must  when  seen  in  the  limpidity 
of  the  air.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  12  v. 

[Images  in  the  air] 

All  bodies  together  and  each  of  itself  fill  the  surrounding  air  with  an 
infinite  number  of  their  images  which  are  all  in  all  this  air,  and  all  in 
the  parts  of  it,  bearing  with  them  the  nature  of  the  body,  the  colour 
and  the  form  of  their  cause. 

Perspective  is  the  bridle  and  rudder  of  painting. 

ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  13  r. 

Shadows  which  you  see  with  difficulty,  and  whose  boundaries  you 
cannot  define — but  which  you  only  apprehend  and  reproduce  in  your 
work  with  some  hesitation  of  judgment — these  you  should  not  repre- 
sent as  finished  or  sharply  defined,  for  the  result  would  be  that  your 
work  would  seem  wooden. 

OF  REFLECTION 

Reflections  are  caused  by  bodies  of  a  bright  nature  and  of  a  smooth 
and  half-opaque  surface,  which  when  struck  by  the  light  drive  it  back 
again  to  the  first  object  like  the  rebound  of  a  ball.

OF  WHERE  THERE  CANNOT  BE  LUMINOUS   REFLECTION 

All  solid  bodies  have  their  surfaces  covered  by  various  degrees  of 
light  and  shadow.  The  lights  are  of  two  kinds:  the  one  is  called  orig- 
inal the  other  derived.  Original  I  call  that  which  proceeds  from  the 
flame  of  the  fire,  or  from  the  light  of  the  sun,  or  of  the  atmosphere. 
Derived  light  is  the  light  reflected.  But,  to  return  to  the  promised 
definition,  I  say  that  there  is  no  luminous  reflection  on  the  side  of  the 
body  which  is  turned  towards  objects  in  shadow  such  as  shaded  scenes, 
meadows  with  grasses  of  varying  height,  green  or  bare  woods — for 
these,  although  the  part  of  each  branch  turned  to  the  original  light  is 
imbued  with  the  attributes  of  this  light,  have  nevertheless  so  many 
shadows  cast  by  each  branch  separately,  and  so  many  shadows  cast  by 
one  branch  on  another,  that  in  the  whole  mass  there  results  such  a 
depth  of  shadow  that  the  light  is  as  nothing;  hence  objects  such  as 
these  cannot  throw  any  reflected  light  upon  bodies  opposite  to  them. 

ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  14  v. 


WHY  THE  REPRESENTING  OF  GROUPS  OF  FIGURES  ONE 
ABOVE  ANOTHER  IS  TO  BE  AVOIDED 

This  custom,  which  is  universally  adopted  by  painters  for  the  walls 
of  chapels,  is  by  right  strongly  to  be  censured,  seeing  that  they  repre- 
sent one  composition  at  one  level  with  its  landscape  and  buildings,  and 
then  mount  to  the  stage  above  it  and  make  another,  and  so  vary  the 
point  of  sight  from  that  of  the  first  painting,  and  then  make  a  third, 
and  a  fourth,  in  such  a  way  that  the  work  on  the  one  wall  shows  four 
points  of  sight,  which  is  extreme  folly  on  the  part  of  such  masters. 

Now  we  know  that  the  point  of  sight  is  opposite  the  eye  of  the 
spectator  of  the  composition,  and  if  you  were  to  ask  me  how  I  should 
represent  the  life  of  a  saint  when  it  is  divided  up  in  several  composi- 
tions on  the  same  wall,  to  this  I  reply  that  you  ought  to  set  the  fore- 
ground with  its  point  of  sight  on  a  level  with  the  eye  of  the  spectators 
of  the  composition,  and  at  this  same  plane  make  the  chief  episode  on 
a  large  scale,  and  then  by  diminishing  gradually  the  figures  and  build- 
ings upon  the  various  hills  and  plains,  you  should  represent  all  the 
incidents  of  the  story.  And  on  the  rest  of  the  wall  up  to  the  top  you 


PRECEPTS   OF  THE  PAINTER  863 

should  make  trees  large  as  compared  with  the  figures,  or  angels  if 
these  are  appropriate  to  the  story,  or  birds  or  clouds  or  similar  things; 
but  otherwise  do  not  put  yourself  to  the  trouble  for  the  whole  of  your 
work  will  be  wrong. 

Figures  in  relief  in  the  act  of  movement  will  in  their  standing 
position  seem  naturally  to  fall  forward.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  16  r. 

The  youth  ought  first  to  learn  perspective,  then  the  proportions  of 
everything,  then  he  should  learn  from  the  hand  of  a  good  master  in 
order  to  accustom  himself  to  good  limbs;  then  from  nature  in  order  to 
confirm  for  himself  the  reasons  for  what  he  has  learnt;  then  for  a  time 
he  should  study  the  works  of  different  masters;  then  make  it  a  habit 
to  practise  and  work  at  his  art. 

How  the  first  picture  was  nothing  but  a  line  which  surrounded  the 
shadow  of  a  man  made  by  the  sun  upon  a  wall. 

How  historical  pictures  ought  not  to  be  crowded  and  confused  by

the  different  nature  of  the  folds  in  each;  and  do  not  make  a  costume

OF  THE  THREE  KINDS  OF  PERSPECTIVE 

Perspectives  are  of  three  kinds.  The  first  has  to  do  with  the  causes 
of  the  diminution  or  as  it  is  called  the  diminishing  perspective  of 
objects  as  they  recede  from  the  eye.  The  second  the  manner  in  which 
colours  are  changed  as  they  recede  from  the  eye.  The  third  and  last 
consists  in  defining  in  what  way  objects  ought  to  be  less  carefully 
finished  as  they  are  farther  away.  And  the  names  are  these: 

Linear  Perspective 
Perspective  of  Colour 
Vanishing  Perspective. 

OF  THE  FEW  FOLDS  IN  DRAPERIES 

How  figures  when  dressed  in  a  cloak  ought  not  to  show  the  shape  to 
such  an  extent  that  the  cloak  seems  to  be  next  to  the  skin;  for  surely 
you  would  not  wish  that  the  cloak  should  be  next  to  the  skin,  since  you 
must  realise  that  between  the  cloak  and  the  skin  are  other  garments 
which  prevent  the  shape  of  the  limbs  from  being  visible  and  appearing 
through  the  cloak.  And  those  limbs  which  you  make  visible,  make 
thick  of  their  kind  so  that  there  may  seem  to  be  other  garments  there 
under  the  cloak.  And  you  should  only  allow  the  almost  identical  thick- 
ness of  the  limbs  to  be  visible  in  a  nymph  or  an  angel,  for  these  are 
represented  clad  in  light  draperies,  which  by  the  blowing  of  the  wind 
are  driven  and  pressed  against  the  various  limbs  of  the  figures.

OF  THE  WAY  TO  PRESENT  DISTANT  OBJECTS  IN  PAINTING 

It  is  evident  that  the  part  of  the  atmosphere  which  lies  nearest  the 
level  ground  is  denser  than  the  rest,  and  that  the  higher  it  rises  the 
lighter  and  more  transparent  it  becomes. 

In  the  case  of  large  and  lofty  objects  which  are  some  distance  away 
from  you,  their  lower  parts  will  not  be  much  seen,  because  the  line  by 
which  you  should  see  them  passes  through  the  thickest  and  densest 
portion  of  the  atmosphere.  But  the  summits  of  these  heights  are  seen 
along  a  line  which,  although  when  starting  from  your  eye  it  is  projected 
through  the  denser  atmosphere,  yet  since  it  ends  at  the  highest  summit 
of  the  object  seen,  concludes  its  course  in  an  atmosphere  far  more  rare- 
fied than  that  of  its  base.  And  consequently  the  farther  away  from  you 
this  line  extends  from  point  to  point  the  greater  is  the  change  in  the 
finer  quality  of  the  atmosphere. 

Do  you,  therefore,  O  painter,  when  you  represent  mountains,  see 
that  from  hill  to  hill  the  bases  are  always  paler  than  the  summits,  and 
the  farther  away  you  make  them  one  from  another  let  the  bases  be 
paler  in  proportion,  and  the  loftier  they  are  the  more  they  should  re^ 
veal  their  true  shape  and  colour.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  18  r. 

How  the  atmosphere  should  be  represented  as  paler  in  proportion  as 
you  show  it  extending  lower: 

Since  the  atmosphere  is  dense  near  the  ground,  and  the  higher  it  is 
the  finer  it  becomes,  therefore  when  the  sun  is  in  the  east  and  you  look 
towards  the  west,  taking  in  a  part  to  the  north  and  to  the  south,  you 
will  see  that  this  dense  air  receives  more  light  from  the  sun  than  the 
finer  air,  because  the  rays  encounter  more  resistance.  And  if  your  view 
of  the  horizon  is  bounded  by  a  low  plain,  that  farthest  region  of  the 
sky  will  be  seen  through  that  thicker  whiter  atmosphere,  and  this  will 
destroy  the  truth  of  the  colour  as  seen  through  such  a  medium;  and  the 
sky  will  seem  whiter  there  than  it  does  overhead,  where  the  line  of 
vision  traverses  a  lesser  space  of  atmosphere  charged  with  thick  va- 
pours. But  if  you  look  towards  the  east  the  atmosphere  will  appear 
darker  in  proportion  as  it  is  lower,  for  in  this  lower  atmosphere  the 
luminous  rays  pass  less  freely.

How  shadows  are  distributed  in  different  positions,  and  of  the  objects 
situated  in  them: 

If  the  sun  is  in  the  east  and  you  look  towards  the  west  you  will  see 
that  all  the  things  which  are  illuminated  are  entirely  deprived  of 
shadow,  because  what  you  are  looking  at  is  what  the  sun  sees. 

And  if  you  look  to  the  south  and  the  north  you  will  see  that  all  the 
bodies  are  surrounded  by  light  and  shade,  because  you  are  looking  both 
at  the  part  that  does  not  see  and  the  part  that  sees  the  sun.  And  if  you 
look  towards  the  pathway  of  the  sun  all  the  objects  will  present  their 
shaded  side  to  you  because  this  side  cannot  be  seen  by  the  sun. 


OF  THE  WAY  TO  REPRESENT  A  NIGHT  SCENE 

Whatever  is  entirely  deprived  of  light  is  all  darkness.  When  such  is 
the  condition  of  night,  if  you  wish  to  represent  a  scene  therein,  you 
must  arrange  to  introduce  a  great  fire  there,  and  then  the  things  which 
are  nearest  to  the  fire  will  be  more  deeply  tinged  with  its  colour,  for 
whatever  is  nearest  to  the  object  partakes  most  fully  of  its  nature;  and 
making  the  fire  of  a  reddish  colour  you  should  represent  all  the  things 
illuminated  by  it  as  being  also  of  a  ruddy  hue,  while  those  which  are 
farther  away  from  the  fire  should  be  dyed  more  deeply  with  the  black 
colour  of  the  night.  The  figures  which  are  between  you  and  the  fire 
will  appear  dark  against  the  brightness  of  the  flame,  for  that  part  of  the 
object  which  you  perceive  is  coloured  by  the  darkness  of  the  night,  and 
not  by  the  brightness  of  the  fire;  those  which  are  at  the  sides  should  be 
half  in  shadow  and  half  in  ruddy  light;  and  those  visible  beyond  the 
edge  of  the  flames  will  all  be  lit  up  with  ruddy  light  against  a  dark 
background.  As  for  their  actions,  show  those  who  are  near  it  making  a 
screen  with  hands  and  cloaks  as  a  protection  against  the  unbearable 
heat,  with  faces  turned  away  as  though  on  the  point  of  flight;  while  of 
those  farther  away  you  should  show  a  great  number  pressing  their 
hands  upon  their  eyes,  hurt  by  the  intolerable  glare.

Why  of  two  objects  of  equal  size  the  painted  one  will  look  larger

nevertheless  attempt  to  prove  it,  if  not  completely  then  in  part.  Dimin- 
ishing perspective  demonstrates  hy  reason  that  objects  diminish  in 
proportion  as  they  are  Luther  away  from  the  eye,  and  this  theory  is 
entirely  confirmed  by  experience.  Now  the  lines  of  sight  which  are  be- 
tween the  object  and  the  eye  are  all  intersected  at  a  uniform  boundary 
when  they  reach  the  surface  of  the  painting;  while  the  lines  which  pass 
from  the  eye  to  the  piece  of  sculpture  have  different  boundaries  and 
are  of  varying  lengths.  The  line  which  is  the  longest  extends  to  a  limb 
which  is  farther  away  than  the  rest,  and  consequently  this  limb  appears 
smaller;  and  there  are  many  lines  longer  than  others,  for  the  reason 
that  there  are  many  small  parts  one  farther  away  than  another,  and 
being  farther  away  these  of  necessity  appear  smaller,  and  by  appearing 
smaller  they  effect  a  corresponding  decrease  in  the  whole  mass  of  the 
object.  But  this  does  not  happen  in  the  painting,  because  as  the  lines 
of  sight  end  at  the  same  distance  it  follows  that  they  do  not  undergo 
diminution,  and  as  the  parts  are  not  themselves  diminished  they  do  not 
lessen  the  whole  mass  of  the  object,  and  consequently  the  diminution  is 
not  perceptible  in  the  painting  as  it  is  in  sculpture.

HOW  WHITE  BODIES  OUGHT  TO  BE  REPRESENTED 

When  you  are  representing  a  white  body  surrounded  by  ample  space, 
since  the  white  has  no  colour  in  itself  it  is  tinged  and  in  part  trans- 
formed by  the  colour  of  what  is  set  over  against  it.  If  you  are  looking  at 
a  woman  dressed  in  white  in  the  midst  of  a  landscape  the  side  of  her 
that  is  exposed  to  the  sun  will  be  so  dazzling  in  colour  that  parts  of  it, 
like  the  sun  itself,  will  cause  pain  to  the  sight,  and  as  for  the  side  ex- 
posed to  the  atmosphere — which  is  luminous  because  of  the  rays  of  the 
sun  being  interwoven  with  it  and  penetrating  it — since  this  atmosphere 
is  itself  blue,  the  side  of  the  woman  which  is  exposed  to  it  will  appear 
steeped  in  blue.  If  the  surface  of  the  ground  near  to  her  be  meadows, 
and  the  woman  be  placed  between  a  meadow  lit  by  the  sun  and  the  sun 
itself,  you  will  find  that  all  the  parts  of  the  folds  [of  her  dress]  which 
are  turned  towards  the  meadow  will  be  dyed  by  the  reflected  rays  to  the 
colour  of  the  meadow;  and  thus  she  becomes  changed  into  the  colours 
of  the  objects  near,  both  those  luminous  and  those  non-luminous.

OF  THE  CHOICE  OF  THE  LIGHT  WHICH  GIVES  A  GRACE 

TO  FACES 

If  you  have  a  courtyard  which,  when  you  so  please,  you  can  cover 
over  with  a  linen  awning,  the  light  will  then  be  excellent.  Or  when  you 
wish  to  paint  a  portrait,  paint  it  in  bad  weather,  at  the  fall  of  the  eve- 
ning, placing  the  sitter  with  his  back  to  one  of  the  walls  of  the  court- 
yard. Notice  in  the  streets  at  the  fall  of  the  evening  when  it  is  bad 
weather  the  faces  of  the  men  and  women — what  grace  and  softness 
they  display!  Therefore,  O  painter,  you  should  have  a  courtyard  fitted 
up  with  the  walls  tinted  in  black  and  with  the  roof  projecting  forward 
a  little  beyond  the  wall;  and  the  width  of  it  should  be  ten  braccia,  and 
the  length  twenty  braccia,  and  the  height  ten  braccia;  and  you  should 
cover  it  over  with  the  awning  when  the  sun  is  on  it,  or  else  you  should 
make  your  portrait  at  the  hour  of  the  fall  of  the  evening  when  it  is 
cloudy  or  misty,  for  the  light  then  is  perfect. 

WHY  FACES  AT  A  DISTANCE  APPEAR  DARK 

We  see  clearly  that  all  the  images  of  the  visible  things  both  large  and 
small  which  serve  us  as  objects  enter  to  the  sense  through  the  tiny  pu- 
pil of  the  eye.  If,  then,  through  so  small  an  entrance  there  passes  the 
image  of  the  immensity  of  the  sky  and  of  the  earth,  the  face  of  man — 
being  almost  nothing  amid  such  vast  images  of  things,  because  of  the 
distance  which  diminishes  it — occupies  so  little  of  the  pupil  as  to  re- 
main indistinguishable;  and  having  to  pass  from  the  outer  surface  to 


PRECEPTS   OF  THE   PAINTER  869 

the  scat  of  the  sense  through  a  dark  medium,  that  is,  through  the  hol- 
low cells  which  appear  dark,  this  image  when  not  of  a  strong  colour 
is  affected  by  the  darkness  through  which  it  passes,  and  on  reaching  the 
seat  of  the  sense  it  appears  dark.  No  other  reason  can  be  advanced  to 
account  for  the  blackness  of  this  point  in  the  pupil;  and  since  it  is  filled 
with  a  moisture  transparent  like  the  air,  it  acts  like  a  hole  made  in  a 
hoard;  and  when  looked  into  it  appears  black,  and  the  objects  seen  in 
the  air,  whether  light  or  dark,  become  indistinct  in  the  darkness. 


OF  SHADOWS  IN  THE  FAR  DISTANCE 

Shadows  become  lost  in  the  far  distance,  because  the  vast  expanse  of 
luminous  atmosphere  which  lies  between  the  eye  and  the  object  seen 
suffuses  the  shadows  of  the  object  with  its  own  colour. 


WHY  A  MAN  SEEN  AT  A  CERTAIN  DISTANCE  CANNOT 
BE  RECOGNISED 

Diminishing  perspective  shows  us  that  in  proportion  as  an  object  is 
farther  away  the  smaller  it  becomes.  And  if  you  look  at  a  man  who  is 
at  the  distance  of  a  bowshot  away  from  you  and  put  the  eye  of  a  small 
needle  close  to  your  eye,  you  will  be  able  through  this  to  see  the  images 
of  many  men  transmitted  to  the  eye,  and  these  will  all  be  contained  at 
one  and  the  same  time  within  the  eye  of  the  said  needle.  If  then  the 
image  of  a  man  who  is  distant  from  you  the  space  of  a  bowshot  is  so 
transmitted  to  your  eye  as  to  occupy  only  a  small  part  of  the  eye  of  a 
needle,  how  should  you  be  able  in  so  small  a  figure  to  distinguish  or 
discern  the  nose  or  mouth  or  any  detail  of  the  body? 

And  not  seeing  these  you  cannot  recognise  the  man,  since  he  does  not 
show  you  the  features  which  cause  men  to  differ  in  appearance. 

OF  ATTITUDES 

The  pit  of  the  throat  is  above  the  foot.  If  an  arm  be  thrown  forward 
the  pit  of  the  throat  moves  from  above  the  foot,  and  if  the  leg  is  thrown 
backwards  the  pit  of  the  throat  moves  forwards,  and  so  it  changes 
with  every  change  of  attitude.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  20  v.

HOW  TO    REPRESENT  A  TEMPEST 

If  you  wish  to  represent  a  tempest  properly,  consider  and  set  down 
exactly  what  are  the  results  when  the  wind  blowing  over  the  face  of  the 
sea  and  of  the  land  lifts  and  carries  with  it  everything  that  is  not  im- 
movable in  the  general  mass.  And  in  order  properly  to  represent  this 
tempest,  you  must  first  of  all  show  the  clouds,  riven  and  torn,  swept 
along  in  the  path  of  the  wind,  together  with  storms  of  sand  blown  up 
from  the  sea  shores,  and  branches  and  leaves  caught  up  by  the  irresisti- 
ble fury  of  the  gale  and  scattered  through  the  air,  and  with  them  many 
other  things  of  light  weight.  The  trees  and  shrubs  should  be  bent  to 
the  ground,  as  though  showing  their  desire  to  follow  the  direction  of 
the  wind,  with  their  branches  twisted  out  of  their  natural  growth  and 
their  leaves  tossed  and  inverted.  Of  the  men  who  are  there,  some 
should  have  fallen  and  be  lying  wrapped  round  by  their  garments  and 
almost  indistinguishable  on  account  of  the  dust,  and  those  who  are  left 
standing  should  be  behind  some  tree  with  their  arms  thrown  round  it 
to  prevent  the  wind  from  dragging  them  away;  others  should  be  shown 
crouching  on  the  ground,  their  hands  over  their  eyes  because  of  the 
dust,  their  garments  and  hair  streaming  in  the  wind.  Let  the  sea  be 
wild  and  tempestuous,  and  between  the  crests  of  its  waves  it  should  be 
covered  with  eddying  foam,  and  the  wind  should  carry  the  finer  spray 
through  the  stormy  air  after  the  manner  of  a  thick  and  all-enveloping 
mist. 

Of  the  ships  that  are  there,  some  you  should  show  with  sail  rent  and 
the  shreds  of  it  flapping  in  the  air  in  company  with  the  broken  hal- 
yards, and  some  of  the  masts  broken  and  gone  by  the  board,  and  the 
vessel  itself  lying  disabled  and  broken  by  the  fury  of  the  waves,  with 
some  of  the  crew  shrieking  and  clinging  to  the  fragments  of  the  wreck. 
You  should  show  the  clouds,  driven  by  the  impetuous  winds,  hurled 
against  the  high  mountain  tops,  and  there  wreathing  and  eddying  like 
waves  that  beat  upon  the  rocks;  the  very  air  should  strike  terror 
through  the  murky  darkness  occasioned  therein  by  the  dust  and  mist

When  you  desire  to  represent  anyone  speaking  among  a  group  of

and  how  so  to  order  his  actions  that  they  may  be  in  keeping  with  this 
subject.  That  is,  if  the  subject  be  persuasive,  the  actions  should  serve 
this  intention;  if  it  be  one  that  needs  to  be  expounded  under  various 
heads,  the  speaker  should  take  a  finger  of  his  left  hand  between  two 
fingers  of  his  right,  keeping  the  two  smaller  ones  closed,1  and  let  his 
face  be  animated  and  turned  towards  the  people,  with  mouth  slightly 
opened,  so  as  to  give  the  effect  of  speaking.  And  if  he  is  seated  let  him 
seem  to  be  in  the  act  of  raising  himself  more  upright,  with  his  head  for- 
ward. And  if  you  represent  him  standing,  make  him  leaning  forward  a 
little  with  head  and  shoulders  towards  the  populace,  whom  you  should 
show  silent  and  attentive,  and  all  watching  the  face  of  the  orator  with 
gestures  of  admiration.  Show  the  mouths  of  some  of  the  old  men  with 
the  corners  pulled  down  in  astonishment  at  what  they  hear,  drawing 
back  the  cheeks  in  many  furrows,  with  their  eyebrows  raised  where 
they  meet,  making  many  wrinkles  on  their  foreheads;  and  show  some 
sitting  with  the  fingers  of  their  hands  locked  together  and  clasping 
their  weary  knees,  and  others — decrepit  old  men — with  one  knee  crossed 
over  the  other,  and  one  hand  resting  upon  it  which  serves  as  a  cup  for 
the  other  elbow,  while  the  other  hand  supports  the  bearded  chin.

And  the  more  you  wish  the  arm  to  seem  detached  from  the  breast  the

OF  THE  SURROUNDING  OF  BODIES  WITH  VARIOUS  SHAPES

Take  care  that  the  shadows  cast  upon  the  surfaces  of  bodies  by  differ-

ceives the  shadow. 


OF  THE  ESSENTIAL  NATURE  OF  SHADOW 

Shadow  partakes  of  the  nature  of  universal  things  which  are  all  more 
powerful  at  their  beginning  and  grow  weaker  towards  the  end.  I 
refer  to  the  beginning  of  all  forms  and  qualities  visible  or  invisible, 
and  not  of  things  brought  from  small  beginnings  to  a  mighty  growth 
by  time,  as  a  great  oak  would  be  which  has  its  feeble  beginning  in  a 
tiny  acorn;  though  I  would  rather  say  the  oak  is  most  powerful  at  the 
spot  where  it  is  born  in  the  ground,  for  there  is  the  place  of  its  great- 
est growth.  Darkness,  therefore,  is  the  first  stage  of  shadow  and  light 
is  the  last.  See,  therefore,  O  painter,  that  you  make  your  shadow  dark- 
est near  to  its  cause  and  make  the  end  of  it  become  changed  into  light 
so  that  it  seems  to  have  no  end. 

How  the  shadows  cast  by  particular  lights  should  be  avoided  because 
their  ends  are  like  their  beginnings: 

The  shadows  cast  by  the  sun  or  other  particular  lights  do  not  impart 
grace  to  the  body  to  which  they  belong,  but  rather  leave  the  parts  sep- 
arated in  a  state  of  confusion  with  a  visible  boundarv  of  shadow  and

light.  And  the  shadows  have  the  same  strength  at  the  end  that  they 
had  at  the  beginning.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  21  v. 


WHAT  SHADOW  AND  LIGHT  ARE 

Shadow  is  the  absence  of  light;  it  is  simply  the  obstruction  caused  by 
opaque  bodies  opposed  to  luminous  rays.  Shadow  is  of  the  nature  of 
darkness,  light  is  of  the  nature  of  brightness.  The  one  hides  and  the 
other  reveals.  They  are  always  in  company  attached  to  the  bodies.  And 
shadow  is  more  powerful  than  light  for  it  impedes  and  altogether  de- 
prives objects  of  brightness,  whereas  brightness  can  never  altogether 

drive  away  shadow  from  bodies,  that  is  from  opaque  bodies. 

t 

What  difference  there  is  between  a  shadow  inseparable  from  a  body 
and  a  cast  shadow: 

An  inseparable  shadow  is  one  which  is  never  parted  from  the  illumi- 
nated bodies,  as  is  the  case  with  a  ball,  for  when  it  is  in  the  light  it 
always  has  one  of  its  sides  covered  by  shadow  and  this  shadow  never 
separates  from  it  through  any  change  in  the  position  of  the  ball.  A  cast 
shadow  may  or  may  not  be  produced  by  the  body  itself.  Let  us  suppose 
the  ball  to  be  at  a  distance  of  a  braccio  from  the  wall  and  the  light  to 
be  coming  from  the  opposite  side:  this  light  will  throw  just  as  broad  a 
shadow  upon  the  wall  as  upon  the  side  of  the  ball  that  faces  the  wall. 
Part  of  a  cast  shadow  will  not  be  visible  when  the  light  is  below  the 
ball,  for  its  shadow  will  then  pass  towards  the  sky  and  finding  there  no 
obstruction  in  its  course  will  become  lost.        ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  22  r. 


A  WAY  TO  STIMULATE  AND  AROUSE  THE  MIND  TO 
VARIOUS  INVENTIONS 

I  will  not  refrain  from  setting  among  these  precepts  a  new  device  for 
consideration  which,  although  it  may  appear  trivial  and  almost  ludi- 
crous, is  nevertheless  of  great  utility  in  arousing  the  mind  to  various 
inventions. 

And  this  is  that  if  you  look  at  any  walls  spotted  with  various  stains 
or  with  a  mixture  of  different  kinds  of  stones,  if  you  are  about  to  in- 
vent some  scene  you  will  be  able  to  see  in  it  a  resemblance  to  various

different  landscapes  adorned  with  mountains,  rivers,  rocks,  trees,  plains, 
wide  valleys  and  various  groups  of  hills.  You  will  also  be  able  to  see 
divers  combats  and  figures  in  quick  movement,  and  strange  expressions 
of  faces,  and  outlandish  costumes,  and  an  infinite  number  of  things 
which  you  can  then  reduce  into  separate  and  well-conceived  forms. 
With  such  walls  and  blends  of  different  stones  it  comes  about  as  it  does 
with  the  sound  of  bells,  in  whose  clanging  you  may  discover  every 
name  and  word  that  you  can  imagine. 

OF  THE   TEN  ATTRIBUTES   OF   SIGHT  WHICH   ALL  FIND 
EXPRESSION  IN  PAINTING 

Painting  is  concerned  •with  all  the  ten  attributes  of  sight,  namely 
darkness  and  brightness,  substance  and  colour,  form  and  place,  remote- 
ness and  nearness,  movement  and  rest;  and  it  is  with  these  attributes 
that  this  my  small  book  will  be  interwoven,  recalling  to  the  painter  by 
what  rules  and  in  what  way  he  ought  by  his  art  to  imitate  all  things 
that  are  the  work  of  nature  and  the  adornment  of  the  world. 


HOW  THE  PAINTER  OUGHT  TO  PRACTISE  HIMSELF  IN 
THE  PERSPECTIVE  OF  COLOURS 

As  a  means  of  practising  this  perspective  of  the  variation  and  loss  or 
diminution  of  the  proper  essence  of  colours,  take,  at  distances  a  hun- 
dred braccia  apart,  objects  standing  in  the  landscape,  such  as  trees, 
houses,  men  and  places,  and  in  front  of  the  first  tree  fix  a  piece  of  glass 
so  that  it  is  quite  steady,  and  then  let  your  eye  rest  upon  it  and  trace  out 
a  tree  upon  the  glass  above  the  outline  of  the  tree;  and  afterwards  re- 
move the  glass  so  far  to  one  side  that  the  actual  tree  seems  almost  to 
touch  the  one  that  you  have  drawn.  Then  colour  your  drawing  in  such 
a  way  that  the  two  are  alike  in  colour  and  form,  and  that  if  you  close 
one  eye  both  seem  painted  on  the  glass  and  the  same  distance  away. 
Then  proceed  in  the  same  way  with  a  second  and  a  third  tree  at  dis- 
tances of  a  hundred  braccia  from  each  other.  And  these  will  always 
serve  as  your  standards  and  teachers  when  you  are  at  work  on  pictures 
where  they  can  be  applied,  and  they  will  cause  the  work  to  be  success- 
ful in  its  distance.

But  I  find  it  is  a  rule  that  the  second  is  reduced  to  four-fifths  the 
size  of  the  first  when  it  is  twenty  braccia  distant  from  it. 

OF  UNDULATING  MOVEMENTS  AND  EQUIPOISE  IN  HUMAN 
FIGURES  AND  FIGURES  OF  ANIMALS 

Whenever  you  make  a  figure  of  a  man  or  of  some  graceful  animal 
remember  to  avoid  making  it  seem  wooden;  that  is  it  should  move 
with  counterpoise  and  balance  in  such  a  way  as  not  to  seem  a  block  of 
wood. 

Those  whom  you  wish  to  represent  as  strong  should  not  be  shown 
thus  except  in  their  manner  of  turning  their  heads  upon  their  shoul- 
ders, ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  22  v. 

OF  LINEAR  PERSPECTIVE 

Linear  perspective  has  to  do  with  the  function  of  the  lines  of  sight, 
proving  by  measurement  how  much  smaller  is  the  second  object  than 
the  first  and  the  third  than  the  second,  and  so  on  continually  until  the 
limit  of  things  seen.  I  find  by  experience  that  if  the  second  object  is  as 
far  distant  from  the  first  as  the  first  is  from  your  eye,  although  as  be- 
tween themselves  they  may  be  of  equal  size,  the  second  will  seem  half 
as  small  again  as  the  first;  and  if  the  third  object  is  equal  in  size  to 
the  second,  and  it  is  as  far  beyond  the  second  as  the  second  is  from  the 
first,1  it  will  appear  half  the  size  of  the  second;  and  thus  by  successive 
degrees  at  equal  distances  the  objects  will  be  continually  lessened  by 
half,  the  second  being  half  the  first — provided  that  the  intervening 
space  does  not  amount  to  as  much  as  twenty  braccia;  for  at  the  distance 
of  twenty  braccia  a  figure  resembling  yours  will  lose  four-fifths  of  its 
size,  and  at  a  distance  of  forty  braccia  it  will  lose  nine-tenths,  and  nine- 
teen-twentieths  at  sixty  braccia,  and  so  by  degrees  it  will  continue  to 
diminish,  when  the  plane  of  the  picture  is  twice  your  own  height  away 
from  you,  for  if  the  distance  only  equals  your  own  height  there  is  a 
great  difference  between  the  first  set  of  braccia  and  the  second.

OF  PLACING  A  FIGURE  IN  THE  FOREGROUND  IN  AN 
HISTORICAL  COMPOSITION 

You  should  make  the  figure  in  the  foreground  in  an  historical  com- 
position proportionately  less  than  life  size  according  to  the  number  of 
braccia  that  you  place  it  behind  the  front  line,  and  then  make  the  others 
in  proportion  to  the  first  by  the  rule  above. 

I  give  the  degrees  of  the  things  seen  by  the  eye  as  the  musician  does 
of  the  sounds  heard  by  the  ear: 

Although  the  things  seen  by  the  eye  seem  to  touch  as  they  recede  I 
will  nevertheless  found  my  rule  on  spaces  of  twenty  braccia,  as  the 
musician  has  done  with  sounds,  for  although  they  are  united  and  con- 
nected together  he  has  nevertheless  fixed  the  degrees  from  sound  to 
sound,  calling  these  first,  second,  third,  fourth  and  fifth,  and  so  from 
degree  to  degree  he  has  given  names  to  the  varieties  of  the  sound  of  the 
voice,  as  it  becomes  higher  or  lower. 

A  method  of  making  the  shadow  on  figures  correspond  to  their  light 
and  their  shape: 

When  you  make  a  figure  and  wish  to  see  whether  the  shadow  cor- 
responds to  the  light,  and  is  neither  redder  nor  yellower  than  is  the 
nature  of  the  essence  of  the  colour  which  you  wish  to  show  in  shadow, 
you  should  do  as  follows:  with  a  finger  make  a  shadow  upon  the  illu- 
minated part,  and  if  the  accidental  shadow  made  by  you  is  like  the 
natural  shadow  made  by  your  finger  upon  your  work,  it  will  be  well 
then  by  moving  the  finger  nearer  or  farther  off,  to  make  the  shadows 
darker  or  lighter,  comparing  them  constantly  with  your  own.

WHY  AN  OBJECT  WHEN  PLACED  CLOSE  TO  THE  EYE  WILL 
HAVE  ITS  EDGES  INDISTINCT 

All  those  objects  opposite  to  the  eye  which  are  too  near  to  it  will  have 
their  edges  difficult  to  discern,  as  happens  when  objects  are  near  to  the 
light  and  cast  a  large  and  indistinct  shadow,  even  so  this  does  when 
it  has  to  judge  of  objects  outside  it:  in  all  cases  of  linear  perspective  its 
action  is  similar  to  that  of  light.  The  reason  of  this  is  that  the  eye  has 


PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER  877 

one  principal  line  [of  vision  |  which  dilates  as  it  acquires  distance,  and 
embraces  with  exactness  of  perception  large  things  far  away  as  it  does 
small  things  close  at  hand.  The  eye  however  sends  out  a  multitude  of 
lines  on  either  side  of  this  principal  centre-line,  and  these  have  less 
power  to  discern  correctly  as  they  are  farther  from  the  centre  in  this 
radiation.  It  follows  therefore  when  an  object  is  placed  close  to  the  eye 
that  at  that  stage  of  nearness  to  the  principal  line  of  vision  this  is  not 
capable  of  distinguishing  the  edges  of  the  object,  and  so  these  edges 
must  needs  find  themselves  amid  the  lines  that  have  but  a  poor  power 
of  comprehension.  Their  part  in  the  functions  of  the  eye  is  like  that  of 
setters  at  the  chase,  who  start  the  prey  but  cannot  catch  it.  So  while 
they  cannot  themselves  apprehend  them  they  are  a  reason  why  the 
principal  line  of  vision  is  diverted  to  the  objects  touched  by  these  lines. 
It  follows  therefore  that  the  objects  which  have  their  edges  judged 
by  these  lines  are  indistinct.  ms.  2038  23  v. 

OF  THE  WAY  TO  LEARN  WELL  BY  HEART 

When  you  wish  to  know  anything  well  by  heart  which  you  have 
studied  follow  this  method : — When  you  have  drawn  the  same  thing  so 
many  times  that  it  seems  that  you  know  it  by  heart  try  to  do  it  without 
the  model;  but  have  a  tracing  made  of  the  model  upon  a  thin  piece  of 
smooth  glass  and  lay  this  upon  the  drawing  you  have  made  without 
the  model.  Note  well  where  the  tracing  and  your  drawing  do  not  tally, 
and  where  you  find  that  you  have  erred  bear  it  in  mind  in  order  not  to 
make  the  mistake  again.  Even  return  to  the  model  in  order  to  copy  the 
part  where  you  were  wrong  so  many  times  as  to  fix  it  in  your  mind; 
and  if  you  cannot  procure  smooth  glass  to  make  a  tracing  of  the  ob- 
ject take  a  piece  of  very  fine  parchment  well  oiled  and  then  dried,  and 
when  you  have  used  it  for  one  drawing  you  can  wipe  this  out  with  a 
sponge  and  do  a  second. 

OF  THE  WAY  TO  REPRESENT  A  SCENE  CORRECTLY 

Take  a  piece  of  glass  of  the  size  of  a  half  sheet  of  royal  folio  paper, 
and  fix  it  well  in  front  of  your  eyes,  that  is  between  your  eye  and  the 
object  that  you  wish  to  portray.  Then  move  away  until  your  eye  is  two-

thirds  of  a  braccio  away  from  the  piece  of  glass,  and  fasten  your  head 
by  means  of  an  instrument  in  such  a  way  as  to  prevent  any  movement 
of  it  whatsoever.  Then  close  or  cover  up  one  eye,  and  with  a  brush  or 
a  piece  of  red  chalk  finely  ground  mark  out  on  the  glass  what  is  visible 
beyond  it;  afterwards  copy  it  by  tracing  on  paper  from  the  glass,  then 
prick  it  out  upon  paper  of  a  better  quality  and  paint  it  if  you  so  desire, 
paying  careful  attention  to  the  aerial  perspective. 

A  WAY  OF  LEARNING  HOW  TO  PLACE  A  FIGURE  WELL 

If  you  wish  thoroughly  to  accustom  yourself  to  correct  and  good 
positions  for  your  figures,  fasten  a  frame  or  loom  divided  into  squares 
by  threads  between  your  eye  and  the  nude  figure  which  you  are  repre- 
senting, and  then  make  the  same  squares  upon  the  paper  where  you 
wish  to  draw  the  said  nude  but  very  faintly.  You  should  then  place  a 
pellet  of  wax  on  a  part  of  the  network  to  serve  as  a  mark  which  as  you 
look  at  your  model  should  always  cover  the  pit  of  the  throat,  or  if  he 
should  have  turned  his  back  make  it  cover  one  of  the  vertebrae  of  the 
neck.  And  these  threads  will  instruct  you  as  to  all  the  parts  of  the 
body  which  in  each  attitude  are  found  below  the  pit  of  the  throat,  be- 
low the  angles  of  the  shoulders,  below  the  breasts,  the  hips  and  the 
other  parts  of  the  body;  and  the  transverse  lines  of  the  network  will 
show  you  how  much  higher  the  figure  is  above  the  leg  on  which  it  is 
posed  than  above  the  other,  and  the  same  with  the  hips,  the  knees  and 
the  feet.  But  always  fix  the  net  by  a  perpendicular  line  and  then  see 
that  all  the  divisions  that  you  see  the  nude  take  in  the  network,  the 
nude  that  you  draw  takes  in  the  network  of  your  sketch.  The  squares 
you  draw  may  be  as  much  smaller  than  those  of  the  network  in  pro- 
portion as  you  wish  your  figure  to  be  less  than  life  size:  then  keep  in 
mind  in  the  figures  that  you  make,  the  rule  of  the  corresponding 
proportions  of  the  limbs  as  the  network  has  revealed  it  to  you,  and  this 
should  be  three  and  a  half  braccia  in  height  and  three  wide,  at  a  dis- 
tance of  seven  braccia  from  you  and  one  from  the  nude  figure.

HOW  THE  MIRROR  IS  THE  MASTER  OF  PAINTERS 

When  you  wish  to  see  whether  the  general  effect  of  your  picture 
corresponds  with  that  of  the  object  represented  after  nature,  take  a 
mirror  and  set  it  so  that  it  reflects  the  actual  thing,  and  then  compare 
the  reflection  with  your  picture,  and  consider  carefully  whether  the  sub- 
ject of  the  two  images  is  in  conformity  with  both,  studying  especially 
the  mirror.  The  mirror  ought  to  be  taken  as  a  guide — that  is,  the  flat 
mirror — for  within  its  surface  substances  have  many  points  of  resem- 
blance to  a  picture;  namely,  that  you  see  the  picture  made  upon  one 
plane  showing  things  which  appear  in  relief,  and  the  mirror  upon  one 
plane  does  the  same.  The  picture  is  one  single  surface,  and  the  mirror 
is  the  same. 

The  picture  is  intangible,  inasmuch  as  what  appears  round  and  de- 
tached cannot  be  enclosed  within  the  hands,  and  the  mirror  is  the 
same.  The  mirror  and  the  picture  present  the  images  of  things  sur- 
rounded by  shadow  and  light,  and  each  alike  seems  to  project  con- 
siderably from  the  plane  of  its  surface.  And  since  you  know  that  the 
mirror  presents  detached  things  to  you  by  means  of  outlines  and 
shadows  and  lights,  and  since  you  have  moreover  amongst  your  colours 
more  powerful  shadows  and  lights  than  those  of  the  mirror,  it  is  certain 
that  if  you  but  know  well  how  to  compose  your  picture  it  will  also 
seem  a  natural  thing  seen  in  a  great  mirror,  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  24  v. 

Of  the  poor  excuse  made  by  those  who  falsely  and  unworthily  get 
themselves  styled  painters : 

There  is  a  certain  class  of  painters  who  though  they  have  given  but 
little  attention  to  study  claim  to  live  in  all  the  beauty  of  gold  and  azure. 
These  aver — such  is  their  folly! — that  they  are  not  able  to  work  up  to 
their  best  standard  because  of  the  poor  payment,  but  that  they  have 
the  knowledge  and  could  do  as  well  as  any  other  if  they  were  well 
paid. 

But  see  now  the  foolish  folk!  They  have  not  the  sense  to  keep  by 
them  some  specimen  of  their  good  work  so  that  they  may  say,  'this  is 
at  a  high  price,  and  that  is  at  a  moderate  price  and  that  is  quite  cheap', 
and  so  show  that  they  have  work  at  all  prices.

OF  AERIAL  PERSPECTIVE 

There  is  another  kind  of  perspective  which  I  call  aerial,  because  by 
the  difference  in  the  atmosphere  one  is  able  to  distinguish  the  various 
distances  of  different  buildings  when  their  bases  appear  to  end  on  a 
single  line,  for  this  would  be  the  appearance  presented  by  a  group  of 
buildings  on  the  far  side  of  a  wall,  all  of  which  as  seen  above  the  top 
of  the  wall  look  to  be  the  same  size;  and  if  in  painting  you  wish  to 
make  one  seem  farther  away  than  another  you  must  make  the  at- 
mosphere somewhat  heavy.  You  know  that  in  an  atmosphere  of  uni- 
form density  the  most  distant  things  seen  through  it,  such  as  the 
mountains,  in  consequence  of  the  great  quantity  of  atmosphere  which 
is  between  your  eye  and  them,  will  appear  blue,  almost  of  the  same 
colour  as  the  atmosphere  when  the  sun  is  in  the  east.  Therefore  you 
should  make  the  building  which  is  nearest  above  the  wall  of  its  natural 
colour,  and  that  which  is  more  distant  make  less  defined  and  bluer; 
and  one  which  you  wish  should  seem  as  far  away  again  make  of 
double  the  depth  of  blue,  and  one  you  desire  should  seem  five  times 
as  far  away  make  five  times  as  blue.  And  as  a  consequence  of  this  rule 
it  will  come  about  that  the  buildings  which  above  a  given  line  appear 
to  be  of  the  same  size  will  be  plainly  distinguished  as  to  which  are  the 
more  distant  and  which  larger  than  the  others. 

HOW  THE  PAINTER  IS  NOT  WORTHY  OF  PRAISE  UNLESS 
HE  IS  UNIVERSAL 

We  may  frankly  admit  that  certain  people  deceive  themselves  who 
apply  the  title  'a  good  master'  to  a  painter  who  can  only  do  the  head  or 
the  figure  well.  Surely  it  is  no  great  achievement  if  by  studying  one 
thing  only  during  his  whole  lifetime  he  attain  to  some  degree  of  ex- 
cellence therein!  But  since,  as  we  know,  painting  embraces  and  con- 
tains within  itself  all  the  things  which  nature  produces  or  which  result 
from  the  fortuitous  actions  of  men,  and  in  short  whatever  can  be  com- 
prehended by  the  eyes,  it  would  seem  to  me  that  he  is  but  a  poor 
master  who  makes  only  a  single  figure  well. 

For  do  you  not  see  how  many  and  how  varied  are  the  actions  which 
are  performed  by  men  alone?  Do  you  not  see  how  many  different 


PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER  881 

kinds  of  animals  there  are,  and  also  of  trees  and  plants  and  flowers? 
What  variety  of  hilly  and  level  places,  of  springs,  rivers,  cities,  public 
and  private  buildings;  of  instruments  fitted  for  man's  use;  of  divers 
costumes,  ornaments  and  arts? — Things  which  should  be  rendered 
with  equal  facility  and  grace  by  whoever  you  wish  to  call  a  good 
painter.

OF  STUDYING  AS   SOON  AS  YOU  ARE  AWAKE  OR   BEFORE

to  be  commended,  and  it  is  useful  in  fixing  things  in  the  memory. 

How  the  painter  ought  to  be  desirous  of  hearing  every  man's 
opinion  as  to  the  progress  of  his  work: 

Surely  when  a  man  is  painting  a  picture  he  ought  not  to  refuse  to 
hear  any  man's  opinion,  for  we  know  very  well  that  though  a  man 
may  not  be  a  painter  he  may  have  a  true  conception  of  the  form  of 
another  man,  and  can  judge  aright  whether  he  is  hump-backed  or  has 
one  shoulder  high  or  low,  or  whether  he  has  a  large  mouth  or  nose 
or  other  defects. 

Since  then  we  recognise  that  men  are  able  to  form  a  true  judgment 
as  to  the  works  of  nature,  how  much  the  more  does  it  behove  us  to 
admit  that  they  are  able  to  judge  our  faults.  For  you  know  how  much 
a  man  is  deceived  in  his  own  works,  and  if  you  do  not  recognise  this 
in  your  own  case  observe  it  in  others  and  then  you  will  profit  by  their 
mistakes.  Therefore  you  should  be  desirous  of  hearing  patiently  the 
opinions  of  others,  and  consider  and  reflect  carefully  whether  or  no  he 
who  censures  you  has  reason  for  his  censure;  and  correct  your  work 


882  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

if  you  find  that  he  is  right,  but  if  not,  then  let  it  seem  that  you  have 
not  understood  him,  or,  in  case  he  is  a  man  whom  you  esteem,  show 
him  by  argument  why  it  is  that  he  is  mistaken. 

How  in  works  of  importance  a  man  should  not  trust  so  entirely  to 
his  memory  as  to  disdain  to  draw  from  nature: 

Any  master  who  let  it  be  understood  that  he  could  himself  recall  all 
the  forms  and  effects  of  nature  would  certainly  appear  to  me  to  be 
endowed  with  great  ignorance,  considering  that  these  effects  are  in- 
finite and  that  our  memory  is  not  of  so  great  capacity  as  to  suffice 
thereto. 

Do  you  therefore,  O  painter,  take  care  lest  the  greed  for  gain  prove 
a  stronger  incentive  than  renown  in  art,  for  to  gain  this  renown  is  a 
far  greater  thing  than  is  the  renown  of  riches. 

For  these,  then,  and  other  reasons  which  might  be  given,  you  should 
apply  yourself  first  of  all  to  drawing,  in  order  to  present  to  the  eye  in 
visible  form  the  purpose  and  invention  created  originally  in  your 
imagination;  then  proceed  to  take  from  it  or  add  to  it  until  you  satisfy 
yourself;  then  have  men  arranged  as  models  draped  or  nude  in  the  way 
in  which  you  have  disposed  them  in  your  work;  and  make  the  pro- 
portions and  size  in  accordance  with  perspective,  so  that  no  part  of  the 
work  remains  that  is  not  so  counselled  by  reason  and  by  the  effects  in 
nature. 

And  this  will  be  the  way  to  make  yourself  renowned  in  your  art. 

An  object  which  is  represented  in  white  and  black  will  appear  in 
more  pronounced  relief  than  any  other :  and  therefore  I  would  remind 
you,  O  painter,  that  you  should  clothe  your  figures  in  as  bright  colours 
as  you  can,  for  if  you  make  them  dark  in  colour  they  will  be  only  in 
slight  relief  and  be  very  little  visible  at  a  distance.  This  is  because  the 
shadows  of  all  objects  are  dark,  and  if  you  make  a  garment  dark  there 
will  be  only  a  slight  difference  between  its  lights  and  shades,  whereas 
with  the  bright  colours  there  are  many  grades  of  difference.

OF  THE  WAY  TO  FIX  IN  YOUR  MIND  THE  FORM  OF  A  FACE 

If  you  desire  to  acquire  facility  in  keeping  in  your  mind  the  ex- 
pression of  a  face,  first  learn  by  heart  the  various  different  kinds  of 


PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER  883 

heads,  eyes,  noses,  mouths,  chins,  throats,  and  also  necks  and  shoulders. 
Take  as  an  instance  noses:— they  are  of  ten  types:  straight,  bulbous, 
hollow,  prominent  either  above  or  below  the  centre,  aquiline,  regular, 
simian,  round,  and  pointed.  These  divisions  hold  good  as  regards  pro- 
file. Seen  from  in  front,  noses  are  of  twelve  types:  thick  in  the  middle, 
thin  in  the  middle,  with  the  tip  broad,  and  narrow  at  the  base,  and 
narrow  at  the  tip,  and  broad  at  the  base,  with  nostrils  broad  or  nar- 
row, or  high  or  low,  and  with  the  openings  either  visible  or  hidden  by 
the  tip.  And  similarly  you  will  find  variety  in  the  other  features;  of 
which  things  you  ought  to  make  studies  from  nature  and  so  fix  them 
in  your  mind.  Or  when  you  have  to  draw  a  face  from  memory,  carry 
with  you  a  small  notebook  in  which  you  have  noted  down  such  fea- 
tures, and  then  when  you  have  cast  a  glance  at  the  face  of  the  person 
whom  you  wish  to  draw  you  can  look  privately  and  see  which  nose  or 
mouth  has  a  resemblance  to  it,  and  make  a  tiny  mark  against  it  in 
order  to  recognise  it  again  at  home.  Of  abnormal  faces  I  here  say 
nothing,  for  they  are  kept  in  mind  without  difficulty. 

OF  THE  GAMES   IN  WHICH   DRAUGHTSMEN   SHOULD 

INDULGE 

When  you,  draughtsmen,  wish  to  find  some  profitable  recreation  in 
games  you  should  always  practise  things  which  may  be  of  use  in  your 
profession,  that  is  by  giving  your  eye  accuracy  of  judgment  so  that  it 
may  know  how  to  estimate  the  truth  as  to  the  length  and  breadth  of 
objects.  So  in  order  to  accustom  the  mind  to  such  things  let  one  of  you 
draw  a  straight  line  anywhere  on  a  wall;  and  then  let  each  of  you  take 
a  light  rush  or  straw  in  his  hand,  and  let  each  cut  his  own  to  the  length 
which  the  first  line  appears  to  him  when  he  is  distant  from  it  a  space 
of  ten  braccia,  and  then  let  each  go  up  to  the  copy  in  order  to  measure 
it  against  the  length  which  he  has  judged  it  to  be,  and  he  whose 
measure  comes  nearest  to  the  length  of  the  copy  has  done  best  and  is 
the  winner,  and  he  should  receive  from  all  the  prize  which  was  pre- 
viously agreed  upon  by  you.  Furthermore  you  should  take  measure- 
ments fore-shortened,  that  is,  you  should  take  a  spear  or  some  other 
stick  and  look  before  you  to  a  certain  point  of  distance,  and  then  let 
each  set  himself  to  reckon  how  many  times  this  measure  is  contained 


884  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

in  the  said  distance.  Another  thing  is  to  see  who  can  draw  the  best 
line  one  braccio  in  length,  and  this  may  be  tested  by  tighdy  drawn 
thread. 

Diversions  such  as  these  enable  the  eye  to  acquire  accuracy  of  judg- 
ment, and  this  is  the  primary  essential  of  painting. 

WHETHER  IT  IS  BETTER  TO  DRAW  IN  COMPANY  OR  NO 

I  say  and  am  prepared  to  prove  that  it  is  much  better  to  be  in  the 
company  of  others  when  you  draw  rather  than  alone,  for  many  reasons. 
The  first  is  that  you  will  be  ashamed  of  being  seen  in  the  ranks  of  the 
draughtsmen  if  you  are  outclassed  by  them,  and  this  feeling  of  shame 
will  cause  you  to  make  progress  in  study;  secondly  a  rather  commend- 
able envy  will  stimulate  you  to  join  the  number  of  those  who  are  more 
praised  than  you  are,  for  the  praises  of  the  others  will  serve  you  as  a 
spur;  yet  another  is  that  you  will  acquire  something  of  the  manner  of 
anyone  whose  work  is  better  than  yours,  while  if  you  are  better  than 
the  others  you  will  profit  by  seeing  how  to  avoid  their  errors,  and  the 
praises  of  others  will  tend  to  increase  your  powers.

OF  THE  PROPER  TIME  FOR  STUDYING  THE  SELECTION 

OF  SUBJECTS 

The  winter  evenings  should  be  spent  by  youthful  students  in  study 
of  the  things  prepared  during  the  summer;  that  is,  all  the  drawings 
from  the  nude  which  you  have  made  in  the  summer  should  be  brought 
together,  and  you  should  make  a  choice  from  among  them  of  the  best 
limbs  and  bodies,  and  practise  at  these  and  learn  them  by  heart. 

OF  ATTITUDES 

Afterwards  in  the  ensuing  summer  you  should  make  choice  of  some 
one  who  has  a  good  presence,  and  has  not  been  brought  up  to  wear 
doublets,  and  whose  figure  consequently  has  not  lost  its  natural  bear- 
ing, and  make  him  go  through  various  graceful  and  elegant  move- 
ments. If  he  fails  to  show  the  muscles  very  clearly  within  the  outlines 


PRECEPTS   OF  THE   PAINTER  885 

of  the  limbs,  this  is  of  no  consequence.  It  is  enough  for  you  merely  to 
obtain  good  attitudes  from  the  figure,  and  you  can  correct  the  limbs  by 
those  which  you  have  studied  during  the  winter. 

HOW  IT  IS  NECESSARY  FOR  THE  PAINTER  TO  KNOW  THE 
INNER  STRUCTURE  OF  MAN 

The  painter  who  has  acquired  a  knowledge  of  the  nature  of  the 
sinews,  muscles,  and  tendons  will  know  exactly  in  the  movement  of 
any  limb  how  many  and  which  of  the  sinews  are  the  cause  of  it,  and 
which  muscle  by  its  swelling  is  the  cause  of  this  sinew's  contracting, 
and  which  sinews  having  been  changed  into  most  delicate  cartilage 
surround  and  contain  the  said  muscle.  So  he  will  be  able  in  divers 
ways  and  universally  to  indicate  the  various  muscles  by  means  of  the 
different  attitudes  of  his  figures;  and  he  will  not  do  like  many  who  in 
different  actions  always  make  the  same  things  appear  in  the  arm,  the 
back,  the  breast,  and  the  legs;  for  such  things  as  these  ought  not  to 
rank  in  the  category  of  minor  faults. 

OF  THE  CHOICE  OF  BEAUTIFUL  FACES 

Methinks  it  is  no  small  grace  in  a  painter  to  be  able  to  give  a  pleas- 
ing air  to  his  figures,  and  whoever  is  not  naturally  possessed  of  this 
grace  may  acquire  it  by  study,  as  opportunity  offers,  in  the  following 
manner.  Be  on  the  watch  to  take  the  best  parts  of  many  beautiful 
faces  of  which  the  beauty  is  established  rather  by  general  repute  than 
by  your  own  judgment,  for  you  may  readily  deceive  yourself  by  select- 
ing such  faces  as  bear  a  resemblance  to  your  own,  since  it  would  often 
seem  that  such  similarities  please  us;  and  if  you  were  ugly  you  would 
not  select  beautiful  faces,  but  would  be  creating  ugly  faces  like  many 
painters  whose  types  often  resemble  their  master;  so  therefore  choose 
the  beautiful  ones  as  I  have  said,  and  fix  them  in  your  mind. 

ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  27  r. 

OF  THE  LIFE  OF  THE  PAINTER  IN  HIS  STUDIO 

The  painter  or  draughtsman  ought  to  be  solitary,  in  order  that  the 
well-being  of  the  body  may  not  sap  the  vigour  of  the  mind;  and  more 


886  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

especially  when  he  is  occupied  with  the  consideration  and  investiga- 
tion of  things  which  by  being  continually  present  before  his  eyes  fur- 
nish food  to  be  treasured  up  in  the  memory. 

If  you  are  alone  you  belong  entirely  to  yourself;  if  you  are  accom- 
panied even  by  one  companion  you  belong  only  half  to  yourself,  or 
even  less  in  proportion  to  the  thoughtlessness  of  his  conduct;  and  if 
you  have  more  than  one  companion  you  will  fall  more  deeply  into  the 
same  plight. 

If  you  should  say,  'I  will  take  my  own  course;  I  will  retire  apart,  so 
that  I  may  be  the  better  able  to  investigate  the  forms  of  natural  ob- 
jects', then  I  say  this  must  needs  turn  out  badly,  for  you  will  not  be 
able  to  prevent  yourself  from  often  lending  an  ear  to  their  chatter; 
and  not  being  able  to  serve  two  masters  you  will  discharge  badly  the 
duty  of  companionship,  and  even  worse  that  of  endeavouring  to  real- 
ise your  conceptions  in  art. 

But  suppose  you  say,  'I  will  withdraw  so  far  apart  that  their  words 
shall  not  reach  me  nor  in  any  way  disturb  me'.  I  reply  that  in  this  case 
you  will  be  looked  upon  as  mad,  and  bear  in  mind  that  in  so  doing  you 
will  then  be  solitary. 

If  you  must  have  companionship  choose  it  from  your  studio;  it  may 
then  help  you  to  obtain  the  advantages  which  result  from  different 
methods  of  study.  All  other  companionship  may  prove  extremely 
harmful.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  27  v.  and  r. 

Of  the  method  of  learning  aright  how  to  compose  groups  of  figures 
in  historical  pictures: 

When  you  have  thoroughly  learnt  perspective,  and  have  fixed  in 
your  memory  all  the  various  parts  and  forms  of  things,  you  should 
often  amuse  yourself  when  you  take  a  walk  for  recreation,  in  watching 
and  taking  note  of  the  attitudes  and  actions  of  men  as  they  talk  and 
dispute,  or  laugh  or  come  to  blows  one  with  another,  both  their  actions 
and  those  of  the  bystanders  who  either  intervene  or  stand  looking  on 
at  these  things;  noting  these  down  with  rapid  strokes  in  this  way,1  in  a 
little  pocket-book,  which  you  ought  always  to  carry  with  you.  And  let 
this  be  of  tinted  paper,  so  that  it  may  not  be  rubbed  out;  but  you 
should  change  the  old  for  a  new  one,  for  these  are  not  things  to  be 

1  Sketch  of  figure  in  text  of  MS. 


PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER  887 

rubbed  out  but  preserved  with  the  utmost  diligence;  for  there  is  such 
an  infinite  number  of  forms  and  actions  of  things  that  the  memory  is 
incapable  of  preserving  them,  and  therefore  you  should  keep  those 
[sketches]  as  your  patterns  and  teachers. 


HOW   ONE   OUGHT  FIRST   TO  LEARN   DILIGENCE   RATHER 
THAN  RAPID  EXECUTION 

If  as  draughtsman  you  wish  to  study  well  and  profitably,  accustom 
yourself  when  you  are  drawing  to  work  slowly,  and  to  determine  be- 
tween the  various  lights,  which  possess  the  highest  degree  and  meas- 
ure of  brightness,  and  similarly  as  to  the  shadows,  which  are  those 
that  are  darker  than  the  rest,  and  in  what  manner  they  mingle  to- 
gether, and  to  compare  their  dimensions  one  with  another;  and  so 
with  the  contours  to  observe  which  way  they  are  tending,  and  as  to 
the  lines  what  part  of  each  is  curved  in  one  way  or  another,  and  where 
they  are  more  or  less  conspicuous  and  consequently  thick  or  fine;  and 
lastly  to  see  that  your  shadows  and  lights  may  blend  without  strokes 
or  lines  in  the  manner  of  smoke.  And  when  you  shall  have  trained 
your  hand  and  judgment  with  this  degree  of  care  it  will  speedily  come 
to  pass  that  you  will  have  no  need  to  take  thought  thereto. 

ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  27  v. 


OF  JUDGING  YOUR  OWN  PICTURE 

We  know  well  that  mistakes  are  more  easily  detected  in  the  works  of 
others  than  in  one's  own,  and  that  oftentimes  while  censuring  the 
small  faults  of  others  you  will  overlook  your  own  great  faults.  In 
order  to  avoid  such  ignorance  make  yourself  first  of  all  a  master  of 
perspective,  then  gain  a  complete  knowledge  of  the  proportions  of 
man  and  other  animals,  and  also  make  yourself  a  good  architect,  that 
is  in  so  far  as  concerns  the  form  of  the  buildings  and  of  the  other 
things  which  are  upon  the  earth,  which  are  infinite  in  form;  and  the 
more  knowledge  you  have  of  these  the  more  will  your  work  be  worthy 
of  praise;  and  for  those  things  in  which  you  have  no  practice  do  not 
disdain  to  draw  from  nature.  But  to  return  to  what  has  been  promised 
above,  I  say  that  when  you  are  painting  you  should  take  a  flat  mirror 


888  PRECEPTS   OF  THE  PAINTER 

and  often  look  at  your  work  within  it,  and  it  will  then  be  seen  in  re- 
verse, and  will  appear  to  be  by  the  hand  of  some  other  master,  and 
you  will  be  better  able  to  judge  of  its  faults  than  in  any  other  way. 

It  is  also  a  good  plan  every  now  and  then  to  go  away  and  have  a 
little  relaxation;  for  then  when  you  come  back  to  the  work  your 
judgment  will  be  surer,  since  to  remain  constantly  at  work  will  cause 
you  to  lose  the  power  of  judgment. 

It  is  also  advisable  to  go  some  distance  away,  because  then  the  work 
appears  smaller,  and  more  of  it  is  taken  in  at  a  glance,  and  a  lack  of 
harmony  or  proportion  in  the  various  parts  and  in  the  colours  of  the 
objects  is  more  readily  seen. 

THIS  RULE  OUGHT  TO  BE  GIVEN  TO  CHILDREN  WHO  PAINT 

We  know  clearly  that  the  sight  is  one  of  the  swiftest  actions  that  can 
exist,  for  in  the  same  instant  it  surveys  an  infinite  number  of  forms; 
nevertheless  it  can  only  comprehend  one  thing  at  a  time.  To  take  an 
instance:  you,  O  Reader,  might  at  a  glance  look  at  the  whole  of  this 
written  page,  and  you  would  instantly  decide  that  it  is  full  of  various 
letters,  but  you  will  not  recognise  in  this  space  of  time  either  what 
letters  they  are  or  what  they  purport  to  say,  and  therefore  it  is  neces- 
sary for  you  if  you  wish  to  gain  a  knowledge  of  these  letters  to  take 
them  word  by  word  and  line  by  line. 

Again,  if  you  wish  to  go  up  to  the  summit  of  a  building  it  will  be 
necessary  for  you  to  ascend  step  by  step,  otherwise  it  will  be  impos- 
sible to  reach  the  top.  So  I  say  to  you  whom  nature  inclines  to  this  art 
that  if  you  would  have  a  true  knowledge  of  the  forms  of  different  ob- 
jects you  should  commence  with  their  details,  and  not  pass  on  to  the 
second  until  the  first  is  well  in  your  memory  and  you  have  practised 
it.  If  you  do  otherwise  you  will  be  throwing  away  time,  and  to  a  cer- 
tainty you  will  greatly  prolong  the  period  of  study.  And  remember  to 
acquire  diligence  rather  than  facility.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  28  r. 

OF  THE  CONFORMITY  OF  THE  LIMBS 

Further  I  remind  you  to  pay  great  attention  in  giving  limbs  to  your 
figures,  so  that  they  may  not  merely  appear  to  harmonize  with  the 


PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER  889 

size  of  the  body  but  also  with  its  age.  So  the  limbs  oi  youths  should 
have  few  muscles  and  veins,  and  have  a  soft  surface  and  be  rounded 
and  pleasing  in  colour;  in  men  they  should  be  sinewy  and  full  of 
muscles;  in  old  men  the  surface  should  be  wrinkled,  and  rough,  and 
covered  with  veins,  and  with  the  sinews  greatly  protruding. 

How  little  children  have  their  joints  the  reverse  of  those  of  men  in 
their  thickness: 

Little  children  have  all  the  joints  slender  while  the  intervening  parts 
are  thick;  and  this  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  joints  are  only  covered  by 
skin  and  there  is  no  flesh  at  all  over  them,  and  this  skin  acts  as  a  sinew 
to  gird  and  bind  together  the  bones;  and  a  flabby  layer  of  flesh  is 
found  between  one  joint  and  the  next,  shut  in  between  the  skin  and 
the  bone.  But  because  the  bones  are  thicker  at  the  joints  than  between 
them,  the  flesh  as  the  man  grows  up  loses  that  superfluity  which  existed 
between  the  skin  and  the  bone,  and  so  the  skin  is  drawn  nearer  to  the 
bone  and  causes  the  limbs  to  seem  more  slender.  But  since  there  is 
nothing  above  the  joints  except  cartilaginous  and  sinewy  skin,  this  can- 
not dry  up,  and  not  being  dried  up  it  does  not  shrink.  So  for  these 
reasons  the  limbs  of  children  are  slender  at  the  joints  and  thick  be- 
tween the  joints,  as  is  seen  in  the  joints  of  the  fingers,  arms,  and 
shoulders  which  are  slender  and  have  great  dimples;  and  a  man  on  the 
contrary  has  all  the  joints  of  fingers,  arms,  and  legs  thick,  and  where 
children  have  hollows  men  have  the  joints  protruding. 

OF  THE  DIFFERENCE  OF  THE  MEASUREMENTS  IN  BOYS 

AND  MEN 

I  find  a  great  difference  between  men  and  small  boys  in  the  length 
from  one  joint  to  another;  for  whereas  the  distance  from  the  joint  of 
the  shoulder  to  the  elbow,  and  from  the  elbow  to  the  tip  of  the  thumb, 
and  from  the  humerus  of  one  of  the  shoulders  to  the  other,  in  a  man 
is  twice  the  head,  in  a  child  it  is  only  once,  because  nature  fashions 
the  stature  of  the  seat  of  the  intellect  for  us  before  that  of  its  active 
members.

OF  THE  RENDERING  OF  THE  LIGHTS 

Make  first  a  general  shadow  over  the  whole  of  the  extended  part 
which  does  not  see  the  light;  then  give  to  it  the  half  shadows  and  the 
strong  shadows,  contrasting  these  one  with  another.

To  make  a  head  so  that  its  features  are  in  agreement  with  those  of 
a  head  that  turns  and  bends,  use  these  means:  you  know  that  the  eyes, 
eyebrows,  nostrils,  corners  of  the  mouth  and  sides  of  the  chin,  jaw, 
cheeks,  ears  and  all  the  parts  of  a  face  are  placed  at  regular  positions 
upon  the  face,  therefore  when  you  have  made  the  face,  make  lines 
which  pass  from  one  corner  of  the  eye  to  the  other;  and  so  also  for 
the  position  of  each  feature.  Then  having  continued  the  ends  of  these 
lines  beyond  the  two  sides  of  the  face,  observe  whether  on  the  right 
and  the  left  the  spaces  in  the  same  parallel  are  equal.  But  I  would  spe- 
cially remind  you  that  you  must  make  these  lines  extend  to  the  point 
of  your  vision. 

The  way  to  represent  the  eighteen  actions  of  man:  [these  are]  rest, 
movement,  speed;  erect,  leaning,  seated,  bending,  kneeling,  lying 
down,  suspended;  carrying,  being  carried,  pushing,  dragging,  striking, 
being  struck,  pressing  down  and  raising  up. 

You  will  treat  first  of  the  lights  cast  by  windows  to  which  you  will 
give  the  name  of  restricted  light;  then  treat  of  the  lights  of  landscape 
to  which  you  will  give  the  name  of  free  light;  then  treat  of  the  light 
of  luminous  bodies. 


HOW  TO  MAKE  AN  IMAGINARY  ANIMAL  APPEAR  NATURAL 

You  know  that  you  cannot  make  any  animal  without  it  having  its 
limbs  such  that  each  bears  some  resemblance  to  that  of  some  one  of  the 
other  animals.  If  therefore  you  wish  to  make  one  of  your  imaginary 


PRECEPTS   OF   THE   PAINTER  891 

animals  appear  natural — let  us  suppose  it  to  be  a  dragon — take  for  its 
head  that  of  a  mastiff  or  setter,  for  its  eyes  those  of  a  cat,  for  its  cars 
those  of  a  porcupine,  for  its  nose  that  of  a  greyhound,  with  the  eye- 
brows of  a  lion,  the  temples  of  an  old  cock  and  the  neck  of  a  water- 
tortoise. 

OF  DRAWING  AN  OBJECT 

See  that  when  you  are  drawing  and  make  a  beginning  of  a  line, 
that  you  look  over  all  the  object  that  you  are  drawing  for  any  detail 
whatever  which  lies  in  the  direction  of  the  line  that  you  have  begun. 

ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  29  r. 

How  a  figure  is  not  worthy  of  praise  unless  such  action  appears  in 
it  as  serves  to  express  the  passion  of  the  soul: 

That  figure  is  most  worthy  of  praise  which  by  its  action  best  ex- 
presses the  passion  which  animates  it. 

HOW  ONE  OUGHT  TO  REPRESENT  AN  ANGRY  FIGURE 

An  angry  figure  should  be  represented  seizing  someone  by  the  hair 
and  twisting  his  head  down  to  the  ground,  with  one  knee  on  his  ribs, 
and  with  the  right  arm  and  fist  raised  high  up;  let  him  have  his  hair 
dishevelled,  his  eyebrows  low  and  knit  together,  his  teeth  clenched,  the 
two  corners  of  his  mouth  arched,  and  the  neck  which  is  all  swollen  and 
extended  as  he  bends  over  the  foe,  should  be  full  of  furrows. 

HOW  TO  REPRESENT  A  MAN  IN  DESPAIR 

A  man  who  is  in  despair  you  should  make  turning  his  knife  against 
himself,  and  rending  his  garments  with  his  hands,  and  one  of  his  hands 
should  be  in  the  act  of  tearing  open  his  wound.  Make  him  with  his 
feet  apart,  his  legs  somewhat  bent,  and  the  whole  body  likewise  bend- 
ing to  the  ground,  and  with  his  hair  torn  and  streaming. 

OF  THE  GRACE  OF  THE  LIMBS 

The  limbs  should  fit  the  body  gracefully  in  harmony  with  the  effect 
you  wish  the  figure  to  produce;  and  if  you  desire  to  create  a  figure 


892  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

which  shall  possess  a  charm  of  its  own,  you  should  make  it  with  limbs 
graceful  and  extended,  without  showing  too  many  of  the  muscles,  and 
the  few  which  your  purpose  requires  you  to  show  indicate  briefly,  that 
is  without  giving  them  prominence,  and  with  the  shadows  not  sharply 
defined,  and  the  limbs,  and  especially  the  arms,  should  be  easy,  that  is 
that  no  limb  should  be  in  a  straight  line  with  the  part  that  adjoins  it. 
And  if  the  hips  which  form  as  it  were  the  poles  of  the  man,  are  by 
his  position  placed  so  that  the  right  is  higher  than  the  left,  you  should 
make  the  top  shoulder-joint  so  that  a  line  drawn  from  it  perpendicu- 
larly falls  on  the  most  prominent  part  of  the  hip,  and  let  this  right 
shoulder  be  lower  than  the  left. 

And  let  the  hollow  of  the  throat  always  be  exactly  over  the  middle  of 
the  joint  of  the  foot  which  is  resting  on  the  ground.  The  leg  which 
does  not  support  the  weight  should  have  its  knee  below  the  other  and 
near  to  the  other  leg. 

The  positions  of  the  head  and  arms  are  numberless,  and  therefore  I 
will  not  attempt  to  give  any  rule;  it  will  suffice  that  they  should  be 
natural  and  pleasing  and  should  bend  and  turn  in  various  ways,  with 
the  joints  moving  freely  so  that  they  may  not  seem  like  pieces  of  wood. 

HOW  THE  CAST  SHADOW  IS  NEVER  EQUAL  IN  SIZE 
TO  ITS  CAUSE 

If  as  experience  shows  luminous  rays  come  from  a  single  point,  and 
proceed  in  the  form  of  a  sphere  from  this  point  radiating  and  spread- 
ing themselves  through  the  air,  the  farther  they  go  the  more  they  are 
dispersed;  and  an  object  placed  between  the  light  and  the  wall  is  al- 
ways reproduced  larger  in  its  shadow,  because  the  rays  that  strike  it 
have  become  larger  by  the  time  they  have  reached  the  wall. 

ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  29  v. 


OF  THE  ARRANGEMENT  OF  THE  LIMBS 

As  regards  the  arrangement  of  the  limbs,  you  should  bear  in  mind 
that  when  you  wish  to  represent  one  who  by  some  chance  has  either 
to  turn  backwards  or  on  one  side,  you  must  not  make  him  move  his 
feet  and  all  his  limbs  in  the  same  direction  as  he  turns  his  head;  but 


PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER  893 

you  should  show  the  process  spreading  itself  and  taking  efTect  over  the 
four  sets  of  joints,  namely  those  of  the  foot,  the  knee,  the  hip,  and  the 
neck.  And  if  you  let  his  weight  rest  on  the  right  leg,  you  should  make 
the  knee  of  the  left  bend  inwards;  and  the  foot  of  it  should  be  slightly 
raised  on  the  outside,  and  the  left  shoulder  should  be  somewhat  lower 
than  the  right;  and  the  nape  of  the  neck  should  be  exactly  above  the 
outer  curve  of  the  ankle  of  the  left  foot,  and  the  left  shoulder  should 
be  above  the  toe  of  the  right  foot  in  a  perpendicular  line.  And  always 
so  dispose  your  figures  that  the  direction  in  which  the  head  is  turned 
is  not  that  in  which  the  breast  faces,  since  nature  has  for  our  con- 
venience so  formed  the  neck  that  it  can  easily  serve  the  different  oc- 
casions on  which  the  eye  desires  to  turn  in  various  directions;  and  to 
this  same  organ  the  other  joints  are  in  part  responsive.  And  if  ever 
you  show  a  man  sitting  with  his  hands  at  work  upon  something  by  his 
side,  make  the  chest  turn  upon  the  hip  joints. 

OF  THE  SHADOW  CAST  BY  A  BODY  SITUATED  BETWEEN 
TWO  EQUAL  LIGHTS 

A  body  which  finds  itself  placed  between  two  equal  lights  will  put 
forth  two  shadows,  which  will  take  their  direction  equally  according 
to  the  lines  of  the  two  lights.  And  if  you  move  the  body  farther  away 
or  bring  it  nearer  to  one  of  the  lights,  the  shadow  which  points  to  the 
nearer  light  will  be  less  deep  than  that  which  points  to  the  one  more 
remote. 

THE  BODY  NEARER  TO  THE  LIGHT  WILL  CAST  THE 
LARGER  SHADOW,  AND  WHY 

If  an  object  placed  in  front  of  a  particular  light  be  very  near  to  it 
you  will  see  it  cast  a  very  large  shadow  on  the  opposite  wall,  and  the 
farther  you  remove  the  object  from  the  light  the  smaller  will  the 
shadow  become. 

WHY  A  SHADOW  WHICH  IS  GREATER  THAN  ITS  CAUSE 
WILL  BE  OUT  OF  PROPORTION 

The  want  of  proportion  of  the  shadow  which  is  greater  than  its 
cause,  arises  from  the  fact  that  as  the  light  is  less  than  its  object  it  can- 


894  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

not  be  at  an  equal  distance  from  the  extremities  of  the  object,  and  the 
part  which  is  at  a  greater  distance  increases  more  than  those  which  are 
nearer,  and  therefore  the  shadow  increases. 


WHY  A  SHADOW  WHICH  IS  BIGGER  THAN  THE  BODY 
THAT  CAUSES  IT  HAS  INDISTINCT  CONTOURS 

Atmosphere  which  surrounds  a  light  almost  partakes  of  the  nature 
of  this  light  in  brightness  and  in  warmth;  the  farther  away  it  recedes 
the  more  it  loses  this  resemblance.  An  object  which  casts  a  large  shadow 
is  near  to  the  light  and  finds  itself  lit  up  both  by  the  light  and  by  the 
luminous  atmosphere,  and  consequently  this  atmosphere  leaves  the 
contours  of  the  shadow  indistinct.  ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  30  r. 

THE  WAY  TO  REPRESENT  A  BATTLE 

Show  first  the  smoke  of  the  artillery  mingled  in  the  air  with  the  dust 
stirred  up  by  the  movement  of  the  horses  and  of  the  combatants.  This 
process  you  should  express  as  follows:  the  dust,  since  it  is  made  up  of 
earth  and  has  weight,  although  by  reason  of  its  fineness  it  may  easily 
rise  and  mingle  with  the  air,  will  nevertheless  readily  fall  down  again, 
and  the  greatest  height  will  be  attained  by  such  part  of  it  as  is  the  finest, 
and  this  will  in  consequence  be  the  least  visible  and  will  seem  almost 
the  colour  of  the  air  itself. 

The  smoke  which  is  mingled  with  the  dust-laden  air  will  as  it  rises 
to  a  certain  height  have  more  and  more  the  appearance  of  a  dark  cloud, 
at  the  summit  of  which  the  smoke  will  be  more  distinctly  visible  than 
the  dust.  The  smoke  will  assume  a  bluish  tinge,  and  the  dust  will  keep 
its  natural  colour.  From  the  side  whence  the  light  comes  this  mixture  of 
air  and  smoke  and  dust  will  seem  far  brighter  than  on  the  opposite  side. 

As  for  the  combatants  the  more  they  are  in  the  midst  of  this  turmoil 
the  less  they  will  be  visible,  and  the  less  will  be  the  contrast  between 
their  lights  and  shadows. 

You  should  give  a  ruddy  glow  to  the  faces  and  the  figures  and  the 
air  around  them,  and  to  the  gunners  and  those  near  to  them,  and  this 
glow  should  grow  fainter  as  it  is  farther  away  from  its  cause.  The 
figures  which  are  between  you  and  the  light,  if  far  away,  will  appear 


PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER  895 

dark  against  a  light  background,  and  the  nearer  their  limbs  are  to  the 
ground  the  less  will  they  be  visible,  for  there  the  dust  is  greater  and 
thicker.  And  if  you  make  horses  galloping  away  from  the  throng,  make 
little  clouds  of  dust  as  far  distant  one  from  another  as  is  the  space 
between  the  strides  made  by  the  horse,  and  that  cloud  which  is  farthest 
away  from  the  horse  should  be  the  least  visible,  for  it  should  be  high 
and  spread  out  and  thin,  while  that  which  is  nearest  should  be  most 
conspicuous  and  smallest  and  most  compact. 

Let  the  air  be  full  of  arrows  going  in  various  directions,  some 
mounting  upwards,  others  falling,  others  flying  horizontally;  and  let  the 
balls  shot  from  the  guns  have  a  train  of  smoke  following  their  course. 
Show  the  figures  in  the  foreground  covered  with  dust  on  their  hair  and 
eyebrows  and  such  other  level  parts  as  afford  the  dust  a  space  to  lodge. 

Make  the  conquerors  running,  with  their  hair  and  other  light  things 
streaming  in  the  wind,  and  with  brows  bent  down;  and  they  should  be 
thrusting  forward  opposite  limbs,  that  is,  if  a  man  advances  the  right 
foot,  the  left  arm  should  also  come  forward.  If  you  represent  anyone 
fallen  you  should  show  the  mark  where  he  has  been  dragged  through 
the  dust  which  has  become  changed  to  blood-stained  mire,  and  round 
about  in  the  half-liquid  earth  you  should  show  the  marks  of  the 
trampling  of  men  and  horses  who  have  passed  over  it. 

Make  a  horse  dragging  the  dead  body  of  his  master,  and  leaving 
behind  him  in  the  dust  and  mud  the  track  of  where  the  body  was 
dragged  along. 

Make  the  beaten  and  conquered  pallid,  with  brows  raised  and  knit 
together,  and  let  the  skin  above  the  brows  be  all  full  of  lines  of  pain;  at 
the  sides  of  the  nose  show  the  furrows  going  in  an  arch  from  the 
nostrils  and  ending  where  the  eye  begins,  and  show  the  dilatation  of  the 
nostrils  which  is  the  cause  of  these  lines;  and  let  the  lips  be  arched 
displaying  the  upper  row  of  teeth,  and  let  the  teeth  be  parted  after  the 
manner  of  such  as  cry  in  lamentation.  Show  someone  using  his  hand 
as  a  shield  for  his  terrified  eyes,  turning  the  palm  of  it  towards  the 
enemy,  and  having  the  other  resting  on  the  ground  to  support  the 
weight  of  his  body;  let  others  be  crying  out  with  their  mouths  wide 
open,  and  fleeing  away.  Put  all  sorts  of  armour  lying  between  the  feet 
of  the  combatants,  such  as  broken  shields,  lances,  swords,  and  other 
things  like  these.  Make  the  dead,  some  half-buried  in  dust,  others  with 


896  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

the  dust  all  mingled  with  the  oozing  blood  and  changing  into  crimson 
mud;  and  let  the  line  of  the  blood  be  discerned  by  its  colour,  flowing 
in  a  sinuous  stream  from  the  corpse  to  the  dust.  Show  others  in  the 
death  agony  grinding  their  teeth  and  rolling  their  eyes,  with  clenched 
fists  grinding  against  their  bodies  and  with  legs  distorted.  Then  you 
might  show  one,  disarmed  and  struck  down  by  the  enemy,  turning  on 
him  with  teeth  and  nails  to  take  fierce  and  inhuman  vengeance;  and 
let  a  riderless  horse  be  seen  galloping  with  mane  streaming  in  the  wind, 
charging  among  the  enemy  and  doing  them  great  mischief  with  his 
hoofs. 

You  may  see  there  one  of  the  combatants,  maimed  and  fallen  on  the 
ground,  protecting  himself  with  his  shield,  and  the  enemy  bending 
down  over  him  and  striving  to  give  him  the  fatal  stroke;  there  might 
also  be  seen  many  men  fallen  in  a  heap  on  top  of  a  dead  horse;  and 
you  should  show  some  of  the  victors  leaving  the  combat  and  retiring 
apart  from  the  crowd,  and  with  both  hands  wiping  away  from  eyes 
and  cheeks  the  thick  layer  of  mud  caused  by  the  smarting  of  their  eyes 
from  the  dust.1 

And  the  squadrons  of  the  reserves  should  be  seen  standing  full  of 
hope  but  cautious,  with  eyebrows  raised,  and  shading  their  eyes  with 
their  hands,  peering  into  the  thick,  heavy  mist  in  readiness  for  the 
commands  of  their  captain;  and  so  too  the  captain  with  his  staff  raised, 
hurrying  to  the  reserves  and  pointing  out  to  them  the  quarter  of  the 
field  where  they  are  needed;  and  you  should  show  a  river,  within 
which  horses  are  galloping,  stirring  the  water  all  around  with  a  heav- 
ing mass  of  waves  and  foam  and  broken  water,  leaping  high  into  the 
air  and  over  the  legs  and  bodies  of  the  horses;  but  see  that  you  make 
no  level  spot  of  ground  that  is  not  trampled  over  with  blood.

HOW  HIGH  THE  POINT  OF  SIGHT  SHOULD  BE  PLACED 

This  point  ought  to  be  at  the  same  level  as  the  eye  of  an  ordinary 
man;  and  the  end  of  the  flat  country  which  borders  upon  the  sky 
should  be  made  of  the  same  height  as  the  line  where  the  earth  touches 
the  horizon,  except  for  the  mountains  which  are  in  liberty.

HOW   SMALL  FIGURES   OUGHT  CONSEQUENTLY  TO   BE 
LEFT  UNFINISHED 

I  say  that  when  objects  appear  of  minute  size,  it  is  due  to  the  said 
objects  being  at  a  distance  from  the  eye;  and  when  this  is  the  case, 
there  must  of  necessity  be  a  considerable  quantity  of  atmosphere  be- 
tween the  eye  and  the  object,  and  this  atmosphere  interferes  with  the 
distinctness  of  the  form  of  the  objects,  and  consequently  the  minute 
details  of  these  bodies  will  become  indistinguishable  and  unrecog- 
nisable. 

Therefore,  O  painter,  you  should  make  your  lesser  figures  only  sug- 
gested, and  not  highly  finished;  for  if  you  do  otherwise,  you  will  pro- 
duce effects  contrary  to  those  of  nature,  your  mistress. 

The  object  is  small  because  of  the  great  space  which  exists  between 
the  eye  and  it.  This  great  space  contains  within  itself  a  great  quantity 
of  atmosphere;  and  this  atmosphere  forms  of  itself  a  dense  body  which 
interposes  and  shuts  out  from  the  eye  the  minute  details  of  the  objects. 

WHAT  BACKGROUND  A  PAINTER  SHOULD  CHOOSE 
FOR  HIS  WORKS 

Since  one  sees  by  experience  that  all  bodies  are  surrounded  by 
shadow  and  light  it  is  expedient,  O  painter,  that  you  so  dispose  the  part 
illuminated  that  it  is  outlined  against  a  dark  object,  and  that  in  the 
same  way  the  part  of  the  body  in  shadow  is  outlined  against  a  bright 
object.  And  this  rule  will  be  a  great  help  to  you  in  giving  relief  to 
your  figures. 

OF  DRAWING 

When  you  have  to  draw  from  nature  stand  three  times  as  far  away 
as  the  size  of  the  object  that  you  are  drawing. 
Why  does  a  painting  seem  better  in  a  mirror  than  outside  it? 

HOW  IN  ALL  TRAVELS  ONE  MAY  LEARN 

This  benign  nature  so  provides  that  over  all  the  world  you  find 
something  to  imitate. 


898  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

OF  SHADOW 

Where  the  shadow  is  bounded  by  light,  note  carefully  where  it  is 
lighter  or  darker,  and  where  it  is  more  or  less  indistinct  towards  the 
light;  and  above  all  I  would  remind  you  that  in  youthful  figures  you 
should  not  make  the  shadows  end  like  stone,  for  the  flesh  retains  a 
slight  transparency,  as  may  be  observed  by  looking  at  a  hand  held 
between  the  eye  and  the  sun,  when  it  is  seen  to  flush  red  and  to  be  of 
a  luminous  transparency. 

And  let  the  part  which  is  brightest  in  colour  be  between  the  lights 
and  the  shadows.  And  if  you  wish  to  see  what  depth  of  shadow  is 
needed  for  the  flesh,  cast  a  shadow  over  it  with  your  finger,  and 
according  as  you  wish  it  to  be  lighter  or  darker,  hold  your  finger  nearer 
or  farther  away  from  the  picture,  and  then  copy  this  shadow. 

OF  HOW  TO  DEPICT  A  WILD  LANDSCAPE 

Those  trees  and  shrubs  which  are  more  split  up  into  a  quantity  of 
thin  branches  ought  to  have  less  density  of  shadow.  The  trees  and  the 
shrubs  which  have  larger  leaves  cast  a  greater  shadow. 

ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  31  v. 

HOW  ONE  OUGHT  TO  ARRANGE  THE  LIGHT  UPON  FIGURES 

The  disposition  of  the  light  should  be  in  harmony  with  the  natural 
conditions  under  which  you  represent  your  figure;  that  is,  if  you  are 
representing  it  in  sunlight,  make  the  shadows  dark  with  great  spaces 
of  light,  and  mark  the  shadows  of  all  the  surrounding  bodies  and  their 
shadows  upon  the  ground.  If  you  represent  it  in  dull  weather,  make 
only  a  slight  difference  between  the  lights  and  the  shadows,  and  do  not 
make  any  other  shadow  at  the  feet.  If  you  represent  it  within  doors, 
make  a  strong  difference  between  the  lights  and  shadows  and  show  the 
shadow  on  the  ground,  and  if  you  represent  a  window  covered  by  a 
curtain  and  the  wall  white  there  should  be  little  difference  between  the 
lights  and  shadows.  If  it  is  lit  by  a  fire  you  should  make  the  lights 
ruddy  and  powerful  and  the  shadows  dark;  and  the  shadows  should 
be  sharply  defined  where  they  strike  the  walls  or  the  floor,  and  the 


PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER  899 

farther  away  they  extend  from  the  body  the  broader  and  larger  should 
they  become.  And  if  it  be  lit  in  part  by  the  fire  and  in  part  by  the 
atmosphere,  make  the  part  lit  by  the  atmosphere  the  stronger,  and  let 
that  lit  by  the  fire  be  almost  as  red  as  fire  itself.  And  above  all  let  the 
figures  that  you  paint  have  sufficient  light  and  from  above,  that  is  all 
living  persons  whom  you  paint,  for  the  people  whom  you  see  in  the 
streets  are  all  lighted  from  above;  and  I  would  have  you  know  that 
you  have  no  acquaintance  so  intimate  but  that  if  the  light  fell  on  him 
from  below  you  would  find  it  difficult  to  recognise  him. 


THE  ORDER  OF  LEARNING  TO  DRAW 

First  of  all  copy  drawings  by  a  good  master  made  by  his  art  from 
nature  and  not  as  exercises;  then  from  a  relief,  keeping  by  you  a  draw- 
ing done  from  the  same  relief;  then  from  a  good  model;  and  of  this 
you  ought  to  make  a  practice. 


AT  WHAT  HEIGHT  THE  LIGHT  SHOULD  BE  IN  ORDER 
TO  DRAW  FROM  NATURE 

When  you  are  drawing  from  nature  the  light  should  be  from  the 
north,  so  that  it  may  not  vary;  and  if  it  is  from  the  south  keep  the 
window  covered  with  a  curtain  so  that  though  the  sun  shine  upon  it 
all  day  long  the  light  will  undergo  no  change.  The  elevation  of  the 
light  should  be  such  that  each  body  casts  a  shadow  on  the  ground 
which  is  of  the  same  length  as  its  height. 

WHY  BEAUTIFUL  COLOURS  SHOULD  BE  IN  THE  LIGHTS 

Since  we  see  that  the  quality  of  colours  becomes  known  by  means  of 
light,  it  is  to  be  inferred  that  where  there  is  most  light  there  the  true 
quality  of  the  colour  so  illuminated  will  be  most  visible,  and  where 
there  is  most  shadow  there  the  colour  will  be  most  affected  by  the 
colour  of  the  shadow.  Therefore,  O  painter,  be  mindful  to  show  the 
true  quality  of  the  colours  in  the  parts  which  are  in  light.

900  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

OF  LIGHT  AND  SHADE 

Each  part  of  the  surface  of  a  body  is  in  part  affected  by  the  colour 
of  the  thing  opposite  to  it. 

Example 

If  you  set  a  spherical  body  in  the  midst  of  different  objects,  that  is, 
so  that  on  the  one  side  it  has  the  light  of  the  sun  and  on  the  side 
opposite  there  is  a  wall  illuminated  by  the  sun,  which  may  be  green 
or  some  other  colour,  the  surface  on  which  it  is  resting  being  red  and 
the  two  transverse  sides  dark,  you  will  see  the  natural  colour  of  this 
object  take  on  the  hues  of  those  colours  which  are  over  against  it.  The 
strongest  will  be  that  proceeding  from  the  light,  the  second  that  from 
the  illuminated  wall,  the  third  that  of  the  shadow.  There  yet  remains 
however  a  portion  which  will  take  its  hue  from  the  colour  of  the 
edges. 

The  supreme  misfortune  is  when  theory  outstrips  performance. 

In  the  choice  of  figures  aim  at  softness  and  delicacy  rather  than  that 
they  should  be  stiff  and  wooden. 

HOW   THE   CONDITION   OF   THE   ATMOSPHERE   AFFECTS 
THE  LIGHTS  AND  SHADOWS 

That  body  will  present  the  strongest  contrast  between  its  lights  and 
shadows  which  is  seen  by  the  strongest  light,  such  as  the  light  of  the 
sun  or  at  night  by  the  light  of  a  fire;  but  this  should  rarely  be  em- 
ployed in  painting,  because  the  work  will  remain  hard  and  devoid  of 
grace. 

A  body  which  is  in  a  moderate  light  will  have  but  little  difference 
between  its  lights  and  shadows;  and  this  comes  to  pass  at  the  fall  of 
the  evening,  or  when  there  are  clouds:  works  painted  then  are  soft  in 
feeling  and  every  kind  of  face  acquires  a  charm. 

Thus  in  every  way  extremes  are  injurious.  Excess  of  light  makes 
things  seem  hard;1  and  too  much  darkness  does  not  admit  of  our  sec 
ing  them.  The  mean  is  excellent.

PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER  901 

OF  SMALL  LIGHTS 

The  lights  cast  from  small  windows  also  present  a  strong  contrast 
of  light  and  shadow,  more  especially  if  the  chamber  lit  by  them  is 
large;  and  this  is  not  good  to  use  in  painting. 

ms.  2038  Bib.  Nat.  33  v. 

The  painter  who  draws  by  practice  and  judgment  of  the  eye  without 
che  use  of  reason,  is  like  the  mirror  that  reproduces  within  itself  all 
me  objects  which  are  set  opposite  to  it  without  knowledge  of  the  same. 

c.a.  76  r.  a 

That  countenance  which  in  a  picture  is  looking  full  in  the  face  of 
the  master  who  makes  it  will  always  be  looking  at  all  the  spectators. 
And  the  figure  painted  when  seen  below  from  above  will  always 
appear  as  though  seen  below  from  above,  although  the  eye  of  the 
beholder  may  be  lower  than  the  picture  itself.  c.a.  hi  v.  b 


OF  THE  PARTS  OF  THE  FACE 

If  nature  had  only  one  fixed  standard  for  the  proportions  of  the 
various  parts,  then  the  faces  of  all  men  would  resemble  each  other  to 
such  a  degree  that  it  would  be  impossible  to  distinguish  one  from 
another;  but  she  has  varied  the  five  parts  of  the  face  in  such  a  way  that 
although  she  has  made  an  almost  universal  standard  as  to  their  size, 
she  has  not  observed  it  in  the  various  conditions  to  such  a  degree  as  to 
prevent  one  from  being  clearly  distinguished  from  another. 

c.a.  119  v.  a 


As  the  body  with  great  slowness  produced  by  the  length  of  its  con- 
trary movement  turns  in  greater  space  and  thereby  gives  a  stouter 
blow,  whereas  movements  which  are  continuous  and  short  have  little 
strength — so  study  upon  the  same  subject  made  at  long  intervals  of 
time  causes  the  judgment  to  become  more  perfect  and  the  better  to 
recognise  its  own  mistakes.  And  the  same  is  true  of  the  eye  of  the 
painter  as  it  draws  farther  away  from  his  picture.  c.a.  122  v.  a 

A  picture  or  any  representation  of  figures  ought  to  be  done  in  such  a 
way  that  those  who  see  them  may  be  able  with  ease  to  recognise  from 


902  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

their  attitudes  what  is  passing  through  their  minds.  So  if  you  have  to 
represent  a  man  of  good  repute  in  the  act  of  speaking,  make  his  ges- 
tures accord  with  the  probity  of  his  speech;  and  similarly  if  you  have  to 
represent  a  brutal  man,  make  him  with  fierce  movements  flinging  out 
his  arms  towards  his  hearer,  and  the  head  and  chest  protruding  for- 
ward beyond  the  feet  should  seem  to  accompany  the  hands  of  the 
speaker. 

Just  so  a  deaf  mute  who  sees  two  people  talking,  although  being 
himself  deprived  of  the  power  of  hearing,  is  none  the  less  able  to  divine 
from  the  movements  and  gestures  of  the  speakers  the  subject  of  their 
discussion. 

I  once  saw  in  Florence  a  man  who  had  become  deaf,  who  could  not 
understand  you  if  you  spoke  to  him  loudly,  while  if  you  spoke  softly 
without  letting  the  voice  utter  any  sound,  he  understood  you  merely 
from  the  movement  of  the  lips.  Perhaps,  however,  you  will  say  to  me: 
'But  does  not  a  man  who  speaks  loudly  move  his  lips  like  one  who 
speaks  softly?  And  since  the  one  moves  his  lips  like  the  other,  will  not 
the  one  be  understood  like  the  other?'  As  to  this  I  leave  the  decision  to 
the  test  of  experience.  Set  someone  to  speak  softly  and  then  [louder], 
and  watch  the  lips.  c.a.  139  r.  d 

How  from  age  to  age  the  art  of  painting  continually  declines  and 
deteriorates  when  painters  have  no  other  standard  than  work  already 
done: 

The  painter  will  produce  pictures  of  little  merit  if  he  takes  the  works 
of  others  as  his  standard;  but  if  he  will  apply  himself  to  learn  from  the 
objects  of  nature  he  will  produce  good  results.  This  we  see  was  the  case 
with  the  painters  who  came  after  the  time  of  the  Romans,  for  they  con- 
tinually imitated  each  other,  and  from  age  to  age  their  art  steadily  de- 
clined. 

After  these  came  Giotto  the  Florentine,  and  he — reared  in  mountain 
solitudes,  inhabited  only  by  goats  and  such  like  beasts — turning  straight 
from  nature  to  his  art,  began  to  draw  on  the  rocks  the  movements  of 
the  goats  which  he  was  tending,  and  so  began  to  draw  the  figures  of  all 
the  animals  which  were  to  be  found  in  the  country,  in  such  a  way  that 
after  much  study  he  not  only  surpassed  the  masters  of  his  own  time  but 
all  those  of  many  preceding  centuries.  After  him  art  again  declined, 


PRECEPTS   OF  THE   PAINTER  903 

because  all  were  imitating  paintings  already  done;  and  so  for  centuries 
it  continued  to  decline  until  such  time  as  Tommaso  the  Florentine, 
nick-named  Masaccio,  showed  by  the  perfection  of  his  work  how  those 
who  took  as  their  standard  anything  other  than  nature,  the  supreme 
guide  of  all  the  masters,  were  wearying  themselves  in  vain.  Similarly 
I  would  say  about  these  mathematical  subjects,  that  those  who  study 
only  the  authorities  and  not  the  works  of  nature  are  in  art  the  grand- 
sons and  not  the  sons  of  nature,  which  is  the  supreme  guide  of  the  good 
authorities. 

Mark  the  supreme  folly  of  those  who  censure  such  as  learn  from  na- 
ture, leaving  uncensured  the  authorities  who  were  themselves  the 
disciples  of  this  same  nature!  c.a.  141  r.  b 

OF  COMPOSING  HISTORICAL  SUBJECTS 

Of  not  regarding  the  limbs  of  the  figures  in  historical  subjects,  as 
many  do  who  in  making  whole  figures  spoil  their  arrangement.  For 
when  you  make  figures  one  behind  another,  see  that  you  draw  them  in 
their  entirety,  so  that  the  limbs  which  are  seen  appearing  beyond  the 
surface  of  the  first  figure  may  retain  their  natural  length  and  position. 

c.a.  160  r.  a 

When  a  man  running  wishes  to  use  up  the  impetus  which  is  carry- 
ing him  on,  he  prepares  a  contrary  impetus  which  is  brought  into  op- 
eration by  his  leaning  backwards;  this  is  capable  of  proof,  for  if  the 
impetus  carries  the  moving  body  forward  with  a  momentum  repre- 
sented by  four,  and  the  impulse  of  the  moving  body  to  turn  and  fall 
back  has  a  momentum  of  four  the  one  momentum  will  neutralise  the 
other  which  is  contrary  to  it,  and  so  the  impetus  is  used  up. 

PAINTING 

The  surface  of  each  body  takes  part  of  the  colour  of  whatever  is  set 
against  it.  The  colours  of  the  objects  in  light  are  reproduced  on  each 
other's  surface  at  different  spots  according  to  the  varieties  in  the  posi- 
tions of  these  objects.  [Diagram]  Let  o  be  a  blue  object  in  light,  which 
alone  by  itself  faces  the  space  b  c  of  the  white  sphere  a  b  c  d  e  f,  and

tinges  it  blue;  and  let  m  be  a  yellow  object  which  is  reflected  on  the 
space  a  b  in  company  with  the  blue  object  o,  and  tinges  it  green,  by  the 
second  of  this  which  shows  that  blue  and  yellow  together  produce  a 
most  beautiful  green,  etc. — and  the  rest  will  be  set  forth  in  the  Book 
on  Painting.  In  that  book  it  will  be  demonstrated,  by  transmitting  the 
images  of  the  bodies  and  colours  of  the  things  illuminated  by  the  sun 
through  a  small  round  hole  in  a  dark  place  on  to  a  smooth  surface 
which  in  itself  is  white.  But  everything  will  be  upside  down.

THE  LIFE  OF  THE  PAINTER  IN  THE  COUNTRY

The  painter  requires  such  knowledge  of  mathematics  as  belongs  to 
painting,  and  severance  from  companions  who  are  not  in  sympathy 
with  his  studies,  and  his  brain  should  have  the  power  of  adapting  itself 
to  the  tenor  of  the  objects  which  present  themselves  before  it,  and  he 
should  be  freed  from  all  other  cares. 

And  if  while  considering  and  examining  one  subject  a  second  should 
intervene,  as  happens  when  an  object  occupies  the  mind,  he  ought  to 
decide  which  of  these  subjects  presents  greater  difficulties  in  investiga- 
tion, and  follow  that  until  it  becomes  entirely  clear,  and  afterwards 
pursue  the  investigation  of  the  other.  And  above  all  he  should  keep  his 
mind  as  clear  as  the  surface  of  a  mirror,  which  becomes  changed  to  as 
many  different  colours  as  are  those  of  the  objects  within  it,  and  his 
companions  should  resemble  him  in  a  taste  for  these  studies,  and  if 
he  fail  to  find  any  such  he  should  accustom  himself  to  be  alone  in 
his  investigations,  for  in  the  end  he  will  find  no  more  profitable 
companionship.  c.a.  184  v.  c 

OF  THE  ORDER  TO  BE  OBSERVED  IN  STUDY 

I  say  that  one  ought  first  to  learn  about  the  limbs  and  how  they  are 
worked,  and  after  having  completed  this  knowledge  one  ought  to 
study  their  actions  in  the  different  conditions  in  which  men  are  placed, 
and  thirdly  to  devise  figure  compositions,  the  studies  for  these  being 
taken  from  natural  actions  made  on  occasion  as  opportunities  offered; 
and  one  should  be  on  the  watch  in  the  streets  and  squares  and  fields,

and  there  make  sketches  with  rapid  strokes  to  represent  features,  that 
is  for  a  head  one  may  make  an  o,  and  lor  an  arm  a  straight  or  curved 
line,  and  so  in  like  manner  for  the  legs  and  trunk,  afterwards  when 
back  at  home  working  up  these  notes  in  a  completed  form. 

My  opponent  says  that  in  order  to  gain  experience  and  to  learn  how 
to  work  readily,  it  is  better  that  the  first  period  of  study  should  be  spent 
in  copying  various  compositions  made  by  different  masters  either  on 
sheets  of  paper  or  on  walls,  since  from  these  one  acquires  rapidity  in 
execution  and  a  good  method.  But  to  this  it  may  be  replied  that  the 
ensuing  method  would  be  good  if  it  was  founded  upon  works  that  were 
excellent  in  composition  and  by  diligent  masters;  and  since  such  masters 
are  so  rare  that  few  are  to  be  found,  it  is  safer  to  go  direct  to  the  works 
of  nature  than  to  those  which  have  been  imitated  from  her  originals 
with  great  deterioration  and  thereby  to  acquire  a  bad  method,  for  he 
who  has  access  to  the  fountain  does  not  go  to  the  water-pot. 

c.a.  199  v.  a 

These  rules  are  to  be  used  solely  in  testing  figures;  for  every  man  in 
his  first  compositions  makes  certain  mistakes,  and  if  he  does  not  become 
conscious  of  them  he  does  not  correct  them;  therefore  in  order  to  dis- 
cover mistakes  you  should  test  your  work  and  where  you  find  there  mis- 
takes correct  them,  and  remember  never  to  fall  into  them  again.  But  if 
you  were  to  attempt  to  apply  all  these  rules  in  composition  you  would 
never  make  a  beginning  and  would  cause  confusion  in  your  work. 

These  rules  are  intended  to  help  you  to  a  free  and  good  judgment; 
for  good  judgment  proceeds  from  good  understanding,  and  good  under- 
standing comes  from  reason  trained  by  good  rules,  and  good  rules  are 
the  children  of  sound  experience,  which  is  the  common  mother  of  all 
the  sciences,  and  arts.  If  therefore  you  bear  well  in  mind  the  precepts 
of  my  rules  you  will  be  able  merely  by  the  accuracy  of  your  judgment 
to  criticize  and  discern  every  error  in  proportion  in  any  work,  whether 
it  is  in  the  perspective  or  in  the  figures  or  other  things,    c.a.  221  v.  d 

All  the  limbs  of  every  kind  of  animal  should  correspond  with  its  age, 
that  is,  the  young  should  not  show  their  veins  or  nerves  as  most  [paint- 
ers] do  in  order  to  show  their  dexterity  in  art,  spoiling  the  whole  by 
mistakes  in  the  limbs. 


906  PRECEPTS  OF  THE  PAINTER 

All  the  parts  of  an  animal  should  correspond  with  the  whole,  that  is, 
when  a  man  is  short  and  thickset  you  must  see  that  each  of  his  limbs  is 
short  and  thickset. 

Let  the  movements  of  men  be  such  as  are  in  keeping  with  their 
dignity  or  meanness.  c.a.  345  v.  b 

Make  your  work  to  be  in  keeping  with  your  purpose  and  design; 
that  is,  when  you  make  your  figure  you  should  consider  carefully  who 
it  is  and  what  you  wish  it  to  be  doing. 

In  order  to  produce  an  effect  of  similar  action  in  a  picture  of  an 
old  man  and  a  young,  you  must  make  the  action  of  the  young  man 
appear  more  vigorous  in  proportion  as  he  is  more  powerful  than  the 
old  man,  and  you  will  make  the  same  difference  between  a  young 
man  and  an  infant. 

If  you  have  to  represent  a  man  either  as  moving  or  lifting  or  pulling, 
or  carrying  a  weight  equal  to  his  own  weight,  how  ought  you  to  fit  the 
legs  under  his  body?  c.a.  349  r.  b 

Painters  oftentimes  deceive  themselves  by  representing  water  in 
which  they  render  visible  what  is  seen  by  man;  whereas  the  water  sees 
the  object  from  one  side  and  the  man  sees  it  from  the  other;  and  it 
frequently  happens  that  the  painter  will  see  a  thing  from  above  and  the 
water  sees  it  from  beneath,  and  so  the  same  body  is  seen  in  front  and 
behind,  and  above  and  below,  for  the  water  reflects  the  image  of  the 
object  in  one  way  and  the  eye  sees  it  in  another.  c.a.  354  r.  d 

We  consider  as  a  monstrosity  one  who  has  a  very  large  head  and 
short  legs,  and  as  a  monstrosity  also  one  who  is  in  great  poverty  and

in  whom  the  parts  are  in  harmony  with  the  whole.  c.a.  375  r.  c 

OF  THE  ERROR  WHICH  IS  COMMITTED  IN  JUDGING 
AS  TO  THE  LIMBS 

The  painter  who  has  clumsy  hands  will  reproduce  the  same  in  his 
works,  and  the  same  thing  will  happen  with  every  limb  unless  long 
study  prevents  it.  Do  you  then,  O  painter,  take  careful  note  of  that  part 
in  yourself  which  is  most  mis-shapen,  and  apply  yourself  by  study  to

remedy  this  entirely.  For  if  von  are  brutal,  your  figures  will  be  the 
same  and  devoid  of  grace,  and  in  like  manner  every  quality  that  there 
is  within  you  of  good  or  of  evil  will  be  in  part  revealed  in  your  figures.

When  you  draw  nudes  be  careful  always  to  draw  the  whole  figure, 
and  then  finish  the  limb  which  seems  the  best  and  at  the  same  time 
study  its  relation  to  the  other  limbs,  as  otherwise  you  may  form  the 
habit  of  never  properly  joining  the  limbs  together. 

Take  care  never  to  make  the  head  turn  the  same  way  as  the  chest 
nor  the  arm  move  with  the  leg;  and  if  the  head  is  turned  towards  the 
right  shoulder  make  all  the  parts  lower  on  the  left  side  than  on 
the  right,  but  if  you  make  the  chest  prominent  and  the  head  turning 
on  the  left  side,  then  make  the  parts  on  the  right  side  higher  than 
those  on  the  left.  a  28  v. 

Note  in  the  movements  and  attitudes  of  the  figures  how  the  limbs 
and  their  expressions  vary,  because  the  shoulder  blades  in  the  move- 
ments of  the  arms  and  shoulders  alter  considerably  the  position  of  the 
backbone;  and  you  will  find  all  the  causes  of  this  in  my  book  of 
Anatomy. 

OF  SHADOWS  AND  LIGHTS 

You,  who  reproduce  the  works  of  nature,  behold  the  dimensions,  the 
degrees  of  intensity,  and  the  forms  of  the  lights  and  shadows  of  each 
muscle,  and  observe  in  the  lengths  of  their  figures  towards  which 
muscle  they  are  directed  by  the  axis  of  their  central  lines.        e  3  r. 


OF  THE  BACKGROUND  OF  THE  FIGURES  IN  PAINTING 

The  background  that  surrounds  the  figures  in  any  subject  composi- 
tion ought  to  be  darker  than  the  illuminated  part  of  these  figures,  and 
lighter  than  their  part  in  shadow.  e  4  r. 

That  every  part  of  a  whole  should  be  in  proportion  to  its  whole: 
thus  if  a  man  has  a  thick  short  figure  that  he  should  be  the  same  in 
every  one  of  his  limbs,  that  is,  with  short  thick  arms,  big  hands,  fingers 
thick  and  short,  with  joints  of  the  same  character  and  so  with  the  rest.

And  I  would  have  the  same  understood  to  apply  to  all  kinds  of  animals 
and  plants;  thus,  in  diminishing  the  parts,  do  so  in  proportion  to  their 
size,  as  also  in  enlarging. 


OF  HOW  TO  PAINT  WIND 

In  representing  wind,  in  addition  to  showing  the  bending  of  the 
boughs  and  the  inverting  of  their  leaves  at  the  approach  of  the  wind, 
you  should  represent  the  clouds  of  fine  dust  mingled  with  the  troubled 
air.  e  6  v. 

OF  THE  REQUISITES  OF  PAINTING 

The  first  requisite  of  painting  is  that  the  bodies  which  it  represents 
should  appear  in  relief,  and  that  the  scenes  which  surround  them  with 
effects  of  distance  should  seem  to  enter  into  the  plane  in  which  the  pic- 
ture is  produced  by  means  of  the  three  parts  of  perspective,  namely  the 
diminution  in  the  distinctness  of  the  form  of  bodies,  the  diminution  in 
their  size,  and  the  diminution  in  their  colour.  Of  these  three  divisions 
of  perspective,  the  first  has  its  origin  in  the  eye,  the  two  others  are 
derived  from  the  atmosphere  that  is  interposed  between  the  eye  and  the 
objects  which  the  eye  beholds. 

The  second  requisite  of  painting  is  that  the  actions  should  be  appro- 
priate and  have  a  variety  in  the  figures,  so  that  the  men  may  not  all 
look  as  though  they  were  brothers.  e  79  v. 

OF  VARIETY  IN  FIGURES 

The  painter  ought  to  strive  at  being  universal,  for  there  is  a  great 
lack  of  dignity  in  doing  one  thing  well  and  another  badly,  like  many 
who  study  only  the  measurements  and  proportions  of  the  nude  figure 
and  do  not  seek  after  its  variety;  for  a  man  may  be  properly  propor- 
tioned and  yet  be  fat  and  short  or  long  and  thin,  or  medium.  And  who- 
ever does  not  take  count  of  these  varieties  will  always  make  his  figures 
in  one  mould,  so  that  they  will  all  appear  sisters,  and  this  practice 
deserves  severe  censure.

OF  THE  ORDER  OF  ACQUIRING  THIS  UNIVERSALITY 

It  is  an  easy  matter  for  whoever  knows  how  to  represent  man  to 
afterwards  acquire  this  universality,  for  all  the  animals  which  live  upon 
the  earth  resemble  each  other  in  their  limbs,  that  is  in  muscles,  sinews 
and  bones,  and  they  do  not  vary  at  all,  except  in  length  or  thickness  as 
will  be  shown  in  the  Anatomy.  There  are  also  the  aquatic  animals,  of 
which  there  are  many  different  kinds;  but  with  regard  to  these  I  do  not 
advise  the  painter  to  make  a  fixed  standard,  for  they  are  of  almost 
infinite  variety;  and  the  same  is  also  true  of  the  insect  world,  g  5  v. 


REPRESENTATION  OF  A  DELUGE 

The  air  was  dark  from  the  heavy  rain  which  was  falling  slantwise, 
bent  by  the  cross-current  of  the  winds,  and  formed  itself  in  waves  in  the 
air,  like  those  one  sees  formed  by  the  dust,  the  only  difference  being 
that  these  drifts  were  furrowed  by  the  lines  made  by  the  drops  of  the 
falling  water.  It  was  tinged  by  the  colour  of  the  fire  produced  by  the 
thunder-bolts  wherewith  the  clouds  were  rent  and  torn  asunder,  the 
flashes  from  which  smote  and  tore  open  the  vast  waters  of  the  flooded 
valleys,  and  as  these  lay  open  there  were  revealed  their  depths  x  the 
bowed  tops  of  the  trees. 

Neptune  might  be  seen  with  his  trident  in  the  midst  of  the  waters, 
and  iEolus  with  his  winds  should  be  shown  entangling  the  floating 
trees  which  had  been  uprooted  and  were  mingled  with  the  mighty 
waves. 

The  horizon  and  the  whole  firmament  was  overcast  and  lurid  with 
the  flashings  of  the  incessant  lightning. 

Men  and  birds  might  be  seen  crowded  together  upon  the  tall  trees 
which  over-topped  the  swollen  waters,  forming  hills  which  surround 
the  great  abysses.  g  6  v.

OF  THE  ERROR  MADE  BY  THOSE  WHO  PRACTISE 
WITHOUT  SCIENCE  l 

Those  who  are  enamoured  of  practice  without  science  are  like  a 
pilot  who  goes  into  a  ship  without  rudder  or  compass  and  never  ha* 
any  certainty  where  he  is  going. 

Practice  should  always  be  based  upon  a  sound  knowledge  of  theory, 
of  which  perspective  is  the  guide  and  gateway,  and  without  it  nothing 
can  be  done  well  in  any  kind  of  painting.  c  8  r.

Of  men  and  horses  labouring  in  battle,  the  different  parts  should  be 
darker  in  proportion  as  they  are  closer  to  the  ground  on  which  they  are 
supported;  and  this  is  proved  from  the  sides  of  wells,  which  become 
darker  in  proportion  to  their  depth,  this  being  due  to  the  fact  that  the 
lowest  part  of  the  well  sees  and  is  seen  by  a  lesser  amount  of  the 
luminous  atmosphere  than  any  other  part  of  it.  And  the  pavements 
when  they  are  the  same  colour  as  the  legs  of  the  men  and  horses  will 
always  seem  in  higher  light  within  equal  angles  than  will  these  same 
legs.  c  15  r. 

HOW  TO  PASS  JUDGMENT  UPON  A  PAINTER'S  WORK 

First  you  should  consider  the  figures  whether  they  have  the  relief 
which  their  position  requires,  and  the  light  that  illuminates  them,  so 
that  the  shadows  may  not  be  the  same  at  the  extremities  of  the  com- 
position as  in  the  centre,  because  it  is  one  thing  for  a  figure  to  be 
surrounded  by  shadows,  and  another  for  it  to  have  the  shadows  only  on 
one  side.  Those  figures  are  surrounded  by  shadows  which  are  towards 
the  centre  of  the  composition,  because  they  are  shaded  by  the  dark  figures 
interposed  between  them  and  the  light;  and  those  are  shaded  on  one 
side  only  which  are  interposed  between  the  light  and  the  main  group, 
for  where  they  do  not  face  the  light  they  face  the  group,  and  there  they 
reproduce  the  darkness  cast  by  this  group,  and  where  they  do  not  face 
the  group  they  face  the  brightness  of  the  light,  and  there  they  reproduce 
its  radiance.

Secondly,  you  should  consider  whether  the  distribution  or  arrange- 
ment of  the  figures  is  devised  in  agreement  with  the  conditions  you 
desire  the  action  to  represent. 

Thirdly,  whether  the  figures  are  actively  engaged  on  their  purpose. 

g  19  r. 

OF  PAINTING 

A  very  important  part  of  painting  consists  in  the  backgrounds  of  the 
things  painted.  Against  these  backgrounds  the  contour  lines  of  such 
natural  bodies  as  possess  convex  curves  will  always  reveal  the  shapes  of 
these  bodies,  even  though  the  colours  of  the  bodies  are  of  the  same  hue 
as  the  background. 

This  arises  from  the  fact  of  the  convex  boundaries  of  the  objects  not 
being  illuminated  in  the  same  manner  as  the  background  is  by  the  same 
light,  because  frequently  the  contours  are  clearer  or  darker  than  the 
background. 

Should  however  these  contours  be  of  the  same  colour  as  the  back- 
ground, then  undoubtedly  this  part  of  the  picture  will  interfere  with  the 
perception  of  the  figure  formed  by  these  contour  lines.  Such  a  predica- 
ment in  painting  ought  to  be  avoided  by  the  judgment  of  good  painters, 
since  the  painter's  intention  is  to  make  his  bodies  appear  detached  from 
the  background;  and  in  the  above-mentioned  instance  the  contrary 
occurs,  not  only  in  the  painting  but  in  the  objects  in  relief.      g  23  v. 


AN  INDICATION  WHETHER  A  YOUTH  HAS  AN  APTITUDE 

FOR  PAINTING 

There  are  many  men  who  have  a  desire  and  love  for  drawing  but 
no  aptitude  for  it,  and  this  can  be  discerned  in  children  if  they  are  not 
diligent  and  never  finish  their  copies  with  shading. 

The  painter  is  not  worthy  of  praise  who  does  only  one  thing  well, 
as  the  nude,  or  a  head,  or  draperies,  or  animal  life,  or  landscapes,  or 
such  other  special  subject;  for  there  is  no  one  so  dull  of  understanding 
that  after  devoting  himself  to  one  subject  only  and  continually  practis- 
ing at  this,  he  will  fail  to  do  it  well.  g  25  r.

[The  representation  of  things  in  movement} 

Of  the  imitation  of  things  which  though  they  have  movement  in 
their  own  place,  do  not  in  this  movement  reveal  themselves  as  they  are 
in  reality. 

Drops  of  water  when  it  rains,  a  winder,  the  turning-wheel,  stones 
under  the  action  of  water,  firebrands  whirled  round  in  a  circle,  proceed 
continuously,  among  things  which  are  not  in  continuous  movement. 

g  35  r. 

THE  BOUNDARIES  OF  BODIES  ARE  THE  LEAST  OF  ALL 

THINGS 

The  truth  of  this  proposition  is  proved  by  the  fact  that  the  boundary 
of  the  substance  is  a  surface,  which  is  neither  a  part  of  the  body  enclosed 
by  this  surface  nor  a  part  of  the  atmosphere  which  surrounds  this  body, 
but  is  the  medium  interposed  between  the  atmosphere  and  the  body, 
as  is  proved  in  its  place. 

But  the  lateral  boundaries  of  these  bodies  are  the  boundary  line  of 
the  surface,  which  line  is  of  invisible  thickness.  Therefore,  O  painter, 
do  not  surround  your  bodies  with  lines,  and  especially  when  making 
objects  less  than  their  natural  size,  for  these  not  only  cannot  show  their 
lateral  boundaries,  but  their  parts  will  be  invisible,  from  distance.

The  high  lights  or  the  lustre  of  any  particular  object  will  not  be

It  is  a  necessary  thing  for  the  painter,  in  order  to  be  able  to  fashion 
the  limbs  correctly  in  the  positions  and  actions  which  they  can  represent 
in  the  nude,  to  know  the  anatomy  of  the  sinews,  bones,  muscles  and 
tendons  in  order  to  know,  in  the  various  different  movements  and  im- 
pulses, which  sinew  or  muscle  is  the  cause  of  each  movement,  and  to 
make  only  these  prominent  and  thickened,  and  not  the  others  all  over 
the  limb,  as  do  many  who  in  order  to  appear  great  draughtsmen  make 
their  nudes  wooden  and  without  grace,  so  that  it  seems  rather  as  if  you 
were  looking  at  a  sack  of  nuts  than  a  human  form  or  at  a  bundle  of 
radishes  rather  than  the  muscles  of  nudes.  l  79  r. 

In  all  things  seen  one  has  to  consider  three  things,  namely  the  posi-

of  the  light  that  illumines  this  body.  m  80  r. 

[With  sketch] 

In  the  last  folds  of  the  joints  of  any  limb  everything  which  was  in 
relief  becomes  a  hollow,  and  similarly  every  hollow  in  the  last  of  the 
said  folds  is  changed  into  a  protuberance  when  the  end  of  the  limb  is 
straightened. 

He  who  has  not  knowledge  of  this,  often  makes  very  great  mistakes 
through  relying  too  much  upon  his  own  skill,  and  not  having  recourse 
to  the  imitation  of  nature.  And  such  variation  is  found  more  in  the 
middle  of  the  sides  than  in  front  and  more  behind  than  at  the  sides.

Let  the  dark,  gloomy  air  be  seen  beaten  by  the  rush  of  opposing 
winds  wreathed  in  perpetual  rain  mingled  with  hail,1  and  bearing 
hither  and  thither  a  vast  network  of  the  torn  branches  of  trees  mixed 
together  with  an  infinite  number  of  leaves.  All  around  let  there  be  seen 
ancient  trees  uprooted  and  torn  in  pieces  by  the  fury  of  the  winds.  You 
should  show  how  fragments  of  mountains,  which  have  been  already

rents and  choke  up  the  valleys,  until  the  pent-up  rivers  rise  in  flood  and

covei  the  wide  plains  and  their  inhabitants.  Again  there  might  be  seen 
huddled  together  on  the  tops  of  many  of  the  mountains  many  different 
sorts  of  animals,  terrified  and  subdued  at  last  to  a  state  of  tameness,  in 
company  with  men  and  women  who  had  fled  there  with  their  children. 
And  the  fields  which  were  covered  with  water  had  their  waves  covered 
over  in  great  part  with  tables,  bedsteads,  boats  and  various  other  kinds 
of  rafts,  improvised  through  necessity  and  fear  of  death,  upon  which 
were  men  and  women  with  their  children,  massed  together  and  utter- 
ing various  cries  and  lamentations,  dismayed  by  the  fury  of  the  winds 
which  were  causing  the  waters  to  roll  over  and  over  in  mighty  hurri- 
cane, bearing  with  them  the  bodies  of  the  drowned;  and  there  was  no 
object  that  floated  on  the  water  but  was  covered  with  various  different 
animals  who  had  made  truce  and  stood  huddled  together  in  terror, 
among  them  being  wolves,  foxes,  snakes  and  creatures  of  every  kind, 
fugitives  from  death.  And  all  the  waves  that  beat  against  their  sides 
were  striking  them  with  repeated  blows  from  the  various  bodies  of  the 
drowned,  and  the  blows  were  killing  those  in  whom  life  remained. 

Some  groups  of  men  you  might  have  seen  with  weapons  in  their 
hands  defending  the  tiny  footholds  that  remained  to  them  from  the 
lions  and  wolves  and  beasts  of  prey  which  sought  safety  there.  Ah, 
what  dreadful  tumults  one  heard  resounding  through  the  gloomy  air, 
smitten  by  the  fury  of  the  thunder  and  the  lightning  it  flashed  forth, 
which  sped  through  it,  bearing  ruin,  striking  down  whatever  withstood 
its  course!  Ah,  how  many  might  you  have  seen  stopping  their  ears 
with  their  hands  in  order  to  shut  out  the  loud  uproar  caused  through 
the  darkened  air  by  the  fury  of  the  winds  mingled  together  with  the 
rain,  the  thunder  of  the  heavens  and  the  raging  of  the  thunderbolts! 
Others  were  not  content  to  shut  their  eyes,  but  placing  their  hands  over 
them,  one  above  the  other,  would  cover  them  more  tightly  in  order  not 
to  see  the  pitiless  slaughter  made  of  the  human  race  by  the  wrath  of 
God. 

Ah  me,  how  many  lamentations!  How  many  in  their  terror  flung 
themselves  down  from  the  rocks!  You  might  have  seen  huge  branches 
of  the  giant  oaks  laden  with  men  borne  along  through  the  air  by  the 
fury  of  the  impetuous  winds.  How  many  boats  were  capsized  and 
lying,  some  whole,  others  broken  in  pieces,  on  the  top  of  men  struggling 
to  escape  with  acts  and  gestures  of  despair  which  foretold  an  awful

death.  Others  with  frenzied  acts  were  taking  their  own  lives,  in  despair 
of  ever  being  able  to  endure  such  anguish;  some  of  these  were  flinging 
themselves  down  from  the  lofty  rocks,  others  strangled  themselves  with 
their  own  hands;  some  seized  hold  of  their  own  children,  and  with 
mighty  violence  slew  them  at  one  blow;  some  turned  their  arms  against 
themselves  to  wound  and  slay;  others  falling  upon  their  knees  were 
commending  themselves  to  God. 

Alas!  how  many  mothers  were  bewailing  their  drowned  sons,  hold- 
ing them  upon  their  knees,  lifting  up  open  arms  to  heaven,  and  with 
divers  cries  and  shrieks  declaiming  against  the  anger  of  the  gods! 
Others  with  hands  clenched  and  fingers  locked  together  gnawed  and 
devoured  them  with  bites  that  ran  blood,  crouching  down  so  that  their 
breasts  touched  their  knees  in  their  intense  and  intolerable  agony. 

Herds  of  animals,  such  as  horses,  oxen,  goats,  sheep,  were  to  be  seen 
already  hemmed  in  by  the  waters  and  left  isolated  upon  the  high  peaks 
of  the  mountains,  all  huddling  together,  and  those  in  the  middle  climb- 
ing to  the  top  and  treading  on  the  others,  and  waging  fierce  battles  with 
each  other,  and  many  of  them  dying  from  want  of  food. 

And  the  birds  had  already  begun  to  settle  upon  men  and  other 
animals,  no  longer  finding  any  land  left  unsubmerged  which  was  not 
covered  with  living  creatures.  Already  had  hunger,  the  minister  of 
death,  taken  away  their  life  from  the  greater  number  of  the  animals, 
when  the  dead  bodies  already  becoming  lighter  began  to  rise  from  out 
the  bottom  of  the  deep  waters,  and  emerged  to  the  surface  among  the 
contending  waves;  and  there  lay  beating  one  against  another,  and  as 
balls  puffed  up  with  wind  rebound  back  from  the  spot  where  they 
strike,  these  fell  back  and  lay  upon  the  other  dead  bodies. 

And  above  these  horrors  the  atmosphere  was  seen  covered  with 
murky  clouds  that  were  rent  by  the  jagged  course  of  the  raging  thun- 
derbolts of  heaven,  which  flashed  light  hither  and  thither  amid  the 
obscurity  of  the  darkness. 

The  velocity  of  the  air  is  seen  by  the  movement  of  the  dust  stirred 
by  the  running  of  a  horse;  and  it  moves  as  swiftly  to  fill  up  the  void  left 
in  the  air  which  had  enclosed  the  horse  as  is  the  speed  of  the  horse  in 
passing  away  from  the  aforesaid  space  of  air.

DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  DELUGE 

First  of  all  let  there  be  represented  the  summit  of  a  rugged  mountain 
with  certain  of  the  valleys  that  surround  its  base,  and  on  its  sides  let  the 
surface  of  the  soil  be  seen  slipping  down  together  with  the  tiny  roots  of 
the  small  shrubs,  and  leaving  bare  a  great  part  of  the  surrounding 
rocks.  Sweeping  down  in  devastation  from  these  precipices,  let  it  pursue 
its  headlong  course,  striking  and  laying  bare  the  twisted  and  gnarled 
roots  of  the  great  trees  and  overturning  them  in  ruin.  And  the  moun- 
tains becoming  bare  should  reveal  the  deep  fissures  made  in  them  by 
the  ancient  earthquakes;  and  let  the  bases  of  the  mountains  be  in  great

fallen  headlong  from  the  sides  of  the  lofty  peaks  of  the  said  mountains,

with  various  kinds  of  leaves  thrust  in  among  the  mud  and  earth  and 
stones.  And  let  the  fragments  of  some  of  the  mountains  have  fallen 
clown  into  the  depth  of  one  of  the  valleys,  and  there  form  a  barrier  to 
the  swollen  waters  of  its  river,  which  having  already  burst  the  barrier 
rushes  on  with  immense  waves,  the  greatest  of  which  are  striking  and 
laying  in  ruin  the  walls  of  the  cities  and  farms  of  the  valley.  And  from 
the  ruins  of  the  lofty  buildings  of  the  aforesaid  cities  let  there  rise  a 
great  quantity  of  dust,  mounting  up  in  the  air  with  the  appearance  of 
smoke  or  of  wreathed  clouds  that  battle  against  the  descending  rain. 

But  the  swollen  waters  should  be  coursing  round  the  pool  which  con- 
fines them,  and  striking  against  various  obstacles  with  whirling  eddies, 
leaping  up  into  the  air  in  turbid  foam,  and  then  falling  back  and  caus- 
ing the  water  where  they  strike  to  be  dashed  up  into  the  air;  and  the 
circling  waves  which  recede  from  the  point  of  contact  are  impelled  by 
their  impetus  right  across  the  course  of  the  other  circling  waves  which 
move  in  an  opposite  direction  to  them,  and  after  striking  against  these 
they  leap  up  into  the  air  without  becoming  detached  from  their  base. 

And  where  the  water  issues  forth  from  the  said  pool,  the  spent  waves 
are  seen  spreading  out  towards  the  outlet;  after  which,  falling  or 
descending  through  the  air,  this  water  acquires  weight  and  impetus; 
and  then  piercing  the  water  where  it  strikes,  it  tears  it  apart  and  dives 
down  in  fury  to  reach  its  depth,  and  then  recoiling,  it  springs  back 
again  towards  the  surface  of  the  lake  accompanied  by  the  air  which  has 
been  submerged  with  it,  and  this  remains  in  the  slimy  foam  *  mingled 
with  the  driftwood  and  other  things  lighter  than  the  water,  and  around 
these  again  are  formed  the  beginnings  of  the  waves,  which  increase  the 
more  in  circumference  as  they  acquire  more  movement;  and  this  move- 
ment makes  them  lower  in  proportion  as  they  acquire  a  wider  base,  and 
therefore  they  become  almost  imperceptible  as  they  die  away.  But  if  the 
waves  rebound  against  various  obstacles  then  they  leap  back  and  oppose 
the  approach  of  the  other  waves,  following  the  same  law  of  develop- 
ment in  their  curve  as  they  have  already  shown  in  their  original  move- 
ment. The  rain  as  it  falls  from  the  clouds  is  of  the  same  colour  as  these 
clouds,  that  is  on  its  shaded  side,  unless,  however,  the  rays  of  the  sun

should  penetrate  there,  for  if  this  were  so  the  rain  would  appear  less 
dark  than  the  cloud.  And  if  the  great  masses  of  the  debris  of  huge 
mountains  or  of  large  buildings  strike  in  their  fall  the  mighty  lakes  oi 
the  waters,  then  a  vast  quantity  of  water  will  rebound  in  the  air,  and  its 
course  will  be  in  an  opposite  direction  to  that  of  the  substance  which 
struck  the  water,  that  is  to  say  the  angle  of  reflection  will  be  equal  to 
the  angle  of  incidence. 

Of  the  objects  borne  along  by  the  current  of  the  waters,  that  will  be 
at  a  greater  distance  from  the  two  opposite  banks  which  is  heavier  or  of 
larger  bulk.  The  eddies  of  the  waters  revolve  most  swiftly  in  those  parts 
which  are  nearest  to  their  centre.  The  crests  of  the  waves  of  the  sea  fall 
forward  to  their  base,  beating  and  rubbing  themselves  against  the 
smooth  particles  which  form  their  face;  and  by  this  friction  the  water  as 
it  falls  is  ground  up  in  tiny  particles,1  and  becomes  changed  to  thick 
mist,  and  is  mingled  in  the  currents  of  the  winds  in  the  manner  of 
wreathing  smoke  or  winding  clouds,  and  at  last  rises  up  in  the  air  and 
becomes  changed  into  clouds.  But  the  rain  which  falls  through  the  air, 
being  beaten  upon  and  driven  by  the  current  of  the  winds,  becomes  rare 
or  dense  according  to  the  rarity  or  density  of  these  winds,  and  by  this 
means  there  is  produced  throughout  the  air  a  flood  of  transparent 
clouds  which  is  formed  by  the  aforesaid  rain,  and  becomes  visible  in  it 
by  means  of  the  lines  made  by  the  fall  of  the  rain  which  is  near  to  the 
eye  of  the  spectator.2  The  waves  of  the  sea  that  beats  against  the  shelv- 
ing base  of  the  mountains  which  confine  it,  rush  3  foaming  in  speed  up 
to  the  ridge  of  these  same  hills,  and  in  turning  back  meet  the  onset  of 
the  succeeding  wave,  and  after  loud  roaring  return  in  a  mighty  flood 
to  the  sea  from  whence  they  came.  A  great  number  of  the  inhabitants, 
men  and  different  animals,  may  be  seen  driven  by  the  rising  of  the 
deluge  up  towards  the  summits  of  the  hills  which  border  on  the  said 
waters.

[A  discussion  on  the  colours  of  shadows] 

PAINTING 

Colours  seen  in  shadow  will  reveal  more  or  less  of  their  natural 
beauty  in  proportion  as  they  are  in  fainter  or  deeper  shadow. 

But  if  the  colours  happen  to  be  in  a  luminous  space  they  will  show 
themselves  of  greater  beauty  in  proportion  as  the  luminosity  is  more 
intense. 

Adversary 

The  varieties  in  the  colours  of  shadows  are  as  numerous  as  the 
varieties  in  colour  of  the  objects  which  are  in  the  shadows. 

Reply 

Colours  seen  in  shadow  will  reveal  less  variety  one  with  another 
according  as  the  shadows  wherein  they  lie  are  deeper.  There  is  evi- 
dence of  this  from  those  who  from  a  space  without  peer  within  the 
doorways  of  shadowy  temples,  for  there  the  pictures  clad  as  they  are 
in  divers  colours  all  seem  robed  in  darkness. 


COLOUR  923 

So  therefore  at  a  long  distance  all  the  shadows  of  different  colours 
appear  of  the  same  darkness. 

Of  bodies  clad  in  light  and  shade  it  is  the  illuminated  part  which 
reveals  the  true  colour.  e  18  r. 

No  white  or  black  is  transparent.  f  23  r. 

PAINTING 

Since  white  is  not  a  colour  but  is  capable  of  becoming  the  recipient 
of  every  colour,  when  a  white  object  is  seen  in  the  open  air  all  its 
shadows  are  blue;  and  this  comes  about  in  accordance  with  the  fourth 
proposition,  which  says  that  the  surface  of  every  opaque  body  par- 
takes of  the  colour  of  surrounding  objects.  As  therefore  this  white 
object  is  deprived  of  the  light  of  the  sun  by  the  interposition  of  some 
object  which  comes  between  the  sun  and  it,  all  that  portion  of  it  which 
is  exposed  to  the  sun  and  the  atmosphere  continues  to  partake  of  the 
colour  of  the  sun  and  the  atmosphere,  and  that  part  which  is  not 
exposed  to  the  sun  remains  in  shadow,  and  partakes  only  of  the 
colour  of  the  atmosphere. 

And  if  this  white  object  should  neither  reflect  the  green  of  the  fields 
which  stretch  out  to  the  horizon  nor  yet  face  the  brightness  of  the 
horizon  itself,  it  would  undoubtedly  appear  of  such  simple  colour  as 
the  atmosphere  showed  itself  to  be.  f  75  r. 

OF  THE  ACCIDENTAL  COLOURS  OF  TREES 

The  accidental  colours  of  the  leaves  of  trees  are  four,  namely  shadow, 
light,  lustre  and  transparency. 

OF  THE  VISIBILITY  OF  THESE  ACCIDENTAL  COLOURS 

The  accidental  parts  of  the  leaves  of  plants  will  at  a  great  distance 
become  a  mixture,  in  which  the  accidental  colour  of  the  largest  will 
predominate.  g  24  r. 

OF  PAINTING 

The  colour  of  the  object  illuminated  partakes  of  the  colour  of  that 
which  illuminates  it.  g  37  r. 


924  COLOUR 

The  surface  of  every  body  participates  in  the  colour  of  the  body  that 
illuminates  it:  • 

And  in  the  colour  of  the  air  that  is  interposed  between  the  eye  and 
this  body,  that  is  to  say  in  the  colour  of  the  transparent  medium  inter- 
posed between  the  object  and  the  eye. 

Among  colours  of  the  same  quality,  the  second  will  never  be  of  the 
same  colour  as  the  first;  and  this  proceeds  from  the  multiplication  of 
the  colour  of  the  medium  interposed  between  the  object  and  the  eye. 

G53  v. 

Of  the  various  colours  other  than  blue,  that  which  at  a  great  distance 
will  resemble  blue  most  closely  will  be  that  which  is  nearest  to  black, 
and  so  conversely  the  colour  which  least  resembles  black  will  be  the 
one  which  at  a  great  distance  will  most  retain  its  natural  colour. 

Accordingly,  the  green  in  landscapes  will  become  more  changed  into 
blue  than  will  the  yellow  or  the  white,  and  so  conversely  the  yellow 
and  the  white  will  undergo  less  change  than  the  green,  and  the  red 
still  less.  l  75  v.

objects  strike  the  objects  at  more  equal  angles. 

And  the  surface  of  opaque  bodies  is  more  steeped  in  the  colour  of 
their  object,  in  proportion  as  this  surface  is  whiter,  and  the  colour  of 
the  object  more  luminous  or  illuminated.  Quaderni  vi  22  r. 


WHETHER  THE  COLOURS  OF  THE  RAINBOW  ARE  CREATED 

BY  THE  SUN 

The  colours  of  the  rainbow  are  not  created  by  the  sun,  because  in 
many  ways  these  colours  are  produced  without  the  sun,  as  happens 
when  you  hold  up  a  glass  of  water  close  to  the  eye,  for  in  the  glass  of 
it  there  are  the  tiny  bubbles  which  are  usually  seen  in  glass  that  is 
imperfectly  refined.  And  these  bubbles  although  they  are  not  in  sun- 
light will  produce  on  one  side  all  the  colours  of  the  rainbow;  and  this 
you  will  see  if  you  place  the  glass  between  the  atmosphere  and  your 
eye  in  such  a  way  as  to  be  in  contact  with  the  eye,  the  glass  having 
one  side  exposed  to  the  light  of  the  atmosphere,  and  on  the  other  the 
shadow  of  the  wall  on  the  right  or  left  side  of  the  window,  which  side 
does  not  matter.  So  by  turning  this  glass  round  you  will  see  the  afore- 
said colours  round  about  these  bubbles  in  the  glass.  And  we  will  speak 
of  other  methods  in  their  place. 

HOW  THE  EYE  HAS  NO  SHARE  IN  THE  CREATION  OF  THE 
COLOURS  OF  THE  RAINBOW 

The  eye  in  the  experiment  described  above  would  seem  to  have  some 
share  in  the  creation  of  the  colours  of  the  rainbow,  because  the  bub- 


926  COLOUR 

bles  in  the  glass  do  not  display  these  colours  except  through  the  me- 
dium of  the  eye.  But  if  you  place  this  glass  full  of  water  on  the  level 
of  the  window,  so  that  the  sun's  rays  strike  it  on  the  opposite  side,  you 
will  then  see  the  aforesaid  colours  producing  themselves,  in  the  im- 
pression made  by  the  solar  rays  which  have  penetrated  through  this 
glass  of  water,  and  terminated  upon  the  floor  in  a  dark  place  at  the 
foot  of  the  window;  and  since  here  the  eye  is  not  employed  we  clearly 
can  say  with  certainty  that  these  colours  do  not  derive  in  any  way  from 
the  eye. 

OF  THE  COLOURS  FOUND  IN  THE  FEATHERS  OF  CERTAIN 

BIRDS 

There  are  many  birds  in  the  various  regions  of  the  world  in  whose 
feathers  most  radiant  colours  are  seen  produced  in  their  different 
movements,  as  is  seen  happen  among  us  with  the  feathers  of  peacocks, 
or  on  the  necks  of  ducks  or  pigeons. 

Moreover  on  the  surface  of  ancient  glass  found  buried,  and  in  the 
roots  of  radishes  which  have  been  kept  a  long  time  at  the  bottom  of 
wells  or  other  stagnant  water  [we  see]  that  each  of  these  roots  is  sur- 
rounded by  a  sequence  of  colours  like  those  of  the  rainbow.  It  is  seen 
when  some  oily  substance  has  spread  on  the  top  of  water;  as  also  in 
the  solar  rays  reflected  from  the  surface  of  a  diamond  or  beryl.  Also, 
in  the  facet  of  the  beryl,  every  dark  object  which  has  as  its  background 
the  atmosphere  or  other  clear  object  is  surrounded  by  this  sequence  of 
colours  interposed  between  the  atmosphere  and  the  dark  object;  and 
so  in  many  other  ways  which  I  leave  because  these  suffice  for  this 
present  theme.  Windsor:  Drawings  191 50  r.

Within  the  spaces  between  the  rain  one  sees  the  redness  of  the  sun; 
that  is  of  the  clouds  interposed  between  the  sun  and  the  rain. 

The  waves  interposed  between  the  rain  and  the  eye  never  reveal  to 
the  eye  the  image  of  the  darkness  of  this  rain,  and  this  is  due  to  the 
fact  that  the  side  of  the  wave  is  not  seen  nor  does  it  see  the  rain. 

And  the  clouds  are  of  dark  purple.  c.a.  38  r.  b

A  mountain  that  stretches  above  a  city  which  raises  dust  in  the  form 
of  clouds,  but  the  colour  of  this  dust  is  varied  by  the  colour  of  these 
clouds;  and,  where  the  rain  is  thickest,  the  colour  of  the  dust  is  least 
visible;  and,  where  the  dust  is  thickest,  the  rain  is  least  visible;  and, 
where  the  rain  is  mingled  with  the  wind  and  the  dust,  the  clouds  cre- 
ated by  the  rain  are  more  transparent  than  those  of  the  dust. 

And  when  the  flames  of  the  fire  are  mingled  with  clouds  of  smoke

928  LANDSCAPE 

When  rain  is  falling  from  broken  clouds  one  sees  the  shadows  of 
these  clouds  upon  the  earth  interrupted  by  the  part  of  the  earth  that 
is  illuminated  by  the  sun. 

OF  THE  RAINBOW 

When  the  sun  is  lower  the  arc  has  a  larger  circle,  and  when  it  is 
higher  it  will  be  the  contrary. 

When  the  sun  is  in  the  west,  hidden  behind  some  small  and  thick 
cloud,  then  this  cloud  will  be  surrounded  by  a  ruddy  splendour. 

c.a.  97  v.  a 

Why  towers  and  campaniles  at  a  great  distance,  although  of  uni- 
form thickness,  seem  like  inverted  pyramids. 

This  arises  from  the  fact  that  the  lower  tracts  of  air  being  thick  and 
misty  veil  them  more  completely,  and  the  more  an  object  is  veiled 
the  more  the  perception  of  its  extremities  is  lost,  and  consequently  the 
perception  of  the  object  tends  to  concentrate  about  its  central  line.

WHERE  SHADOW  IS  LESS  THAN  LIGHT 

In  the  houses  of  a  city,  where  one  observes  that  the  divisions  between 
them  are  clear  when  it  is  misty  below,  if  the  eye  is  above  the  level  of 
the  houses  the  lines  of  vision,  as  they  descend  in  the  space  that  is 
between  house  and  house,  plunge  into  mist  which  is  more  dense  and 
therefore,  being  less  transparent,  seems  whiter;  and  if  one  house  is 
higher  than  another  the  reality  is  more  to  be  discerned  in  the  thinner 
air,  and  therefore  they  seem  more  indistinct  in  proportion  as  they  are 
less  1  elevated.  c.a.  160  r.  a 

This  came  about  by  reason  of  the  clouds  interposed  between  the 
earth  and  the  sun,  wherefore  being  in  the  west  it  grew  red  and  with 
its  ruddy  glow  lit  as  with  a  haze  all  the  things  visible  to  it,  but  so 
much  more  or  less  in  proportion  as  these  things  were  nearer  or  more 
remote.  c.a.  165  v.  b 

At  the  first  hour  of  the  day  the  atmosphere  in  the  south  near  to  the 
horizon  has  a  dim  haze  of  rose-flushed  clouds;  towards  the  west  it 
grows  darker,  and  towards  the  east  the  damp  vapour  of  the  horizon

shows  brighter  than  the  actual  horizon  itself,  and  the  white  of  the 
houses  in  the  east  is  scarcely  to  be  discerned,  while  in  the  south,  t he- 
farther  distant  they  are,  the  more  they  assume  a  dark  rose-flushed 
hue,  and  even  more  so  in  the  west;  and  with  the  shadows  it  is  the 
contrary,  for  these  disappear  before  the  white. 

[....]  in  the  east,  and  the  tops  of  the  trees  are  more  visible  than 
their  bases,  since  the  atmosphere  is  thicker  lower  down,  and  the  struc- 
ture becomes  more  indistinct  at  a  height. 

And  in  the  south,  the  trees  may  scarcely  be  distinguished  by  reason 
of  the  vapour  which  darkens  in  the  west  and  grows  clear  in  the  east.

OF  PAINTING  IN  THE  COUNTRY 

If  between  the  eye  and  the  horizon  there  intervenes  the  slope  of  a 
hill  that  drops  towards  the  eye,  and  the  eye  finds  itself  at  about  the 
middle  of  the  height  of  the  slope  then  the  hill  will  acquire  darkness 
with  every  stage  of  its  length.  This  is  proved  by  the  seventh  of  this 
which  says;  that  plant  will  show  itself  darker  which  is  seen  more  be- 
low; therefore  the  proposition  is  confirmed,  because  the  hill  shows 
from  the  centre  downwards  all  its  plants  in  the  parts  which  are  as 
much  illumined  by  the  brightness  of  the  sky,  as  the  part  which  is 
in  shade  is  shaded  by  the  darkness  of  the  earth.  For  which  reason  it 
is  necessary  that  these  plants  should  be  of  moderate  darkness,  and 
from  this  point  on  towards  the  bases  of  the  hills  the  plants  are  con- 
tinually becoming  brighter  through  the  converse  of  the  seventh  propo- 
sition, for  by  this  seventh  proposition  the  nearer  such  plants  are  to  the 
summit  of  the  hill  the  more  of  necessity  they  become  darker.  And  it 
follows  that  this  darkness  is  not  proportionate  to  the  distance,  from  the 
eighth  proposition  which  says:  that  thing  will  show  itself  darker  which 
finds  itself  in  finer  air;  and  by  the  tenth:  that  will  show  itself  darker 
which  borders  on  the  brighter  background.  c.a.  184  v.  c 

OF  CITIES  OR  OTHER  BUILDINGS  SEEN  IN  THE  EVENING 
OR  MORNING  IN  THE  MIST 

Buildings  seen  at  a  great  distance  in  the  evening  or  morning  through 
mist  or  heavy  atmosphere,  have  only  such  portions  in  light  as  are 


930  LANDSCAPE 

illuminated  by  the  sun  which  is  then  near  the  horizon,  and  the  parts 
of  those  buildings  which  are  not  exposed  to  the  sun  remain  almost  the 
same  dim  neutral  colour  as  the  mist. 

Why  the  higher  things  situated  at  a  distance  are  darker  than  the 
lower  ones  even  though  the  mist  is  of  uniform  thickness: 

Of  the  things  situated  in  mist  or  any  other  dense  atmosphere, 
whether  this  arise  from  vapour  or  smoke  or  distance,  that  will  be 
most  visible  which  is  the  highest,  and  of  things  of  equal  height  that 
will  seem  darkest  which  is  against  a  background  of  the  deepest  mist. 
As  happens  with  the  eye  h,  which  beholding  a  b  c,  towers  of  equal 
height,  sees  c  the  summit  of  the  first  tower  at  r,  situated  below  in  the 
mist  at  two  degrees  of  depth,  and  sees  the  summit  of  the  centre  tower 
b  in  only  one  degree  of  mist;  therefore  the  summit  c  will  show  itself 
darker  than  the  summit  of  the  tower  b.  e  3  v. 


PAINTING 

The  landscapes  which  occur  in  representations  of  winter  should  not 
show  the  mountains  blue  as  one  sees  them  in  summer,  and  this  is 
proved  by  the  fourth  part  of  this  [chapter],  where  it  is  stated  that  of 
the  mountains  seen  at  a  great  distance  that  will  seem  a  deeper  blue 
in  colour  which  is  in  itself  darker;  for  when  the  trees  are  stripped  of 
their  leaves  they  look  grey  in  colour,  and  when  they  are  with  their 
leaves  they  are  green,  and  in  proportion  as  the  green  is  darker  than 
the  grey,  the  green  will  appear  a  more  intense  blue  than  the  grey; 
and  by  the  fifth  part  of  this  [chapter],  the  shadows  of  trees  which  are 
clad  with  leaves  are  as  much  darker  than  the  shadows  of  those  trees 
which  are  stripped  of  leaves  as  the  trees  clad  with  leaves  are  denser 
than  those  without  leaves;  and  thus  we  have  established  our  propo- 
sition. 

The  definition  of  the  blue  colour  of  the  atmosphere  supplies  the 
reason  why  landscapes  are  a  deeper  shade  of  blue  in  summer  than  in 
winter. 

The  shadows  of  trees  set  in  landscapes  do  not  seem  to  occupy  the 
same  positions  in  the  trees  on  the  left  as  in  those  on  the  right,  and  this 
especially  when  the  sun  is  on  the  right  or  the  left.  This  is  proved  by 


LANDSCAPE  931 

the  fourth  which  states: — opaque  bodies  placed  between  the  light 
and  die  eye  will  show-  themselves  entirely  in  shadow;  and  by  thr 
fifth: — the  eye  that  is  interposed  between  the  opaque  body  and  the 
light  sees  the  opaque  body  all  illuminated;  and  by  the  sixth: — when 
the  eye  and  the  opaque  body  are  interposed  between  the  darkness 
and  the  light  the  body  will  be  seen  half  in  shadow  and  half  in  light.

OF  THE  ATMOSPHERE  INTERPOSED  BETWEEN  THE  EYE 
AND  THE  VISIBLE  OBJECT 

The  object  wall  appear  more  or  less  distinct  at  the  same  distance,  in 
proportion  as  the  atmosphere  interposed  between  the  eye  and  this 
object  is  of  greater  or  less  clearness. 

Since  therefore  you  are  aware  that  the  greater  or  less  quantity  of 
atmosphere  interposed  between  the  eye  and  the  object  causes  the  out- 
lines of  these  objects  to  seem  more  or  less  blurred  to  the  eye,  you 
should  represent  the  stages  of  loss  of  definition  of  these  bodies  in  the 
same  proportion  to  each  other  as  that  of  their  distances  from  the  eye 
of  the  beholder.  e  79  v. 

When  the  smoke  from  dry  wood  comes  between  the  eye  of  the 
observer  and  some  dark  space  it  appears  blue. 

So  the  atmosphere  appears  blue  because  of  the  darkness  which  is 
beyond  it;  and  if  you  look  towards  the  horizon  of  the  sky  you  will  see 
that  the  atmosphere  is  not  blue,  and  this  is  due  to  its  density;  and  so, 
at  every  stage  as  you  raise  your  eye  up  from  this  horizon  to  the  sky 
which  is  above  you,  you  will  find  that  the  atmosphere  will  seem 
darker,  and  this  is  because  a  lesser  quantity  of  air  interposes  between 
your  eye  and  the  darkness. 

And  if  you  are  on  the  top  of  a  high  mountain  the  atmosphere  will 
seem  darker  above  you,  just  in  proportion  as  it  becomes  rarer  between 
you  and  the  said  darkness;  and  this  will  be  intensified  at  every  succes- 
sive stage  of  its  height,  so  that  at  the  last  it  will  remain  blue. 

That  smoke  will  appear  the  bluest  which  proceeds  from  the  driest 
wood,  and  is  nearest  to  the  place  of  its  origin,  and  when  it  is  seen 
against  the  darkest  background  with  the  light  of  the  sun  upon  it. 

f  18  r. 


932  LANDSCAPE 

The  smoke  that  penetrates  through  the  air  if  it  is  thick,  and  rises 
out  of  great  flame  which  is  fed  by  damp  wood,  does  not  mingle  with 
it  but  makes  itself  seem  denser  above  than  in  the  centre,  and  does  this 
the  more  when  the  air  is  chilly;  and  the  faint  gleam  that  penetrates  the 
air  is  always  warm  and  always  becoming  fainter,  and  of  the  dust 
which  passes  through  the  air  the  finest  rises  the  highest.  f  88  r. 

Although  leaves  with  a  smooth  surface  are  for  the  most  part  of  the 
same  colour  on  the  right  side  as  on  the  reverse,  it  so  happens  that 
the  side  exposed  to  the  atmosphere  partakes  of  the  colour  of  the  at- 
mosphere, and  seems  to  partake  of  its  colour  more  closely  in  propor- 
tion as  the  eye  is  nearer  to  it  and  sees  it  more  foreshortened.  And  the 
shadows  will  invariably  appear  darker  on  the  right  side  than  on  the 
reverse,  through  the  contrast  caused  by  the  high  lights  appearing 
against  the  shadow. 

The  under  side  of  the  leaf,  although  its  colour  in  itself  may  be  the 
same  as  that  of  the  right  side,  appears  more  beautiful;  and  this  colour 
is  a  green  verging  upon  yellow;  and  this  occurs  when  the  leaf  is  inter- 
posed between  the  eye  and  the  light  which  illumines  it  from  the  op- 
posite side.  Its  shadows  also  are  in  the  same  positions  as  those  on  the 
opposite  side. 

Therefore,  O  painter,  when  you  make  trees  near  at  hand,  remember 
that  when  your  eye  is  somewhat  below  the  level  of  the  tree  you  will 
be  able  to  see  its  leaves  some  on  the  right  side  and  some  on  the  reverse; 
and  the  right  sides  will  be  a  deeper  blue  as  they  are  seen  more  fore- 
shortened, and  the  same  leaf  will  sometimes  show  part  of  the  right  side 
and  part  of  the  reverse,  and  consequently  you  must  make  it  of  two 
colours.  g  3  r.  and  2  v. 

When  there  is  one  belt  of  green  behind  another,  the  high  lights  on 
the  leaves  and  their  transparent  lights  show  more  strongly  than  those 
which  are  against  the  brightness  of  the  atmosphere. 

And  if  the  sun  illumines  the  leaves  without  these  coming  between 
it  and  the  eye,  and  without  the  eye  facing  the  sun,  then  the  high  lights 
and  the  transparent  lights  of  the  leaves  are  extremely  powerful. 

It  is  very  useful  to  make  some  of  the  lower  branches,  and  these 
should  be  dark,  and  should  serve  as  a  background  for  the  illuminated 
belts  of  green  which  are  at  some  little  distance  from  the  first. 


LANDSCAPE  933 

Of  the  darker  greens  seen  from  below,  that  part  is  darkest  which  is 
nearest  to  the  eye,  that  is  to  say  which  is  farthest  from  the  Luminous 
atmosphere.  g  4  r. 

Never  represent  leaves  as  though  transparent  in  the  sun,  because 
they  are  always  indistinct;  and  this  comes  about  because  over  the 
transparency  of  one  leaf  there  will  be  imprinted  the  shadow  of  an- 
other leaf  which  is  above  it;  and  this  shadow  has  definite  outlines  and 
a  fixed  density.  And  sometimes  it  is  the  half  or  third  part  of  the  leaf 
which  is  in  the  shadow,  and  consequently  the  structure  of  such  a  leaf 
is  indistinct,  and  the  imitation  of  it  is  to  be  avoided. 

The  upper  branches  of  the  spreading  boughs  of  trees  keep  nearer  to 
the  parent  bough  than  do  those  below. 

That  leaf  is  less  transparent  which  takes  the  light  at  a  more  acute 
angle.  g  4  v. 

OF  THE  PLANTS  OF  THE  FIELDS 

Of  the  plants  which  take  their  shadows  from  the  trees  which  grow 
among  them,  those  which  are  in  front  of  the  shadow  have  their  stalks 
lighted  up  against  a  background  of  shadow,  and  the  plants  which  are 
in  shadow  have  their  stalks  dark  against  a  light  background,  that  is 
against  a  background  which  is  beyond  the  shadow. 

OF  THE  TREES  WHICH  ARE  BETWEEN  THE  EYE 
AND  THE  LIGHT 

Of  the  trees  which  are  between  the  eye  and  the  light,  the  part  in 
front  will  be  bright,  and  this  brightness  will  be  diversified  by  the 
ramification  of  the  transparent  leaves — as  seen  from  the  under  side — 
with  the  shining  leaves  seen  from  the  right  side,  and  in  the  back- 
ground, below  and  behind,  the  verdure  will  be  dark,  because  it  is  cast 
in  shadow  by  the  front  part  of  the  said  tree;  and  this  occurs  in  trees 
which  are  higher  than  the  eye.  g  9  v. 

OF  DARK  LEAVES  IN  FRONT  OF  TRANSPARENT  ONES 

When  the  leaves  are  interposed  between  the  light  and  the  eye,  then 
that  which  is  nearest  to  the  eye  will  be  the  darkest,  and  that  farthest 


934  LANDSCAPE 

away  will  be  the  lightest,  if  they  are  not  seen  against  the  atmosphere; 
and  this  happens  with  leaves  which  are  beyond  the  centre  of  the  tree, 
that  is  in  the  direction  of  the  light.  g  io  v. 


OF  TREES  AND  THEIR  LIGHT 

The  true  method  of  practice  in  representing  country  scenes,  or  I 
should  say  landscapes  with  their  trees,  is  to  choose  them  when  the 
sun  in  the  sky  is  hidden,  so  that  the  fields  receive  a  diffused  light  and 
not  the  direct  light  of  the  sun,  for  this  makes  the  shadows  sharply  de- 
fined and  very  different  from  the  lights.  guv. 

OF  THE  SHADOWS  OF  VERDURE 

The  shadows  of  verdure  always  approximate  to  blue,  and  so  it  is 
with  every  shadow  of  every  other  thing,  and  they  tend  to  this  colour 
more  entirely  when  they  are  farther  distant  from  the  eye,  and  less  in 
proportion  as  they  are  nearer. 

The  leaves  which  reflect  the  blue  of  the  atmosphere  always  present 
themselves  edgewise  to  the  eye. 

OF  THE  ILLUMINATED  PARTS  OF  VERDURE 
AND  OF  MOUNTAINS 

The  part  illuminated  will  show  more  of  its  natural  colour  at  a  great 
distance  when  it  is  illuminated  by  the  most  powerful  light,    g  15  r. 

OF  SHADOWS  AND  LIGHTS  ON  CITIES 

When  the  sun  is  in  the  east  and  the  eye  is  looking  down  upon  a  city 
from  above,  the  eye  will  see  the  southern  part  of  the  city  with  its  roofs 
half  in  shadow  and  half  in  light,  and  so  also  with  the  northern  part; 
but  the  eastern  part  will  be  all  in  shadow  and  the  western  part  all  in 
light. 

HOW   ONE  SHOULD   REPRESENT  LANDSCAPES 

Landscapes  ought  to  be  represented  so  that  the  trees  are  half  in  light 
and  half  in  shadow;  but  it  is  better  to  make  them  when  the  sun  is 


LANDSCAPE  935 

covered  by  clouds,  for  then  the  trees  are  lighted  up  by  the  general  light 
of  the  sky  and  the  general  shadow  of  the  earth;  and  these  are  so  much 
darker  in  their  parts,  in  proportion  as  these  parts  are  nearer  to  the 
middle  of  the  tree  and  to  the  earth.  c.  19  v 

OF  TREES  IN  THE  SOUTH 

When  the  sun  is  in  the  east,  the  trees  in  the  south  and  north  are 
almost  as  much  in  light  as  in  shadow,  but  the  total  amount  in  light  is 
greater  in  proportion  as  they  are  more  to  the  west,  and  the  total 
amount  in  shadow  is  greater  in  proportion  as  they  are  more  to  the 
east. 

OF  MEADOWS 

When  the  sun  is  in  the  east,  the  grasses  in  the  meadows  and  the 
other  small  plants  are  of  a  most  brilliant  green,  because  they  are  trans- 
parent to  the  sun.  This  does  not  happen  with  the  meadows  in  the 
west,  and  in  those  in  the  south  and  north  the  grasses  are  of  a  moderate 
brilliance  in  their  green.  g  20  v. 

THE  ASPECTS  OF  LANDSCAPES 

When  the  sun  is  in  the  east  all  the  parts  of  trees  which  are  illu- 
minated by  it  are  of  a  most  brilliant  green;  and  this  is  due  to  the  fact 
that  the  leaves  illuminated  by  the  sun  within  half  our  hemisphere, 
namely  the  eastern  half,  are  transparent,  while  within  the  western 
semicircle  the  verdure  has  a  sombre  hue  and  the  air  is  damp  and 
heavy,  of  the  colour  of  dark  ashes,  so  that  it  is  not  transparent  like  that 
in  the  east,  which  is  refulgent,  and  the  more  so  as  it  is  more  full  of 
moisture. 

The  shadows  of  the  trees  in  the  east  cover  a  large  part  of  the  tree, 
and  they  are  darker  in  proportion  as  the  trees  are  thicker  with  leaves. 

g  21  r. 

OF  TREES  IN  THE  EAST 

When  the  sun  is  in  the  east  the  trees  seen  towards  the  east  will 
have  the  light  surrounding  them  all  around  their  shadows,  except 
towards  the  earth,  unless  the  tree  has  been  pruned  in  the  previous 


936  LANDSCAPE 

year;  and  the  trees  in  the  south  and  in  the  north  will  be  half  in 
shadow  and  half  in  light,  and  more  or  less  in  shadow  or  in  light  ac- 
cording as  they  are  more  or  less  to  the  east  or  to  the  west. 

The  fact  of  the  eye  being  high  or  low  causes  a  variation  in  the 
shadows  and  lights  of  trees,  for  when  the  eye  is  above,  it  sees  the  trees 
with  very  little  shadow,  and  when  below  with  a  great  deal  of  shadow. 

The  different  shades  of  green  of  plants  are  as  varied  as  are  their 
species.  g  21  v. 

OF  THE  SHADOWS  OF  TREES 

When  the  sun  is  in  the  east  the  trees  towards  the  west  will  appear 
tx>  the  eye  with  very  little  relief  and  of  almost  imperceptible  grada- 
tion, on  account  of  the  atmosphere  which  lies  very  thick  between  the 
eye  and  these  trees,  according  to  the  seventh  [part]  of  this  [treatise]; 
and  they  are  deprived  of  shadow,  for  although  a  shadow  exists  in  each 
part  of  the  ramification,  it  so  happens  that  the  images  of  shadow  and 
light  which  come  to  the  eye  are  confused  and  blended  together,  and 
cannot  be  discerned  through  the  smallness  of  their  size.  And  the  high- 
est lights  are  in  the  centre  of  the  trees  and  the  shadows  are  toward 
their  extremities,  and  their  separation  is  marked  by  the  shadows  in 
the  spaces  between  these  trees  when  the  forests  are  dense  with  trees; 
and  in  those  which  are  more  scattered  the  contours  are  but  little  seen. 

g  22  r. 

OF  TREES  IN  THE  EAST 

When  the  sun  is  in  the  east  the  trees  in  that  quarter  are  dark  towards 
the  centre,  and  their  edges  are  in  light. 


OF  THE  SMOKE  OF  CITIES 

The  smoke  is  seen  better  and  more  distinctly  in  the  eastern  than  in 
the  western  quarter  when  the  sun  is  in  the  east.  This  is  due  to  two 
causes:  the  first  is  that  the  sun  shines  with  its  rays  through  the  par- 
ticles of  the  smoke,  and  lightens  these  up  and  renders  them  visible; 
the  second  is  that  the  roofs  of  the  houses  seen  in  the  east  at  this  hour 
are  in  shadow,  because  their  slope  prevents  them  from  being  lighted 
by  the  sun;  the  same  happens  with  the  dust,  and  both  the  one  and  the 


LANDSCAPE  937 

other  are  more  charged  with  light  in  proportion  as  they  are  thicker; 

and  they  are  thickest  towards  the  middle. 


G    22    V. 


OF  SMOKE  AND  DUST 

When  the  sun  is  in  the  east  the  smoke  of  cities  will  not  be  visible  in 
the  west,  because  it  is  neither  seen  penetrated  by  the  solar  rays  nor 
against  a  dark  background,  since  the  roofs  of  the  houses  turn  the  same 
side  to  the  eye  that  they  show  to  the  sun,  and  against  this  bright  back- 
ground the  smoke  will  be  scarcely  visible.  But  dust  when  seen  under 
the  same  conditions  will  appear  darker  than  smoke,  because  it  is 
thicker  in  substance  than  smoke,  which  is  made  up  of  vapour.

[Of  trees  penetrated  by  the  air] 

OF  THE  OPEN  SPACES  IN  TREES  THEMSELVES 

The  intervening  region  of  the  air  within  the  bodies  of  trees,  and  the 
spaces  between  the  trees  within  the  air  at  a  great  distance,  do  not 
reveal  themselves  to  the  eye,  for  where  it  requires  an  effort  to  discern 
the  whole  it  would  be  difficult  to  distinguish  the  parts.  But  it  forms  a 
confused  mixture,  which  derives  most  from  that  which  forms  the 
greatest  mass.  The  open  spaces  of  the  tree  being  made  up  of  particles 
of  illuminated  air,  and  being  much  less  than  the  tree,  one  therefore 
loses  sight  of  them  much  sooner  than  one  does  of  the  tree;  but  it  does 
not  therefore  follow  that  they  are  not  there.  Hence  of  necessity  there 
comes  about  a  blending  of  air  and  of  the  darkness  of  the  shaded  tree, 
which  float  together  to  meet  the  eye  of  the  beholder. 

OF  TREES  THAT  COVER  UP  THESE  OPEN  SPACES  IN 
ONE  ANOTHER 

That  part  of  the  tree  will  show  fewer  open  spaces  when  it  has  be- 
hind it,  between  the  tree  and  the  air,  the  greater  mass  of  another  tree. 
So  with  the  tree  a  the  open  spaces  are  not  covered,  nor  in  b,  because 
there  are  no  trees  behind.  But  in  c  there  is  only  open  space  in  the  half, 
that  is  to  say  that  c  is  covered  by  the  tree  d,  and  part  of  the  tree  d  is 


o38  LANDSCAPE 

covered  by  the  tree  e,  and  a  little  beyond  this  all  the  open  spaces  within 
the  circumference  of  the  trees  are  lost,  and  only  those  at  the  sides 
remain.  g  25  v.

against  the  luminous  atmosphere,  as  they  are  more  remote,  approach 
the  spherical  more  closely  in  their  shape,  and  as  they  are  nearer,  so 
they  display  a  greater  divergence  from  the  spherical  form. 

So  the  first  tree  a l  as  being  near  to  the  eye  displays  the  true  form  of 
its  ramification,  but  this  is  somewhat  less  visible  in  b,  and  disappears 
altogether  in  c,  where  not  only  can  none  of  the  branches  of  the  tree  be 
seen,  but  the  whole  tree  can  only  be  recognised  with  great  difficulty. 

Every  object  in  shadow — be  it  of  whatever  shape  you  please — will 
at  a  great  distance  appear  to  be  spherical;  and  this  occurs  because  if  an 
object  be  rectangular,  then  at  a  very  short  distance  its  angles  become 
invisible,  and  a  little  farther  of?  it  loses  more  than  it  retains  of  the  lesser 
sides,  and  so  before  losing  the  whole  it  loses  the  parts,  since  these  are 
less  than  the  whole. 

So  with  a  man  when  so  situated,  you  lose  sight  of  the  legs,  arms  and 
head,  before  the  trunk,  and  then  the  extremities  of  the  length  become 
lost  before  those  of  the  breadth,  and  when  these  have  become  equal 
there  would  be  a  square2  if  the  angles  remained,  but  as  they  are  lost 
there  is  a  sphere.  g  26  v. 

In  the  representation  of  trees  in  leaf  be  careful  not  to  repeat  the 
same  colour  too  often,  for  a  tree  which  has  another  tree  of  the  same 
colour  as  its  background,  but  vary  it  by  making  the  foliage  lighter  or 
darker,  or  of  a  more  vivid  green.  g  27  v. 

OF  THE  LIGHTS  ON  DARK  LEAVES 

The  lights  on  such  leaves  as  are  darkest  in  colour  will  most  closely 
resemble  the  colour  of  the  atmosphere  reflected  in  them;  and  this  is  due

to  the  Eact  that  the  brightness  of  the  illuminated  part  mingling  with  the 
darkness  tonus  ot  itscll  a  blue  colour;  and  this  brightness  proceeds  from 
the  blue  of  the  atmosphere,  which  is  reflected  in  the  smooth  surface  oi 
these  leaves,  thereby  adding  to  the  blueness  which  this  light  usually 
produces  when  it  falls  upon  dark  objects. 


OF  THE  LIGHTS  ON  LEAVES  OF  YELLOWISH  GREEN 

But  leaves  of  yellowish  green  do  not  when  they  reflect  the  atmosphere 
create  a  reflection  which  verges  on  blue;  for  every  object  when  seen  in 
a  mirror  takes  in  part  the  colour  of  this  mirror;  therefore  the  blue  of 
the  atmosphere  reflected  in  the  yellow  of  the  leaf  appears  green,  because 
blue  and  yellow  mixed  together  form  a  most  brilliant  green,  and  there- 
fore the  lustre  on  light  leaves  which  are  yellowish  in  colour  will  be  a 
greenish  yellow. 

OF  TREES  WHICH  ARE  ILLLUMINATED  BY  THE  SUN  OR  BY 
THE  ATMOSPHERE 

The  trees,  illuminated  by  the  sun  and  by  the  atmosphere,  which 
have  leaves  of  a  dark  colour,  will  be  illuminated  on  one  side  by  the 
atmosphere  alone,  and  in  consequence  of  being  thus  illuminated  will 
share  its  blueness;  and  on  the  opposite  side  they  will  be  illuminated 
both  by  the  atmosphere  and  the  sun,  and  the  part  which  the  eye  sees 
illuminated  by  the  sun  will  be  resplendent.  g  28  v. 

The  extremities  of  the  branches  of  trees  if  not  dragged  down  by  the 
weight  of  their  fruit  turn  towards  the  sky  as  much  as  possible. 

The  upper  sides  of  their  leaves  are  turned  towards  the  sky  in  order 
to  receive  nourishment  from  the  dew  that  falls  by  night. 

The  sun  gives  spirit  and  life  to  plants,  and  the  earth  nourishes  them 
with  moisture.  In  this  connection  I  once  made  the  experiment  of  leav- 
ing only  one  small  root  on  a  gourd  and  keeping  this  nourished  with 
water;  and  the  gourd  brought  to  perfection  all  the  fruits  that  it  could 
produce,  which  were  about  sixty  gourds  of  the  long  species;  and  I  set 
myself  diligently  to  consider  the  source  of  its  life,  and  I  perceived  that 
it  was  the  dew  of  the  night  which  steeped  it  abundantly  with  its  mois-

ture  through  the  joints  of  its  great  leaves,  and  thereby  nourished  the  tree 
and  its  offspring,  or  rather  the  seeds  which  were  to  produce  its  off- 
spring. 

The  rule  as  to  the  leaves  produced  on  the  last  of  the  year's  branches 
is  that  on  twin  branches  they  will  grow  in  a  contrary  direction,  that  is, 
that  the  leaves  in  their  earliest  growth  turn  themselves  round  towards 
the  branch,  in  such  a  way  that  the  sixth  leaf  above  grows  over  the  sixth 
leaf  below;  and  the  manner  of  their  turning  is  that  if  one  turns  towards 
its  fellow  on  the  right,  the  other  turns  to  the  left. 

The  leaf  serves  as  a  breast  to  nourish  the  branch  or  fruit  which  grows 
in  the  succeeding  year.  g  32  v. 

OF  LANDSCAPES 

The  dark  colours  of  the  shadows  of  mountains  at  a  great  distance 
take  a  more  beautiful  and  purer  blue  than  those  parts  which  are  in 
light,  and  from  this  it  follows  that  when  the  rock  of  the  mountains  is 
reddish  the  parts  of  it  which  are  in  light  are  fawn-coloured,  and  the 
more  brightly  it  is  illuminated  the  more  closely  will  it  retain  its  natural 
colour.  1  48  r. 

OF    SMOKE 

Smoke  enters  into  the  air  in  the  form  of  a  wave,  like  that  which

Reeds  in  the  light  are  scarcely  visible,  but  between  the  light  and  the 
shade  they  stand  out  well. 

To  represent  landscapes,  choose  when  the  sun  is  at  the  meridian  and 
turn  to  the  west  or  the  east,  and  then  begin  your  work. 

If  you  turn  to  the  north  every  object  placed  on  that  side  will  be 
without  shadow,  and  especially  those  nearest  to  the  shadow  cast  by  your 
head,  and  if  you  turn  to  the  south  every  object  upon  that  side  will  be 
entirely  in  shadow. 

All  the  trees  which  are  towards  the  sun  and  which  have  the  atmos- 
phere for  their  background  will  be  dark,  and  the  other  trees  which 
have  this  darkness  for  their  background  will  be  black  in  the  centre  and 
lighter  towards  the  edges.  l  87  r.

CLASSIFICATION  OF  TREES 

Low,  tall,  thin,  thick,  that  is  with  leaves,  dark,  light,  yellow,  red, 
with  branches  pointing  upwards,  with  branches  that  meet  the  eye,  with 
branches  that  point  downwards,  with  trunks  white,  those  transparent 
in  the  air,  those  not,  those  massed  together,  those  spread  out. 

L  87   V. 

The  line  of  equality  and  that  of  the  horizon  are  the  same. 

m  36  v. 

Landscapes  are  of  a  more  beautiful  azure  when  in  fine  weather  the 
sun  is  at  noon,  than  at  any  other  hour  of  the  day,  because  the  atmos- 
phere is  free  from  moisture;  and  viewing  them  under  such  conditions 
you  see  the  trees  beautiful  towards  their  extremities  and  the  shadows 
dark  towards  the  centre;  and  in  the  farther  distance  the  atmosphere 
which  is  interposed  between  you  and  them  appears  more  beautiful 
when  beyond  it  there  is  some  darker  substance,  and  consequently  the 
azure  is  most  beautiful. 

Objects  seen  from  the  side  on  which  the  sun  is  shining  will  not  show 
you  their  shadows.  But  if  you  are  lower  than  the  sun  you  will  see  what 
was  not  seen  by  the  sun,  and  that  will  be  all  in  shadow. 

The  leaves  of  the  trees  which  are  between  you  and  the  sun  are  of 
five  principal  shades  of  colour,  namely  a  green  most  beautiful,  shining 
and  serving  as  a  mirror  for  the  atmosphere  which  lights  up  objects  that 
cannot  be  seen  by  the  sun,  and  the  parts  in  shadow  that  only  face  the 
earth,  and  those  darkest  parts  which  are  surrounded  by  something  other 
than  darkness. 

Trees  in  the  open  country  which  are  between  you  and  the  sun  seem 
much  more  beautiful  than  those  which  have  you  between  the  sun  and 
themselves;  and  this  is  the  case  because  those  which  are  in  the  same 
direction  as  the  sun  show  their  leaves  transparent  towards  their 
extremities,  and  the  parts  that  are  not  transparent,  that  is  at  the  tips, 
are  shining;  it  is  true  that  the  shadows  are  dark,  because  they  are  not 
covered  by  anything. 

The  trees  when  you  place  yourself  between  them  and  the  sun  will 
only  show  themselves  to  you  in  their  clear  and  natural  colour,  which  is 
not  of  itself  very  conspicuous,  and  besides  this  certain  reflected  lights, 


942  LANDSCAPE 

which,  owing  to  their  not  being  against  a  background  that  offers  a 
strong  contrast  to  their  brightness,  are  but  little  in  evidence;  and  if  you 
are  at  a  lower  altitude  than  these,  such  parts  of  them  may  be  visible  as 
are  not  exposed  to  the  sun,  and  these  will  be  dark. 


IN  THE  WIND 

But  if  you  are  on  the  side  from  whence  the  wind  is  blowing,  you  will 
see  the  trees  looking  much  lighter  than  you  would  see  them  from  the 
other  sides;  and  this  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  wind  turns  up  the  reverse 
sides  of  the  leaves,  which  are  in  all  cases  much  paler  than  their  right 
sides;  and  especially  will  they  be  very  light  if  the  wind  blows  from  the 
quarter  where  the  sun  happens  to  be,  and  if  you  have  your  back  turned 
to  it.  b.m.  113  v. 

All  trees  seen  against  the  sun  are  dark  towards  the  centre;  this  dark- 
ness will  take  the  shape  of  the  tree  when  it  stands  apart  from  others. 

The  shadows  cast  by  trees  on  which  the  sun  is  shining  are  as  dark 
as  that  of  the  centre  of  the  tree. 

The  shadow  cast  by  trees  is  never  less  in  mass  than  the  mass  of  the 
tree;  but  it  is  larger  in  proportion  as  the  place  where  it  is  thrown  slopes 
more  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth. 

A  shadow  will  be  thickest  towards  the  centre  of  a  tree  when  it  has 
fewest  branches. 

Every  branch  gets  the  middle  of  the  shadow  of  every  other  branch 
and  as  a  consequence  of  all  the  tree. 

The  shape  of  every  shadow  of  branch  or  tree  is  clothed  with  a  bright 
part  on  the  side  from  which  the  light  comes;  this  brightness  will  be  of 
the  same  shape  as  the  shadow  and  may  extend  for  a  mile  from  the  side 
where  the  sun  is. 

If  it  should  happen  anywhere  that  a  cloud  casts  a  shadow  on  some 
part  of  the  hills,  the  trees  there  will  undergo  less  change  than  in  the 
distances  or  plains;  for  the  trees  upon  the  hills  have  their  branches 
thicker  because  their  growth  each  year  is  less  than  in  the  plains;  there- 
fore as  they  are  of  the  number  of  those  naturally  dark  and  full  of  shade 
the  shadows  of  the  clouds  cannot  make  them  any  darker,  and  the  level 
spaces  that  come  between  the  trees  which  have  not  lost  any  shadow 


LANDSCAPE  943 

vary  very  much  in  tone,  and  especially  those  which  arc  other  than 
green,  such  as  cultivated  lands  or  the  havoc  of  mountains  or  their 
barrenness  or  ruggedness. 

Where  trees  are  on  the  skyline  they  seem  of  the  same  colour,  unless 
they  are  very  close  together  and  with  thick-set  leaves  like  the  pine  and 
similar  trees. 

When  you  see  trees  on  the  side  on  which  the  sun  lights  them  you 
will  see  them  of  almost  uniform  brightness,  and  the  shadows  which  are 
within  them  will  be  covered  by  the  illuminated  leaves  which  come 
between  your  eye  and  the  shadows. 

When  trees  come  between  the  sun  and  the  eye  beyond  the  shadows 
which  spread  out  from  their  centre  you  will  see  the  green  of  the  leaves 
in  transparence;  but  this  transparence  will  be  broken  in  many  places 
by  the  leaves  and  branches  in  shadow  which  come  between  you  and 
them,  and  in  the  upper  portions  it  will  be  accompanied  by  many 
reflections  from  the  leaves.  b.m.  114  r. 

When  the  sun  is  covered  by  clouds,  objects  have  a  low  degree  of 
visibility;  because  there  is  but  little  difference  between  the  lights  and 
shadows  of  the  trees  and  buildings,  through  them  being  illuminated 
by  the  spaciousness  of  the  atmosphere,  which  surrounds  the  objects  in 
such  a  way  that  the  shadows  are  few,  and  these  few  become  fainter  and 
fainter  so  that  their  extremities  become  lost  in  mist. 

The  trees  in  landscapes  are  of  various  different  shades  of  green;  for 
in  some,  such  as  firs,  pines,  cypresses,  laurels,  box  and  the  like,  it  bor- 
ders on  black;  others  such  as  walnuts  and  pears,  vines  and  young  foli- 
age approximate  to  yellow;  others  to  darker  shades  of  yellow,  such  as 
chestnuts,  oaks  and  the  like,  others  redden  towards  the  autumn,  these 
are  sorbs,  pomegranates,  vines  and  cherry  trees;  others  such  as  willows, 
olives,  bamboos,  and  others  like  these,  tend  to  become  white.

in  the  current  of  the  winds;  and  here  their  perspective  is  inverted,  for 
if  the  tree  is  between  you  and  the  quarter  from  which  the  wind  is 
coming,  the  tips  of  the  leaves  which  are  towards  you  take  their  natural 
position,  and  those  opposite  which  should  have  their  tips  the  contrary 
way,  from  the  fact  of  their  being  upside  down,  will  be  turned  with  their 
tips  towards  you. 

Trees  in  a  landscape  do  not  stand  out  distinctly  one  from  another, 
because  their  illuminated  parts  border  on  the  illuminated  parts  of  those 
beyond  them,  and  so  there  is  little  difference  between  the  lights  and 
the  shadows. 

When  clouds  come  between  the  sun  and  the  eye  all  the  edges  of  their 
rounded  masses  are  clear,  and  they  are  dark  towards  the  centre,  and  this 
happens  because  towards  the  top  these  edges  are  seen  by  the  sun  from 
above  while  you  are  looking  at  them  from  below;  and  the  same  hap- 
pens with  the  positions  of  the  branches  of  the  trees;  and  moreover  the 
clouds,  like  the  trees,  through  being  somewhat  transparent  are  partly 
bright,  and  at  the  edges  show  themselves  thinner. 

But  when  the  eye  finds  itself  between  the  cloud  and  the  sun,  the 
appearance  of  the  cloud  is  the  contrary  of  what  it  was  before,  for  the 
edges  of  its  rounded  masses  are  dark  and  they  are  bright  towards  the 
centre.  And  this  comes  about  because  you  are  looking  at  that  part 
which  is  also  facing  the  sun,  and  because  these  edges  have  a  degree  of 
transparency  and  reveal  to  the  eye  the  part  that  is  hidden  beyond  them, 
and  this  not  being  visible  to  the  sun  as  are  the  parts  which  are  turned 
towards  it  is  necessarily  somewhat  darker.  It  may  also  be  that  you  see 
the  details  of  these  rounded  masses  from  the  underside  while  the  sun 
sees  it  from  above,  and  since  they  are  not  so  situated  as  to  give  back  the 
brightness  of  the  sun  as  in  the  former  instance,  therefore  they  remain 
dark. 

The  black  clouds  which  are  often  visible  above  those  that  are  bright 
and  illuminated  by  the  sun,  are  thrown  into  shadow  by  the  other  clouds 
which  are  interposed  between  them  and  the  sun. 

Again  the  rounded  masses  of  the  clouds  that  face  the  sun  show  their 
edges  dark,  because  they  are  silhouetted  1  against  a  bright  background; 
and  to  see  the  truth  of  this  you  should  observe  the  top  of  a  cloud  which

is  entirely  light  because  it  is  silhouetted  against  the  blue  of  the  atmos- 
phere whieh  is  darker  than  the  cloud.  b.m.  172  v. 

OF  MOVEMENT 

I  ask  whether  the  true  movement  of  the  clouds  can  be  recognised  by 
the  movement  of  their  shadows,  and  similarly  by  the  movement  of  the 
sun.  Forster  11  46  r. 

The  sun  will  appear  greater  in  moving  water  or  when  the  surface  is 
broken  into  waves  than  it  does  in  still  water.  An  example  is  of  the  light 
reflected  on  the  strings  of  the  monochord.    Windsor:  Drawings  12350 

OF  CLOUDS  SMOKE  AND  DUST  AND  FLAMES  FROM  AN  OVEN 
OR  BURNING  KILN 

The  clouds  do  not  display  their  roundnesses  except  in  those  parts 
which  are  seen  by  the  sun :  other  roundnesses  are  imperceptible  because 
they  are  in  the  parts  in  shadow. 

If  the  sun  is  in  the  east  and  the  clouds  are  in  the  west,  the  position 
of  the  eye  being  between  the  sun  and  the  cloud,  it  sees  the  edges  of  the 
roundnesses  which  are  the  component  parts  of  these  clouds  as  dark, 
and  the  portions  which  are  surrounded  by  these  darknesses  become 
light.  And  this  proceeds  from  the  fact  that  the  edges  of  the  rounded 
forms  of  these  clouds  face  the  sky  above  and  around  them,  so  that  it  is 
mirrored  in  them. 

The  cloud  and  the  tree  display  no  roundness  in  those  of  their  parts 
which  are  in  shadow.  Windsor:  Drawings  12388 

The  shadows  of  clouds  are  lighter  in  proportion  as  they  are  nearer 
to  the  horizon.  Windsor:  Drawings  12391 

That  part  of  a  tree  which  is  against  a  background  of  shadow  is  al] 
of  one  tone,  and  where  the  trees  or  branches  are  thickest  there  it  is 
darkest  because  there  is  less  perforation  by  the  air.  But  where  the 
branches  are  on  a  background  of  other  branches  there  the  luminous 
parts  show  themselves  brighter  and  the  leaves  more  resplendent, 
because  of  the  sun  which  illumines  them.

Light  and  Shade 

'No  substance  can  be  comprehended  without  light 
and  shade;  light  and  shade  are  caused  by  light! 

That  place  is  most  shaded  on  which  the  greatest  number  of  shaded 
rays  converge. 

That  place  which  is  smitten  by  the  shaded  rays  at  the  greatest  angle 
is  darkest. 

That  place  will  be  most  luminous  from  which  the  greatest  number 
of  luminous  rays  are  reflected.  c.a.  31  v.  b 

Light  is  the  expeller  of  darkness.  Shadow  is  the  suppression  of  light. 

Primary  light  is  that  which  is  the  cause  of  the  lighting  of  shaded 
bodies. 

And  the  derived  lights  are  those  parts  of  bodies  which  are  illumined 
by  the  primary  light. 

Primary  shadow  is  that  side  of  a  body  on  which  the  light  does  not 
fall. 

Derived  shadow  is  simply  the  striking  of  shaded  rays. 

Each  body  which  creates  a  concourse  of  rays  fills  the  surrounding 
air  with  an  infinite  number  of  its  images. 

A  shaded  and  luminous  concourse  is  that  mass  of  rays  which  emanate 
from  a  shaded  and  luminous  body  running  through  the  air  without 
striking. 

Shaded  or  luminous  percussion  is  that  which  impedes  and  cuts  above 
itself  the  concourse  of  shaded  and  luminous  rays.  c.a.  116  r.  b 

The  shadow  in  diaphanous  and  spherical  bodies  is  darker  at  the  top 
than  in  the  hollow,  and  darker  amid  the  darkness  of  the  derived 
shadow  of  the  body  of  the  ball. 

Every  object  seen  is  surrounded  by  second  objects,  and  from  this  it 

947 


948  LIGHT  AND  SHADE 

is  known:  and  in  proportion  as  the  second  object  is  farther  away  than 
the  first  so  much  the  more  does  the  first  cover  it  from  the  eye. 

c.a.  125  r.  b 

Among  the  things  of  equal  obscurity  which  are  situated  at  a  con- 
siderable and  equal  distance,  that  will  appear  more  obscure  which  has 
its  station  higher  up  from  the  earth. 

The  edges  of  a  derived  shadow  will  be  most  distinct  where  it  is  cast 
nearest  to  the  original  shadow. 

A  shaded  body  will  appear  of  less  size  when  it  is  surrounded  by  a 
very  luminous  background,  and  a  luminous  body  will  show  itself 
greater  when  it  is  set  against  a  darker  background:  as  is  shown* in  the 
heights  of  buildings  at  night  when  there  are  flashes  of  lightning  behind 
them.  For  it  instantly  appears,  as  the  lightning  flashes,  that  the  building 
loses  a  part  of  its  height. 

And  from  this  it  comes  to  pass  that  these  buildings  appear  larger 
when  there  is  mist,  or  by  night,  than  when  the  air  is  clear  and 
illumined.  c.a.  126  r.  b 

The  breadth  and  length  of  shadow  and  of  light,  although  through 
foreshortening  it  may  appear  less  in  quantity,  will  not  therefore  appear 
diminished  as  to  quality  either  in  respect  of  brightness  or  darkness. 

c.a.  144  v.  a 

All  the  illuminated  parts  of  a  body  which  see  the  whole  circle  of  the 
luminous  body  will  be  the  more  dissimilar  in  brightness,  one  from 
another,  as  they  are  nearer  to  the  source  of  the  light,      c.a.  150  r.  a 

The  atmosphere  is  of  itself  adapted  to  gather  up  instantaneously  and 
to  leave  behind  it  every  image  and  likeness  of  whatever  body  it  sees. 

When  the  sun  appears  in  the  eastern  horizon  it  permeates  at  once  the 
whole  of  our  hemisphere  and  fills  it  with  its  luminous  semblance. 

All  the  surfaces  of  solid  bodies  turned  towards  the  sun  or  towards 
the  atmosphere  illumined  by  the  sun,  become  clothed  and  dyed  by  the 
light  of  the  atmosphere  or  of  the  sun. 

Every  solid  body  is  surrounded  and  clothed  with  light  and  darkness. 

You  will  get  only  a  poor  perception  of  the  detail  of  a  body  when  the 
part  visible  is  all  the  part  in  shadow,  or  only  the  part  that  is  illumined. 

The  length  of  the  space  which  exists  between  the  eye  and  the  solid 


LIGHT  AND  SHADE  949 

bodies  determines  how  much  the  part  that  is  illumined  increases,  and 
that  in  shadow  diminishes. 

The  shape  of  a  body  cannot  be  accurately  perceived  when  its 
extremities  are  bounded  by  something  of  the  same  colour  as  itself, 
and  the  eye  is  between  the  part  in  shadow  and  that  in  light. 

c.a.  179  r.  b 

No  separated  shadow  can  reproduce  upon  a  wall  the  true  form  of 
the  body  of  which  it  is  the  shadow,  unless  the  centre  of  the  light  is 
equidistant  from  the  extremities  of  this  body.  c.a.  187  v.  a 

I  Camera  Obscura] 

The  boundaries  of  the  images  of  any  colour  which  penetrate  through 
a  narrow  hole  into  a  dark  place  will  be  always  of  a  more  powerful 
colour  than  its  centre.  c.a.  190  r.  b 

Why  black  painted  in  juxtaposition  with  white  never  seems  to  show 
itself  more  black  than  where  it  borders  upon  black,  and  white  does  not 
show  itself  more  white  in  juxtaposition  with  black  than  with  white;  as 
is  seen  with  the  images  passed  through  a  hole  or  at  the  edge  of  any 
dark  obstacle. 

This  comes  about  because  the  images  tinge  with  their  colour  the 
spot  on  which  they  fall,  and  when  the  different  images  approach  the 
same  spot  they  make  a  blend  of  their  colours,  and  this  blend  participates 
more  in  one  colour  than  in  another  as  the  one  colour  is  present  in 
greater  quantity  than  the  other. 

And  the  colours  are  more  intense  and  more  sharply  defined  at  their 
edges  than  in  any  other  part.  c.a.  195  v. 

OF  THE  DARKNESS  OF  THE  SHADOWS  OR  YOU  MAY 
SAY  THE  BRIGHTNESS  OF  THE  LIGHTS 

Those  who  have  experience  use  in  all  intricate  things  such  as  trees, 
meadows,  hair,  beards  and  fur,  four  stages  of  clearness  in  order  to 
reproduce  the  same  colour;  that  is,  first  a  dark  foundation,  second  a 
blur  which  has  something  of  the  shape  of  the  part,  third  a  clearer  and 
more  defined  part,  fourth  the  lights  more  in  high  parts  for  movements 
of  the  figure  [  ?  ] ; x  it  seems  however  to  me  that  these  varieties  are 

1  MS.,  ilumi  piii  che  alte  parte  moti  di  figura

infinite  in  the  case  of  a  continuous  quantity,  which  is  in  itself  divisible 
to  infinity,  and  thus  I  prove  it: 
|  Two  diagrams} 

Let  a  g  be  a  continuous  quantity  and  d  the  light  that  illumines  it. 
I  refer  now  to  the  fourth  which  says  that  that  part  of  the  illuminated 
body  will  be  more  luminous  which  is  nearer  to  the  source  of  its  illumi- 
nation; g  therefore  is  darker  than  c  in  proportion  as  the  line  d  g  is 
longer  than  the  line  d  c.  And  from  the  conclusion  that  such  grades  of 
brightness,  or  if  you  so  prefer  of  darkness,  are  not  four  only,  but  may 
be  conceived  of  as  infinite,  because  c  d  is  a  continuous  quantity,  and 
every  continuous  quantity  is  divisible  to  infinity,  therefore  the  variety 
in  the  length  of  the  lines  that  extend  from  the  luminous  to  the  illumi- 
nated body  is  infinite;  and  the  proportion  of  the  lights  corresponds 
to  the  lengths  of  the  lines  between  them,  which  extend  from  the  centre 
of  the  luminous  body  to  the  part  of  the  object  which  is  illuminated  by  it.

THE  ACTION  OF  LIGHT  FROM  ITS  CENTRE 

If  the  whole  light  were  what  caused  the  shadows  behind  the  bodies 
placed  against  it,  it  would  be  necessary  that  that  body,  which  is  much 
less  than  the  light,  should  have  a  pyramidal  shadow  behind  itself,  and 
as  experience  does  not  confirm  this,  it  must  be  that  it  is  the  centre  of 
the  light  which  performs  this  function. 

HOW  NO  SPHERICAL  BODY  CAN  CONTINUALLY  REVOLVE 

AS  IT  MOVES 

The  cannon-ball  from  the  mortar,  if  it  be  of  uniform  substance,  and 
its  surface  be  equidistant  from  its  centre,  and  the  fire  strikes  it  in  the 
middle,  as  reason  would  suggest,  must  needs  take  its  course  without 
any  revolution.  Seeing  that  the  fire  that  expels  it  is  of  uniform  nature, 
it  drives  equally  the  air  which  withstands  its  course,  and  as  this  also  is 
equal  it  offers  equal  resistance. 

Example 

Thus  for  example,  one  sees  the  moon,  which  is  also  a  spherical  body 
and  meets  with  equal  resistance,  to  be  much  swifter  as  compared  with 


LIGHT  AND  SHADE  951 

the  cannon-ball,  but  nevertheless  the  dark  spots  that  are  on  it  never 
change  their  position,  and  the  fact  of  this  change  not  appearing,  clearly 
confirms  the  fact  that  it  does  not  revolve. 

A  PROOF  HOW  OBJECTS  COME  TO  THE  EYE 

If  you  look  at  the  sun  or  other  luminous  object  and  then  shut  your 
eyes,  you  will  see  it  again  in  the  same  form  within  your  eye  for  a  long 
space  of  time:  this  is  a  sign  that  the  images  enter  within  it. 

c.a.  204  r.  a 

When  the  intersection  of  two  columns  of  shadow  produces  their 
derived  shadows  by  means  of  the  two  luminous  ones,  it  must  follow 
that  four  derived  shadows  are  produced,  and  these  shadows  are  com- 
posite, and  they  intersect  at  four  places;  and  of  these  intersections  there 
are  two  that  form  simple  shadow,  and  two  are  of  composite  shadow, 
and  these  two  simple  shadows  are  produced  where  the  two  lights 
cannot  be  seen,  and  the  composite  shadows  are  produced  where  one  of 
the  two  lights  cannot  illumine.  But  the  intersections  of  the  composite 
shadows  are  produced  always  by  a  single  luminous  body,  and  of  the 
simple  ones  by  two  luminous  bodies,  and  the  right  intersection  of  the 
composite  shadow  is  produced  by  the  left  light,  and  the  left  intersection 
is  produced  by  the  right  light;  but  the  two  intersections  of  the  simple 
shadows,  both  the  upper  and  the  lower,  are  produced  by  the  two  lumi- 
nous bodies,  that  is  the  light  on  the  right  and  the  light  on  the  left.

THE  NATURE  OF  THE  LIGHT  THAT  PENETRATES  THE 

VENT  HOLES 

With  reference  to  the  light  that  penetrates  the  vent  holes,  it  may  be. 
doubted  whether  it  reconstitutes  with  the  dilatation  of  its  rays  as  much 
breadth  of  impression  beyond  the  vent  hole  as  the  width  of  the  body 
which  is  the  cause  of  the  rays. 


952  LIGHT  AND  SHADE 

And  in  addition  to  this,  whether  this  dilatation  has  a  power  equal  to 
that  of  the  luminous  body.  As  regards  the  first  doubt  the  reply  is  that 
the  dilatation  made  by  the  rays  after  their  intersection  recreates  as  much 
breadth  beyond  the  vent  hole  as  in  front  of  the  vent  hole,  there  being 
as  much  space  from  the  luminous  body  to  the  vent  hole  as  from  the 
vent  hole  to  the  impress  of  its  rays;  this  is  proved  by  the  straightness 
of  the  luminous  rays,  from  which  it  follows  that  there  is  the  same 
proportion  between  their  breadth  and  between  the  distances  at  which 
they  intersect. 

But  power  does  not  proceed  in  the  same  proportion;  as  is  proved 
where  it  is  stated:  just  such  proportion  exists  between  the  heat  and  the 
radiance  in  the  different  luminous  rays  as  between  their  distances  from 
their  source.  It  is  proved  therefore  that  the  luminous  ray  loses  in  heat 
and  radiance  in  proportion  as  it  is  more  remote  from  its  luminous 
body.  It  is  true  however  that  the  composite  shadows,  being  derived, 
and  starting  from  the  edges  of  these  vent  holes,  break  this  rule  by 
means  of  their  intersections;  and  this  is  treated  of  fully  in  the  second 
book  concerning  shadow.  c.a.  241  r.  d 

The  rays  of  the  shaded  and  luminous  images  intersect  after  they  have 
penetrated  within  the  vent  holes,  turning  in  opposite  directions  every 
part  of  their  thickness.  c.a.  241  v.  c 

The  shadow  will  never  show  itself  of  uniform  density  in  the  place  of 
its  incidence,  unless  this  place  be  equidistant  from  the  luminous  body. 
This  is  proved  by  the  seventh  which  says :  that  shadow  will  show  itself 
lighter  or  darker  which  is  against  a  darker  or  lighter  background;  by 
the  eighth  of  this :  that  background  will  have  its  parts  so  much  darker 
or  lighter  as  it  is  more  remote  from  or  nearer  to  the  luminous  body; 
and  among  the  positions  at  an  equal  distance  from  the  luminous  body 
that  will  show  itself  more  illuminated  which  receives  the  luminous 
rays  at  more  equal  angles.  No  matter  with  what  inequality  of  position  a 
shadow  is  defined,  it  will  always  show  itself  with  its  true  boundaries 
equal  to  the  shaded  body  if  the  eye  rests  upon  the  centre  of  the  lumi- 
nous body. 

That  shadow  will  show  itself  darker  that  is  more  remote  from  its 
shaded  body.  c.a.  241  v.  d 


LIGHT  AND  SHADE  953 

The  image  of  the  sun  is  all  in  all  the  parts  of  the  objects  upon  which 
its  rays  fall,  and  all  in  each  particular  part. 

Why  in  the  far  distance  a  radiance  which  is  long  will  appear  round 
to  us,  and  the  horns  of  the  moon  do  not  follow  this  rule,  and  yet  the 
light  near  by  follows  as  its  point  indicates.  c.a.  243  r.  a 


PROEM 

Having,  as  I  think,  sufficiently  treated  of  the  natures  and  different 
characteristics  of  primary  and  derived  shadows,  and  the  manner  of 
their  incidence,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  time  has  now  come  to  explain 
the  different  results  upon  the  various  surfaces  which  are  touched  by 
these  shadows. 


SHADOW  IS  THE  WITHHOLDING  OF  LIGHT 

It  seems  to  me  that  the  shadows  are  of  supreme  importance  in 
perspective,  seeing  that  without  them  opaque  and  solid  bodies  will  be 
indistinct,  both  as  to  what  lies  within  their  boundaries  and  also  as  to 
their  boundaries  themselves,  unless  these  are  seen  against  a  background 
differing  in  colour  from  that  of  the  substance;  and  consequently  in  the 
first  proposition  I  treat  of  shadows,  and  say  in  this  connection  that 
every  opaque  body  is  surrounded  and  has  its  surface  clothed  with 
shadows  and  lights,  and  to  this  I  devote  the  first  book.  Moreover  these 
shadows  are  in  themselves  of  varying  degrees  of  darkness,  because  they 
have  been  abandoned  by  a  varying  quantity  of  luminous  rays;  and 
these  I  call  primary  shadows,  because  they  are  the  first  shadows  and  so 
form  a  covering  to  the  bodies  to  which  they  attach  themselves,  and  to 
this  I  shall  devote  the  second  book.  From  these  primary  shadows  there 
issue  certain  dark  rays,  which  are  diffused  throughout  the  air  and  vary 
in  intensity  according  to  the  varieties  of  the  primary  shadows  from 
which  they  are  derived;  and  consequently  I  call  these  shadows  derived 
shadows,  because  they  have  their  origin  in  other  shadows;  and  of  this 
I  will  make  the  third  book.  Moreover  these  derived  shadows  in  striking 
upon  anything  create  as  many  different  effects  as  are  the  different 
places  where  they  strike;  and  of  this  I  will  make  the  fourth  book.  And 
since  where  the  derived  shadow  strikes,  it  is  always  surrounded  by  the 


954  LIGHT  AND  SHADE 

striking  of  the  luminous  rays,  it  leaps  back  with  these  in  a  reflex  stream 
towards  its  source  and  meets  the  primary  shadow,  and  mingles  with 
and  becomes  changed  into  it,  altering  thereby  somewhat  of  its  nature; 
and  to  this  I  will  devote  the  fifth  book.  In  addition  to  this  I  will  make 
the  sixth  book  to  contain  an  investigation  of  the  many  different  varieties 
of  the  rebound  of  the  reflected  rays,  which  will  modify  the  primary 
shadow  by  as  many  different  colours  as  there  are  different  points  from 
whence  these  luminous  reflected  rays  proceed.  Further  I  will  make  the 
seventh  division  treat  of  the  various  distances  that  may  exist  between 
the  point  of  striking  of  each  reflected  ray  and  the  point  from  whence 
it  proceeds,  and  of  the  various  different  shades  of  colour  which  it 
acquires  in  striking  against  opaque  bodies.  c.a.  250  r.  a 

In  proportion  as  the  luminous  body  is  nearer  to  the  shaded  body,  it 
throws  out  more  light  if  the  luminous  body  is  greater  than  the  dark 
body. 

In  proportion  as  the  luminous  body  is  more  distant  from  the  shaded 
body  and  is  less  than  it,  it  will  give  more  light. 

But  in  proportion  as  the  luminous  body  being  less  than  the  shaded 
body  is  more  distant  from  this  shaded  body  it  will  give  more  light. 

And  if  the  luminous  body  being  greater  than  the  shaded  body  is 
moved  farther  away  from  the  shaded  body,  the  total  amount  that  is 
illuminated  will  continue  to  diminish  until  it  is  approximately  half. 

c.a.  250  v.  a 

THE  ACTION  OF  COMPOUND  SHADOW 

The  actions  of  compound  shadows  are  always  made  up  of  contrary 
movements.  That  is,  that  if  the  concourse  of  luminous  rays  before 
arriving  at  their  point  of  intersection  be  touched  by  an  opaque  body, 
all  the  shadows  of  that  body  which  break  in  upon  the  upper  ray  will 
show  themselves  beyond  this  point  of  intersection  in  the  percussion  of 
the  lower  ray,  and  as  the  upper  ray  becomes  the  lower  after  the  inter- 
section, so  the  movements  which  the  shaded  body  makes  within  this 
upper  ray  will  show  themselves  of  contrary  movement  after  this  inter- 
section; and  this  will  reveal  itself  in  the  incidence  of  the  compound 
shadow  upon  the  pavement,  or  on  a  wall  that  is  struck  by  the  sun  or 
other  luminous  body. 


LIGHT  AND  SHADE  955 

But  if  the  Luminous  ray  is  interrupted  by  the  opaque  body  some 
distance  from  its  intersection,  the  percussion  of  the  derived  shadow  of 
the  opaque  body  will  make  a  movement  similar  to  that  of  the  opaque 
body. 

And  if  these  rays  are  interrupted  at  the  actual  point  of  their  inter- 
section, then  the  shadows  of  the  opaque  body  will  be  twofold,  and  they 
will  move  with  contrary  movements  one  to  another  before  they  reach 
the  point  of  union. 

The  derived  compound  shadow  is  the  cause  why  the  percussion  of 
the  solar  ray  when  passing  through  any  kind  of  angle  does  not  leave  its 
impression  on  this  angle;  but  portions  of  ...  so  much  greater  or  less 
...  in  proportion  as  these  impressions  are  more  remote  from  or  nearer 
to  these  angles.  c.a.  277  v.  a 

The  site  that  is  most  luminous  will  vary  according  to  the  different 
positions  of  the  eye  and  the  light;  and  the  shadow  will  always  be  im- 
movable, for  whatever  the  change  it  makes,  the  eye  sees  it. 

c.a.  322  v.  b 

No  opaque  body  can  be  visible  unless  it  is  clothed  with  a  shaded  and 
illuminated  surface. 

The  air  and  every  transparent  body  becomes  a  passage  from  the 
objects  to  the  eye  for  the  images  of  those  bodies  which  find  themselves 
either  within  or  beyond  them. 

Derived  light  should  be  surrounded  by  primitive  shadow. 

Derived  shadow  will  be  surrounded  by  derived  light. 

Derived  light  should  be  surrounded,  in  whole  or  in  part,  by  primitive 
or  derived  shadows. 

Every  opaque  body  has  its  image  all  in  all  and  all  in  every  part  of 
the  transparence  that  surrounds  it.  c.a.  349  v.  d 

OF  PAINTING

How  lights  ought  to  be  so  rendered  that  they  draw  natural  things. 

How  natural  figures  when  they  have  intense  light  on  one  side  seem

How  men  show  a  small  variation  from  light  to  shadow  when  the 
atmosphere  is  overcast  or  the  sun  is  on  the  point  of  setting. 

For  what  reason  objects  as  they  recede  from  the  eye  are  perceived 
poorly  and  seem  to  lose  clearness  of  outline,  and  in  the  far  distance

Primary  and  derived  shadow  are  deeper  when  they  are  caused  by 
the  light  of  the  candle  than  by  that  of  the  atmosphere. 

The  more  the  derived  shadow  which  is  greater  enters  in  the  less,  the 
more  the  cause  of  the  less  is  more  luminous  than  the  greater.

At  the  window  a  h  the  sun  enters  into  the  house;  this  sun  will 
increase  the  size  of  the  window  and  lessen  the  shadow  of  a  man,  with 
the  result  that  when  the  said  man  shall  approach  this  shadow  of  him- 
self, lost  in  that  which  carries  the  true  shape  of  the  window,  he  will  see 
the  contact  of  the  shadows  lost  and  confused  by  the  power  of  the  light, 
close  themselves  up  and  not  suffer  the  solar  rays  to  pass  .  .  .

That  part  of  a  shaded  body  which  is  illuminated  will  transmit  to  the

Among  bodies  equal  in  size  and  distance  that  which  shines  the  more

The  straight  edges  of  bodies  will  appear  broken  when  they  serve  as 
boundary  of  a  dark  space  streaked  by  the  percussion  of  luminous  rays. 

c  1  v. 

The  body  illuminated  by  the  solar  rays  which  have  passed  through 
the  thick  branches  of  the  trees,  will  cast  as  many  shadows  as  is  the 
number  of  the  branches  interposed  between  the  sun  and  itself. 

The  shaded  rays  which  proceed  from  a  pyramidal  shaded  body  will 
bifurcate  when  they  intersect,  and  the  shadow  will  be  of  varying  de- 
grees of  depth  at  its  points. 

A  light  which  is  greater  than  the  point  and  less  than  the  base  of  the 
shaded  pyramidal  body  placed  in  front  of  it,  will  cause  the  shaded  body 
to  produce  at  its  percussion  a  bifurcated  shadow  of  varying  degrees  of 
depth. 

If  a  shaded  body  being  smaller  than  a  luminous  body  casts  two 
shadows,  and  a  shaded  body  the  same  size  as  a  luminous  body  or  greater 
than  it  casts  one,  it  follows  that  the  pyramidal  body  of  which  part  is 
smaller  than,  part  equal  to,  and  part  larger  than  the  luminous  body, 
will  cast  a  bifurcated  shadow.  c  2  r. 

The  body  that  receives  the  solar  rays  which  have  passed  between  the 
minute  ramifications  of  trees  at  a  great  distance  will  have  but  a  single 
shadow. 

If  the  body,  part  in  shadow  and  part  in  light,  be  of  the  shape  of  a  per- 
fect sphere,  the  base  of  the  luminous  pyramid  will  bear  the  same  pro- 


958  LIGHT  AND  SHADE 

portion  to  its  body  as  that  which  the  base  of  the  shaded  pyramid  bears 
to  the  shaded  body. 

In  proportion  as  the  percussion  made  by  the  convergence  of  the 
shadow  on  the  opposite  wall  is  more  distant  from  the  luminous  body 
and  nearer  the  source  from  which  it  is  derived,  so  much  the  darker  and 
of  more  defined  contours  will  it  appear.  c  2  v. 

That  luminous  body  will  appear  of  less  radiance  which  is  surrounded 
by  a  more  luminous  background: 

I  have  found  that  those  stars  that  are  nearest  the  horizon  appear 
larger  in  form  than  the  others,  because  they  see  and  are  seen  by  a 
greater  amount  of  the  solar  body  than  when  they  are  above  us;  and 
since  they  see  more  of  the  sun  they  have  a  greater  light.  And  the  body 
that  is  most  luminous  shows  itself  of  greater  form,  as  the  sun  shows 
itself  in  the  mist  above  us,  for  it  seems  larger  when  it  is  without  mist 
and  with  the  mist  it  diminishes. 

No  part  of  the  luminous  body  is  ever  visible  from  the  pyramid  of 
pure  derived  shadow.  c  3  r. 

[Movement  of  shadows] 

If  the  object  is  moved  slowly  before  the  luminous  body  and  the  per- 
cussion of  the  shadow  of  this  object  is  remote  from  its  object,  the  move- 
ment of  the  derived  shadow  will  have  the  same  proportion  with  the 
movement  of  the  primary,  as  the  space  between  the  object  and  the  light 
has  with  that  between  the  object  and  the  percussion  of  the  shadow, — so 
that  when  the  object  moves  slowly  the  shadow  is  rapid.  c  3  v. 

That  part  of  the  reflection  will  be  brightest  in  which  the  reflected 
rays  are  shortest. 

The  darkness  caused  by  a  number  of  shadows  intersecting  will  be  in 
conformity  with  their  cause,  which  has  its  beginning  and  end  between 
smooth  surfaces  near  to  each  other,  of  the  same  quality  and  directly 
opposite  to  each  other. 

In  proportion  as  the  luminous  body  is  greater  the  course  of  the 
luminous  and  shadow  rays  will  be  more  mingled  together. 

This  comes  about  because  where  the  larger  number  of  luminous  rays 
are  found,  there  is  most  light,  and  where  a  lesser  number,  less  light, 
from  which  it  comes  about  that  the  shadow  rays  enter  and  mingle  with 
them.  c  4  r. 


LIGHT   AND   SHADE  959 

That  part  of  the  surface  of  bodies  on  which  the  images  of  the  bodies 
placed  opposite,  fall  at  the  largest  angle  will  be  tinged  most  with  their 
colour. 

The  most  luminous  part  of  the  illuminated  body  which  encompasses 
the  percussion  of  the  shadow  will  be  that  which'  is  nearest  to  this  per- 
cussion. 

Just  as  a  thing  touched  by  a  greater  mass  of  luminous  rays  becomes 
brighter,  so  that  will  become  darker  which  is  struck  by  a  greater  mass 
of  shadow  rays.  c  4  v. 

A  luminous  body  will  seem  more  brilliant  when  it  is  surrounded  by 
deeper  shadow. 

The  breadth  and  length  of  shadow  and  light,  although  through  fore- 
shortening they  become  straighter  and  shorter,  will  neither  diminish  nor 
increase  the  quality  or  quantity  of  their  brightness  or  darkness. 

The  function  of  shadow  and  of  light  diminished  by  foreshortening, 
will  be  to  shade  and  illumine  an  object  opposite  to  it,  according  to  the 
quality  and  quantity  that  appear  in  this  object. 

The  more  a  derived  shadow  approaches  its  penultimate  extremities 
the  deeper  it  will  appear.  c  5  r. 

Perspective 

If  you  cause  the  rays  of  the  sun  to  pass  through  a  small  hole  of  the 
shape  of  a  star  you  will  see  beautiful  effects  of  perspective  in  the  per- 
cussion caused  by  the  passage  of  the  sun.  c  7  r. 

SHADOW  AND  LIGHT 

The  forms  of  shadows  are  three :  for  if  the  substance  which  casts  the 
shadow  is  equal  in  size  to  the  light,  the  shadow  is  like  a  column  which 
has  no  end;  if  the  substance  is  greater  than  the  light,  its  shadow  is  like 
a  pyramid  which  grows  larger  as  it  recedes  and  of  which  the  length  has 
no  end;  but  if  the  substance  is  smaller  than  the  light  the  shadow 
resembles  a  pyramid  and  comes  to  an  end,  as  is  seen  in  the  eclipses  of 
the  moon.  07  V. 


960  LIGHT  AND   SHADE 

OF  LIGHT 

The  shape  of  a  luminous  body  although  it  has  length  will  at  a  great 
distance  seem  round. 

This  is  shown  by  the  flame  of  the  candle,  which  although  it  is  long 
seems  round  at  a  great  distance;  and  the  same  thing  may  happen  with 
the  stars,  for  even  if  they  were  horned  like  the  moon  they  would  seem 
round  by  reason  of  their  great  distance.  c  8  r. 

Among  bodies  equal  in  size  and  length  and  equal  also  in  form  and 
depth  of  shade,  that  will  appear  the  smaller  which  is  surrounded  by  a 
more  luminous  background. 

A  shaded  body  placed  between  equal  lights  will  cast  as  many  shadows 
as  there  are  lights,  shadows  of  which  one  will  be  darker  than  the  others 
as  the  light  situated  on  the  opposite  side  is  nearer  this  body  than  the 
others. 

A  shaded  body  equidistant  between  two  lights  will  cast  two  shadows, 
one  darker  than  the  other  in  proportion  as  one  of  the  lights  which  cause 
them  is  greater  than  the  other.  c  8  v. 

The  places  occupied  by  the  shadows  caused  by  a  small  luminous  body 
are,  as  regards  size,  similar  and  corresponding  to  those  of  which  the 
visual  rays  are  cut  ofT. 

And  when  the  luminous  ray  has  passed  through  a  small  hole  and 
been  broken  upon  some  opposing  object  near  at  hand,  the  impress  of  its 
percussion  resembles  more  the  hole  through  which  it  has  passed  than 
the  luminous  body  from  which  it  proceeds.  c  9  r. 

The  greater  the  radiance  of  the  luminous  body  the  deeper  will  be 
the  shadows  cast  by  the  bodies  it  illuminates. 

All  the  shaded  bodies  that  are  larger  than  the  pupil,  which  interpose 
between  the  eye  and  the  luminous  body,  will  show  themselves  dark. 

If  the  eye  be  placed  between  the  luminous  body  and  the  bodies 
illuminated  by  this  light,  it  will  see  these  bodies  without  any  shadow. 

c  10  r. 

When  a  luminous  ray  has  passed  through  a  hole  of  some  unusual 
shape  after  a  long  course,  the  impression  it  makes  where  it  strikes 
resembles  the  luminous  body  from  which  it  springs. 


LIGHT   AND   SHADE  961 

It  is  Impossible  for  the  ray  horn  of  a  luminous  spherical  body  to  be 
able,  alter  a  long  course,  to  convey  to  where  it  strikes  the  image  ot  any 
description  of  angle  that  exists  in  the  angular  hole  through  which  it 
passes.  c  10  v. 

The  shape  of  the  derived  shadow  will  always  conform  to  the  shape  of 
the  original  shadow. 

A  light  in  the  form  of  a  cross  thrown  on  to  a  shaded  body  of  spherical 
roundness  will  produce  its  shadow  in  the  figure  of  a  cross,      c  1 1  r. 

That  boundary  of  the  derived  shadow  is  darker  which  is  surrounded 
by  a  brighter  derived  light.  c  n  v. 

Of  things  equal  in  respect  of  size,  brightness,  background  and  length, 
that  which  has  the  smoothest  surface  will  seem  largest. 

Iron  of  uniform  thickness  half  of  which  is  heated  serves  as  a  proof, 
for  the  part  that  is  heated  appears  larger  than  the  remainder,    c  12  r. 

[Of  broken  shadow] 

The  derived  shadow  which  has  as  its  origin  and  cause  a  spherical 
shaded  and  luminous  body,  and  is  broken  by  the  percussion  made  by 
it  upon  different  bodies  situated  at  varying  degrees  of  distance,  will 
appear  round  to  the  eye  that  is  in  front  of  it  situated  near  to  the  centre 
of  the  original  shadow. 

A  shaded  body  of  spherical  rotundity  will  cast  a  circular  shadow 
blended  [of  light  and  shade]  when  it  has  a  shaded  body  of  its  own 
substance  interposed  between  it  and  the  sun.  c  12  v. 

Among  shadows  of  equal  quality  that  nearest  the  eye  will  appear 
least  dark. 

That  shadow  will  be  darker  which  is  derived  from  a  greater  number 
of  different  shaded  and  luminous  bodies. 

It  is  impossible  that  simple  derived  shadows,  which  spring  from  dif- 
ferent bodies  and  are  caused  by  a  single  light,  can  ever  join  or  touch 
each  other.  c  13  v. 

[When  adjacent  bodies  will  appear  separated] 

If  many  shaded  bodies,  so  near  to  each  other  as  to  be  almost  touch- 
ing, are  seen  against  a  luminous  background  at  a  great  distance,  they 
wUl  seem  separated  by  a  great  space.  c  14  r. 


962  LIGHT  AND  SHADE 

[When  separated  bodies  will  appear  adjacent] 

If  many  luminous  bodies  are  seen  in  a  distant  landscape,  although 
they  may  be  separated  one  from  another,  they  will  appear  united  and 
joined  together. 

That  part  of  the  air  will  participate  most  in  its  natural  darkness 
which  is  smitten  by  the  sharpest  luminous  angle.  It  is  clearly  to  be 
understood  that  where  there  is  a  smaller  luminous  angle  there  is  less 
light,  because  the  pyramid  of  this  angle  has  a  smaller  base,  and  there- 
fore from  this  smaller  base  a  lesser  number  of  luminous  rays  con- 
verge at  its  point. 

[Definitions] 

Darkness  is  the  absence  of  light. 

Shadow  is  the  diminution  of  light. 

Primitive  shadow  is  that  which  is  attached  to  shaded  bodies. 

Derived  shadow  is  that  which  separates  itself  from  shaded  bodies 
and  travels  through  the  air. 

Repercussed  shadow  is  that  which  is  surrounded  by  an  illuminated 
surface. 

The  simple  shadow  is  that  which  does  not  see  any  part  of  the  light 
which  causes  it. 

The  simple  shadow  commences  in  the  line  which  parts  it  from  the 
boundaries  of  the  luminous  bodies.  c  14  v. 

Rays  doubled  by  intersection  in  lights  and  shadows  are  also  of  dou- 
ble clearness  or  obscurity: 

Primitive  light  and  derived  reflected  light,  when  they  surround  thick 
and  spherical  bodies,  become  the  cause  of  the  boundaries  of  the  primi- 
tive shadows  of  these  bodies,  being  so  much  more  distinct  and  de- 
fined in  the  part  near  to  the  lights  as  the  derived  light  is  clearer  than 
the  primitive. 

That  is  said  to  be  primitive  light  which  first  lights  up  shaded  bodies, 
and  that  is  called  derived  which  leaps  back  from  these  bodies  in  those 
parts  which  are  remote  from  this  primitive  light. 

That  part  of  the  primitive  shadow  will  be  more  luminous  which  can 
see  more  equally  the  centres  of  the  derived  lights. 

One  may  clearly  know  that  that  part  of  the  shaded  bodies  which  is 


LIGHT  AND  SHADE  963 

seen  by  a  greater  quantity  is  the  more  luminous,  and  especially  if  it  is 
illumined  by  two  lights;  as  is  seen  with  reflected  Lights  which  put  in 
their  midst  the  derived  shadow  made  between  them  by  the  dense 
bodies  opposite. 

Every  luminous  body  illumines  with  its  whole  and  with  its  part  the 
part  and  the  whole  of  the  object  turned  to  face  it. 

This  proposition  is  very  evident,  for  one  cannot  deny  that  where 
the  whole  pupil  of  the  eye  is  looking,  there  every  part  of  it  is  looking, 
and  the  place  seen  by  this  pupil  acts  in  the  same  way  towards  it. 

c  16  v. 

The  middle  of  the  length  of  each  derived  shadow  is  in  a  straight 
line  with  the  middle  of  the  primitive  shadow  and  of  the  derived  light, 
and  the  centres  of  the  shaded  and  luminous  bodies. 

This  necessarily  happens,  since  as  the  luminous  lines  are  straight, 
those  which  pass  by  the  extremities  of  the  shaded  bodies  enclose  within 
their  concourse  all  that  air  which  through  the  intervention  of  this 
shaded  body  cannot  see  the  luminous  body,  and  for  this  reason  it  be- 
comes dark.  As  the  body  is  equally  enclosed  the  parts  of  the  shadow 
become  equal  in  respect  to  its  centre,  because  all  the  parts  of  shaded 
bodies  are  also  equidistant  from  their  centre,  and  so  every  body  has  a 
centre  in  itself. 

As  the  above-named  luminous  lines  are  in  contact  with  each  ex- 
tremity of  the  thing  enclosed  within  them,  they  are  equidistant  from 
the  middle  of  the  length  of  any  object  that  they  enclose. 

That  part  of  the  primitive  and  derived  shadow  will  be  so  much  less 
dark  as  it  is  more  distant  from  its  centre. 

This  comes  about  because  the  more  the  shadow  separates  from  its 
centre  the  more  it  is  seen  by  a  greater  quantity  of  luminous  rays,  and 
every  man  knows  that  where  there  is  more  light  there  is  less  shadow.

OF  THE  SUN'S  REFLECTION  UPON  THE  WATER 

If  the  sun  is  seen  by  all  the  seas  which  have  the  day,  all  these  seas 
are  seen  by  the  sun.  Therefore  all  the  illumined  water  makes  itself  the 
mirror  of  the  sun;  and  by  its  image  all  in  the  whole  of  this  water  and 
-all  in  a  part  it  appears  to  the  eye.  I  ask  therefore  why  when  a  ship  is 


964  LIGHT   AND   SHADE 

travelling  and  the  sun  sees  itself,  the  eye  does  not  see  the  sea  all 
illumined,  and  why  it  does  not  always  seem  that  the  sun  is  travelling 
along  the  pathway  of  the  boat. 

Definition 

The  sun  makes  as  many  pyramids  as  there  are  holes  and  crevices  by 
which  it  can  penetrate  with  its  rays,  and  as  many  as  the  eyes  of  the 
animated  beings  that  look  upon  it.  Therefore  as  the  sun  finds  itself 
always  the  base  of  each  pyramid,  the  sun  mirrored  in  the  water  seems 
to  the  eye  to  be  as  much  beneath  the  water  as  it  is  outside  it,  and  this 
sun  thus  reflected  forms  the  base  of  the  pyramid  which  ends  in  the 
eye.  And  this  reflected  sun  will  appear  as  great  as  the  section  of  the 
pyramid  cut  by  the  surface  of  the  water  at  a  n  [figure].         c  17  v. 

Although  the  shaded  and  luminous  body  be  of  spherical  rotundity 
and  equal  size,  nevertheless  its  derived  shadow  will  not  resemble  the 
rotundity  of  the  body  from  which  it  proceeds,  but  will  be  of  elongated 
shape  if  it  falls  within  unequal  angles.  c  18  r. 

[Of  the  shapes  of  shadows] 

The  shapes  of  shadows  often  resemble  the  shaded  body  which  is 
their  origin,  and  often  the  luminous  body  which  is  their  cause. 

If  the  shape  and  size  of  the  luminous  body  are  like  that  of  the 
shaded  body,  the  primitive  and  derived  shadows  will  have  the  shape 
and  size  of  these  bodies,  falling  within  equal  angles. 

The  derived  shadow  at  a  certain  distance  will  never  resemble  the 
shape  of  the  shaded  body  from  which  it  proceeds,  unless  the  shape  of 
the  light  from  this  illuminating  body  resembles  the  shape  of  the  body 
illuminated  by  the  said  light. 

Light  that  is  long  in  shape  will  cause  the  derived  shadow  born  from 
a  round  body  to  be  wide  and  low,  although  it  makes  its  percussion 
between  equal  angles. 

It  is  impossible  that  the  shape  of  the  derived  shadow  should  resemble 
that  of  the  shaded  body  from  which  it  was  born,  unless  the  light  that 
causes  it  is  similar  in  shape  and  size  to  this  shaded  body.       c  18  v. 

There  will  be  as  much  difference  in  the  darkness  of  two  partially 
shaded  rays  as  between  the  shadow  that  results  from  their  blending 
and  its  first  condition. 


LIGHT   AND  SHADE  05 

It  is  impossible  that  from  the  blending  of  two  complete  shadows 
there  should  ensue  a  shadow  darker  in  degree. 

It  is  possible  that  from  the  blending  of  two  incomplete  shadows  may 
result  a  perfect  shadow  darker  in  degree  than  any  of  the  former? 

c  19  r. 

Universally  all  the  points  that  form  the  extreme  points  of  the  pyra- 
midal images  of  things  are  continually  all  in  all  the  air,  united  and 
joined  together  without  any  intermission. 

Necessity  causes  that  nature  ordains  or  has  ordained  that  in  all 
points  of  the  air  all  the  images  of  the  things  opposite  to  them  con- 
verge, by  the  pyramidal  concourse  of  the  rays  that  have  emanated  from 
these  things;  and  if  it  were  not  so  the  eye  would  not  discern  in  every 
point  of  the  air  that  is  between  it  and  the  thing  seen,  the  shape  and 
quality  of  the  thing  facing  it. 

That  pyramid  which  proceeds  from  its  base  with  more  unequal 
angles  will  be  narrower,  and  will  give  a  less  accurate  impression  of 
the  true  width  of  the  base. 

Among  the  many  pyramids  that  are  founded  upon  a  single  base  that 
will  be  more  powerful  which  is  larger,  and  that  will  be  larger  which 
has  the  angles  of  its  base  more  equal  one  to  the  other.  c  20  r. 

The  less  the  brightness  of  the  derived  as  compared  with  that  of  the 
original  light,  the  less  will  its  pyramids  illumine  the  spot  on  which 
they  strike. 

The  pyramids  will  illumine  the  spot  on  which  they  strike  the  less 
as  their  angles  are  finer.  c  20  v. 

The  farther  the  derived  shadow  extends  from  the  primitive  the 
brighter  it  becomes. 

Such  proportion  as  the  diameter  of  the  derived  shadow  has  to  that 
of  the  primitive,  you  will  find  between  the  darkness  of  the  primitive 
shadow  and  that  of  the  derived. 

If  the  size  of  the  illuminating  body  should  surpass  that  of  the  body 
which  is  illumined,  it  will  form  an  intersection  of  shadow,  beyond 
which  the  divided  shadows  will  pass  off  in  two  different  directions,  as 
though  they  derived  from  two  different  lights.

That  part  of  the  derived  shadow  will  be  darker  which  is  nearer  to  its 
source. 

The  above  proposition  holds  good  because,  where  the  larger  lumi- 
nous angle  is  united  to  the  narrower  shaded  angle,  this  luminous  angle 
subdues  it  and  almost  changes  it  to  its  luminous  nature.  And  so  it  is 
presumed  that,  where  the  larger  shaded  angle  is  united  with  the  nar- 
rower luminous  angle,  the  shaded  will  almost  transform  to  its  own 
nature  the  luminous  that  is  joined  to  it.  c  21  r. 

Of  things  which  are  the  same  in  size  and  colour  that  which  is  farther 
away  will  seem  lighter  and  less  in  bulk. 

The  percussion  of  the  derived  shadow  is  always  surrounded  by 
shadow  that  melts  into  the  luminous  background. 

That  part  of  the  shaded  body  which  is  struck  by  the  largest  luminous 
angle  will  be  more  illuminated  than  any  other.  c  21  v. 

When  there  are  several  bodies  of  equal  size  which  are  equally  dis- 
tant from  the  eye,  that  will  appear  the  smaller  which  is  against  a  more 
luminous  background. 

Every  visible  body  is  surrounded  by  light  and  shade. 

Every  perfectly  round  body  when  surrounded  by  light  and  shade 
will  seem  to  have  one  of  its  sides  greater  than  the  other,  in  proportion 
as  the  one  is  more  lighted  than  the  other.  c  24  r. 

If  the  visual  line  that  sees  the  shadow  made  by  the  light  of  the 
candle  has  an  angle  equal  to  that  of  the  shadow,  the  shadow  will 
almost  seem  to  function  beneath  the  body  that  causes  it,  as  does  the 
image  of  the  bodies  reflected  by  the  water,  for  they  are  as  much  visi- 
ble beneath  it  as  above.  Even  so  this  shadow  will  so  function  that  its 
extremity  will  appear  to  be  as  far  below  the  surface  on  which  it  is 
produced,  as  the  summit  of  the  body  which  causes  it  is  above  this 
surface,  as  is  seen  on  a  wall.  c  25  r. 

PERSPECTIVE 

The  eye  that  finds  itself  between  the  light  and  shade  which  surround 
opaque  bodies,  will  see  there  the  shadow  separated  from  the  luminous 
part  pass  transversely  through  the  centre  of  this  body. 


LIGHT  AND  SHADE  967 

When  two  objects  arc  seen  within  the  above-mentioned  visual  pyra- 
mids, in  such  a  way  as  not  to  fall  short  of  or  protrude  beyond  these 
lines,  although  there  be  a  great  intervening  space  between  them,  this 
distance,  nevertheless,  will  never  be  capable  of  being  seen  or  recognised 
by  the  eye. 

The  greater  the  distance  between  the  above-named  bodies  enclosed 
within  visual  pyramidal  lines,  the  more  necessary  is  it  that  there  be  a 
proportionate  lack  of  conformity  between  them.  c  27  r. 

OF  THE  THREE  KINDS  OF  LIGHTS  WHICH  ILLUMINE 
OPAQUE  BODIES 

The  first  of  the  lights  with  which  opaque  bodies  are  illumined  is 
called  particular,  and  it  is  the  sun  or  other  light  from  a  window  or 
flame.  The  second  is  universal,  as  is  seen  in  cloudy  weather  or  in  mist 
or  the  like.  The  third  is  the  composite,  that  is  when  the  sun  in  the 
evening  or  the  morning  is  entirely  below  the  horizon.  e  3  v. 

Among  bodies  in  varying  degrees  of  darkness  deprived  of  the  same 
light,  there  will  be  the  same  proportion  between  their  shadows  as  there 
is  between  their  natural  degrees  of  darkness,  and  you  have  to  under- 
stand the  same  of  their  lights.  e  15  r. 

PAINTING 

You  will  note  in  drawing  how  among  shadows  some  are  indistin- 
guishable in  gradation  and  form;  and  this  is  proved  by  the  fifch  which 
says: — spherical  surfaces  have  as  many  different  degrees  of  light  and 
shadow  as  there  are  varieties  of  brightness  and  darkness  reflected  from 
the  objects  round  them. 

That  part  of  an  opaque  body  will  be  more  in  shadow  or  more  in 
light  which  is  nearer  to  the  dark  body  which  shades  it,  or  to  the 
luminous  body  which  gives  it  light. 

The  surface  of  every  opaque  body  partakes  of  the  colour  of  its  ob- 
ject, but  the  impression  is  greater  or  less  in  proportion  as  this  object 
is  nearer  or  more  remote,  and  of  greater  or  less  power. 

Objects  seen  between  light  and  shadow  will  appear  in  greater  relief 
than  those  which  are  in  the  light  or  in  the  shadow.  e  17  r. 


968  LIGHT  AND  SHADE 

In  the  position  of  the  eye  which  sees  illuminated  such  part  of  plants 
as  behold  the  light,  one  plant  will  never  appear  illuminated  like  the 
other.  This  is  proved  as  follows: — let  c  be  the  eye  that  beholds  the 
two  plants  b  d  which  are  illuminated  by  the  sun  a;  I  affirm  that  this 
eye  c  will  not  perceive  the  lights  in  the  same  proportion  to  their 
shadows  in  the  one  tree  as  in  the  other;  for  the  tree  that  is  nearer  to 
the  sun  will  show  itself  more  in  shadow  than  that  farther  away,  in 
proportion  as  the  one  tree  is  nearer  than  the  other  to  the  concourse  of 
the  solar  rays  which  come  to  the  eye. 

When  a  tree  is  seen  from  below,  the  eye  sees  the  top  of  it  set  within 
the  circle  formed  by  its  branches. 

Remember,  O  painter,  that  the  degrees  of  depth  of  shade  in  one 
particular  species  of  tree  vary  as  much  as  the  sparseness  or  density  of 
its  ramifications.  e  18  v. 

QUALITY  OF  SHADOWS 

As  regards  the  equal  diffusion  of  light,  there  will  be  the  same  pro- 
portion between  the  degrees  of  obscurity  of  the  shadows  produced,  as 
there  is  between  the  degrees  of  obscurity  of  the  colours  to  which  these 
shadows  are  joined. 


OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  SHADOW 

The  movement  of  the  shadow  is  always  more  rapid  than  the  move- 
ment of  the  body  which  produces  it,  if  the  luminous  body  be  station- 
ary. This  may  be  proved: — let  a  be  the  luminous,  b  the  shaded  body,  d 
the  shadow.  I  say  that  the  shaded  body  b  moves  to  c  in  the  same  time 
as  the  shadow  d  moves  to  e,  and  there  is  the  same  proportion  of  speed 
to  speed  over  the  same  time  as  there  is  of  length  of  movement  to 
length  of  movement.  Therefore  the  proportion  of  the  length  of  the 
movement  made  by  the  shaded  body  b  as  far  as  c,  to  the  length  of  the 
movement  made  by  the  shadow  d  as  far  as  e,  is  such  as  the  above- 
mentioned  speeds  of  movement  have  to  each  other. 

But  if  the  luminous  body  be  equal  in  speed  to  the  movement  of  the 
shaded  body,  then  the  shadow  and  the  shaded  body  will  be  of  equal 
movements  one  to  another.  And  if  the  luminous  be  swifter  than  the 


LIGHT   AND   SHADK 

shaded  body,  then  the  movement  of  the  shadow  will  be  slower  than  the 
movement  of  the  shaded  body. 

But  if  the  luminous  is  slower  than  the  shaded  body  then  the  shadow 
will  be  swifter  than  the  shaded  body.  e  30  v. 


OF  THE  PYRAMIDAL  SHADOW 

The  pyramidal  shadow  produced  by  the  parallel  body  will  be  nar- 
rower than  the  shaded  body,  in  proportion  as  the  simple  derived 
shadow  is  intersected  at  a  greater  distance  from  its  shaded  body. 


OF  SIMPLE  DERIVED  SHADOWS 

The  simple  derived  shadows  are  of  two  kinds,  that  is  to  say  one 
finite  in  length  and  two  infinite.  The  finite  is  pyramidal,  and  of  those 
that  are  infinite  one  is  columnar  and  the  other  expanding.  And  all 
three  have  straight  sides,  but  the  convergent,  that  is  the  pyramidal 
shadow,  proceeds  from  a  shaded  body  that  is  less  than  the  luminous 
body,  the  columnar  proceeds  from  a  shaded  body  equal  to  the  lumi- 
nous body,  and  the  expanding  from  a  shaded  body  greater  than  the 
luminous  body. 

OF  COMPOUND  DERIVED  SHADOWS 

Compound  derived  shadows  are  of  two  kinds,  that  is,  columnar  and 
expanding.  e  31  r. 

OF  LIGHT  AND  LUSTRE 

The  difference  that  exists  between  light  and  lustre  that  reveals  itself 
on  the  smooth  surface  of  opaque  bodies: — The  lights  that  are  pro- 
duced on  the  smooth  surfaces  of  opaque  bodies  will  be  stationary  in 
stationary  bodies,  although  the  eye  which  sees  them  moves;  but  there 
will  be  lustres  upon  the  same  bodies  in  as  many  points  of  its  surface 
as  are  the  positions  upon  which  the  eye  rests. 

Which  bodies  are  those  that  have  light  without  lustre? 

Opaque  bodies  which  have  a  thick  rough  surface  will  never  produce 
lustre  in  any  portion  of  their  illuminated  part. 


970  LIGHT  AND  SHADE 

Which  bodies  are  those  that  have  lustre  and  have  no  illuminated 
part  ? 

Thick,  opaque  bodies,  with  smooth  surface,  are  those  which  have  all 
the  lustre  in  as  many  places,  in  the  illuminated  part,  as  there  are  posi- 
tions that  can  receive  the  angle  of  the  incidence  of  the  light  and  of  the 
eye,  but,  because  such  surface  reflects  all  the  things  that  surround 
the  light,  the  illuminated  body  is  not  distinguishable  in  this  part  of 
the  illuminated  background. 

A  luminous  body  of  long  shape  will  make  the  contours  of  its  derived 
shadow  more  indistinct  than  light  that  is  spherical,  and  this  it  is  that 
controverts  the  following  proposition: — that  shadow  will  have  its  con- 
tours more  distinct  which  is  nearer  the  primitive  shadow,  or  if  you 
prefer,  the  shaded  body,  but  of  this  the  long  shape  of  the  luminous  body 
is  the  cause.  e  31  v. 

OF  SHADOW 

Derived  shadows  are  of  three  kinds,  of  which  one  is  expanding, 
another  in  the  form  of  a  column,  the  third  converging  at  the  point  of 
the  intersection  of  its  sides  which  continue  beyond  in  infinite  length 
and  straightness.  And  if  you  should  say  that  this  shadow  is  terminated 
in  the  angle  formed  by  the  meeting  of  its  sides  and  does  not  pass  be- 
yond, this  is  controverted  by  the  fact  that,  in  the  first  concerning 
shadows,  it  was  proved  that  a  thing  is  entirely  ended  when  no  part  of 
it  exceeds  its  terminating  lines;  and,  in  the  case  of  this  shadow,  one  sees 
the  contrary,  inasmuch  as  where  this  derived  shadow  originates,  there 
there  are  manifestly  created  the  figures  of  two  shaded  pyramids  which 
meet  at  their  angles.  If  however  as  the  adversary  says,  the  first  shaded 
pyramid  terminates  the  derived  shadow  with  its  angle,  from  whence 
does  the  second  shaded  pyramid  proceed?  The  adversary  says  that  it  is 
caused  by  the  angle  and  not  by  the  shaded  body,  but  this  is  denied  by 
the  help  of  the  second  of  this,  which  says: — the  shadow  is  an  accident 
created  by  the  shaded  bodies  interposed  between  the  position  of  this 
shadow  and  the  luminous  body. 

Thus  it  has  become  clear  that  the  shadow  is  not  produced  by  the 
angle  of  the  derived  shadow  but  only  by  the  shaded  body. 

If  a  spherical  shaded  body  is  illumined  by  an  elongated  luminous 
body,  the  shadow  that  is  produced  by  the  longest  part  of  this  luminous 


LIGHT  AND  SHADE  971 

body  will  have  its  contours  less  defined  than  that  produced  by  the 
breadth  of  the  same  light.  And  this  is  proved  by  what  was  said  before, 
namely  that  that  shadow  is  of  less  defined  contours  which  is  created  by 
a  greater  luminous  body,  and  conversely  that  shadow  is  of  more  defined 
contours1  which  is  lit  by  a  smaller  luminous  body. 

Broken  shadows  is  the  term  given  to  those  which  are  seen  on  a 
bright  wall  or  other  luminous  object. 

That  shadow  will  seem  the  darker  which  is  against  a  lighter  ground. 

The  contours  of  the  derived  shadows  will  be  more  distinct  when 
they  are  nearer  to  the  primitive  shadow. 

The  derived  shadow  will  have  the  contours  of  its  impress  more 
distinct  when  they  cut  against  the  wall  within  more  equal  angles. 

That  part  of  the  same  shadow  will  seem  darker  which  has  over 
against  it  darker  objects;  and  that  will  seem  less  dark  which  is  facing  a 
brighter  object.  And  the  bright  object  when  it  is  larger  will  shine  more 
brightly. 

And  that  dark  object  which  is  of  greater  bulk  will  darken  the  derived 
shadow  most  in  the  place  of  its  percussion.  e  32  r. 

The  surface  of  every  opaque  body  shares  in  the  colour  of  surround- 
ing objects. 

Shadow  is  the  diminution  of  light.  Darkness  is  the  exclusion  of  light. 

Shadow  is  divided  into  two  parts,  of  which  the  first  is  called  primary 
shadow  and  the  second  derived  shadow. 

Primary  shadow  always  serves  as  a  basis  for  derived  shadow. 

The  boundaries  of  derived  shadows  are  straight  lines. 

The  darkness  of  the  derived  shadow  diminishes  in  proportion  as  it  is 
farther  removed  from  primary  shadow. 

That  shadow  will  show  itself  darker  which  is  surrounded  by  more 
dazzling  brightness,  and  it  will  be  less  evident  when  it  is  produced  on 
a  darker  ground. 

Particular  light  has  as  a  result  that  it  gives  better  relief  to  shaded 
bodies  than  does  universal  light;  as  may  be  shown  by  the  comparison 
of  the  part  of  a  landscape  lit  by  the  sun  and  that  shaded  by  a  cloud 
which  is  lit  merely  by  the  universal  light  of  the  air.  e  32  v.

That  part  of  a  luminous  body  of  uniform  thickness  and  radiance 
will  seem  thicker  which  is  seen  against  a  darker  background. 


The  ray  of  the  sun  after  having  passed  through  the  bubbles  of  the 
surface  of  the  water,  sends  to  the  bottom  of  the  water  an  image  of  this 
bubble  which  bears  the  form  of  a  cross.  I  have  not  yet  investigated  the 
cause,  but  I  judge  it  to  be  a  result  of  other  small  bubbles  which  are 
clustered  together  round  the  larger  bubble.  f  28  v. 

A  luminous  hole  seen  from  a  dark  place,  though  it  be  of  uniform 
size,  will  seem  to  contract  considerably  when  near  to  any  object  what- 
ever that  is  interposed  between  the  eye  and  this  hole. 

This  statement  is  proved  by  the  seventh  of  this,  which  shows  that 
the  contours  of  any  object  interposed  between  the  eye  and  the  light  will 
never  be  seen  distinctly,  but  confused  through  the  air  becoming  darker 
near  these  contours,  this  darkness  becoming  more  intense  the  nearer  it 
is  to  these  contours.  f  31  r. 

Two  separated  lights  will  at  a  certain  distance  appear  joined  and 
united: 

In  this  case  it  has  been  held  by  many  who  have  made  a  study  of 
perspective,  that  the  air  that  surrounds  these  lights  at  a  great  distance  is 
so  illuminated  that  it  seems  of  the  nature  of  these  lights,  and  therefore 
the  light  and  air  that  surround  them  appear  to  be  the  same  body. 

What  they  say  is  not  true,  for  if  it  were  the  case  that  the  air  that 
surrounds  these  lights  at  a  great  distance  was  so  illuminated  as  to 
appear  all  uniformly  luminous,  this  would  be  more  readily  discerned 
near  at  hand  where  the  exact  shape  of  the  light  is  known  than  it  would 
be  at  a  distance,  and  if,  in  becoming  separated,  the  perception  of  the 
exact  shape  of  this  light  is  lost  because  it  suffers  a  slight  decrease  in  its 
radiance,  how  much  more  would  be  the  diminution  and  loss  of  that 
radiance  of  the  air,  which  is  much  less  effulgent  than  the  light! 


LIGHT   AND   SHADE  973 

We  shall  prove  therefore  that  this  increase  is  caused  by  two  images 
in  the  eye. 

The  excessive  brilliance  of  the  light  when  near  to  the  eye  diminishes 
the  visual  faculty,  seeing  that  the  pupil  being  hurt  contracts  and  so 
makes  itself  less,  and  as  the  light  becomes  more  separated  the  injury 
to  the  eye  ceases  to  exist,  because  the  light  has  less  brilliance,  and  so 
the  pupil  increases  and  sees  a  greater  light.  f  35  v. 

If  there  are  two  luminous  bodies  somewhat  near  to  each  other  at  a 
great  distance  they  will  seem  united: 

This  can  happen  for  two  reasons,  of  which  the  first  is  that  in  being 
near  to  these  lights  one  knows  instantly  the  distance  or  space  that 
separates  them,  and  the  images  of  them  that  imprint  themselves  in  our 
eye  are  still  very  distinct,  and  on  the  other  hand  their  rays  do  not  touch, 
whilst  at  a  long  distance  these  images  look  so  near  that  not  only  their 
rays  but  the  luminous  bodies  seem  to  touch. 

Further,  at  this  distance  the  pupil  which  at  first  was  contracted 
becomes  enlarged,  because  the  brilliance  of  the  light  is  not  as  powerful 
as  when  it  was  near  the  eye,  and  so  the  eye  increasing  the  size  of  its 
pupil  sees  a  thing  appearing  enlarged. 

If  all  the  images  were  to  meet  in  an  angle  they  would  meet  in  a 
mathematical  point,  and  this  being  indivisible  all  the  different  kinds 
would  seem  to  you  united;  being  united  the  sense  would  not  be  able 
to  discern  any  difference.  f  36  r. 

If  some  luminous  body  can  be  seen  through  a  very  small  hole  made 
in  a  piece  of  paper,  approach  the  luminous  body  as  nearly  as  possible 
with  the  eye;  even  though  it  still  may  be  seen  in  its  entirety  it  will 
seem  so  much  less  than  before  as  this  hole  is  of  less  size.        f  36  v. 

If  the  shape  of  the  waves  were  in  the  figure  of  a  half-circle,  as  are 
the  bubbles  of  the  water,  the  converging  lines  of  the  images  of  the  sun, 
which  emanate  from  these  waves  and  come  to  the  eye,  would  be  of  a 
very  great  angle,  if  this  eye  were  upon  the  edge  of  the  sea  that  comes 
between  it  and  the  sun.  f  62  v. 

Why  does  every  luminous  object  that  is  of  long  shape  appear  round

die  when  beaten  and  much  crushed  that  it  appears  round  in  shape. 
So  this  light  at  a  great  distance  acquires  such  breadth  in  every  direction, 
for  as  that  which  had  been  added  is  equal,  and  the  first  stock  of  light 
goes  for  nothing  in  comparison  to  what  is  added,  the  acquisition  makes 
it  appear  uniformly  round. 

And  this  serves  to  prove  that  the  horns  of  every  star  are  imperceptible 
at  a  great  distance.  f  64  r. 

OF  LIGHTS 

The  lights  which  illumine  opaque  bodies  are  of  four  kinds,  that  is 
to  say,  universal,  as  that  of  the  atmosphere  within  our  horizon,  and 
particular,  like  that  of  the  sun  or  of  a  window  or  door  or  other  space; 
and  the  third  is  reflected  light;  and  there  is  also  a  fourth  which  passes 
through  substances  of  the  degree  of  transparency  of  linen  or  paper  or 
suchlike  things,  but  not  those  transparent  like  glass  or  crystal  or  other 
diaphanous  bodies,  with  which  the  effect  is  the  same  as  if  there  was 
nothing  interposed  between  the  body  in  shadow  and  the  light  that 
illumines  it;  and  of  these  we  shall  treat  separately  in  our  discourse. 

[Transparency  of  leaves] 

The  shadows  in  transparent  leaves  seen  from  the  underside  are  the 
same  shadows  as  those  on  the  right  side  of  this  leaf,  and  the  shadow  is 
seen  in  transparency  on  the  reverse  at  the  same  time  as  the  luminous 
part;  but  the  lustre  can  never  show  itself  in  transparency.  g  3  v. 

Of  trees  seen  from  below  and  against  the  light,  one  behind  the  other 
at  a  short  distance,  the  topmost  part  of  the  first  will  be  transparent  and 
clear  in  great  part,  and  it  will  stand  out  against  the  dark  part  of  the 
second  tree;  and  so  it  will  be  with  all  in  succession  which  are  situated 
under  the  same  conditions.  g  6  r. 

The  shadows  of  plants  are  never  black,  for  where  the  atmosphere 
penetrates  there  cannot  be  utter  darkness.  g  8  r. 

[Foliage  in  light] 

If  the  light  comes  from  m  and  the  eye  is  at  n,  this  eye  will  see  the 
colour  of  the  leaves  a  b  all  affected  by  the  colour  of  m,  that  is  of  the 
atmosphere,  and  that  of  b  c  will  be  seen  on  the  underside  in  transpar- 
ency, with  a  very  beautiful  green  colour  that  verges  on  yellow. 


LIGHT  AND  SHADE  975 

If  m  is  the  luminous  body  which  lights  up  the  leaf  s,  all  the  eyes  that 
see  the  underside  of  the  leaf  will  see  it  of  a  very  beautiful  light  green 
because  it  is  transparent. 

There  will  be  many  occasions  when  the  positions  of  the  leaves  will 
be  without  shadows,  and  they  will  have  the  underside  transparent  and 
the  right  side  shining.  g  8  v. 

The  willow  and  other  similar  trees  which  are  pollarded  every  third 
or  fourth  year  put  out  very  straight  branches.  Their  shadow  is  towards 
the  centre  where  these  branches  grow,  and  near  their  extremities  they 
cast  but  little  shade  because  of  their  small  leaves  and  few  and  slender 
branches. 

Therefore  the  branches  which  rise  towards  the  sky  will  have  but 
little  shadow  and  little  relief,  and  the  branches  which  point  downwards 
towards  the  horizon  spring  from  the  dark  part  of  the  shadow.  And  they 
become  clearer  by  degrees  down  to  their  extremities,  and  show  them- 
selves in  strong  relief  being  in  varying  stages  of  brightness  against  a 
background  of  shadow. 

That  plant  will  have  least  shadow  which  has  fewest  branches  and 
fewest  leaves.  g  9  r. 

The  leaf  of  concave  surface  seen  on  the  underside  from  below  up- 
ward, will  sometimes  show  itself  half  in  shadow  and  half  transparent. 
Thus  let  o  p  be  the  leaf,  m  the  light  and  n  the  eye  which  will  see  0  in 
shadow,  because  the  light  does  not  strike  there  between  equal  angles 
either  on  the  right  side  or  on  the  reverse;  p  is  lit  up  on  the  right  side, 
and  its  light  is  seen  in  transparency  on  its  reverse.  g  10  v. 


OF  SHADOWS  ON  BODIES 

When  you  represent  the  dark  shadows  in  shaded  bodies,  represent 
always  the  cause  of  the  darkness,  and  you  should  do  the  same  for 
reflections;  this  is  because  the  dark  shadows  proceed  from  dark  objects 
and  the  reflections  from  objects  of  but  little  brightness,  that  is  from 
diminished  lights.  And  there  is  the  same  proportion  between  the  illumi- 
nated part  of  bodies  and  the  part  lit  by  reflection  as  there  is  between 
the  cause  of  the  light  on  the  bodies  and  the  cause  of  the  reflection.

OF  THE  UNIVERSAL  LIGHT  AS  LIGHTING  UP  TREES 

That  part  of  the  tree  will  be  seen  to  be  clothed  in  shadows  of  least 
obscurity  which  is  farthest  away  from  the  earth. 

This  may  be  proved : — let  a  p  be  the  tree,  n  b  c  the  illuminated  hemi- 
sphere. The  under  part  of  the  tree  faces  the  earth  p  c,  that  is  on  the  side 
o,  and  it  faces  a  small  part  of  the  hemisphere  at  c  d.  But  the  highest 
part  of  the  convexity  a  is  visible  to  the  greatest  mass  of  the  hemisphere, 
that  is  b  c\  and  for  this  reason,  and  because  it  does  not  face  the  darkness 
of  the  earth,  it  remains  more  illuminated.  But  if  the  tree  is  one  thick 
with  leaves,  as  the  laurel,  the  arbutus,  the  box  or  the  ilex,  then  it  is 
different,  for  though  a  does  not  see  the  earth  it  sees  the  darkness  of  the 
leaves  divided  by  many  shadows,  and  this  darkness  is  reflected  upwards 
on  to  the  undersides  of  the  leaves  above;  and  these  trees  have  the 
shadows  so  much  darker  as  they  are  nearer  to  the  centre  of  the  tree.

OF  LIGHTS  BETWEEN  SHADOWS 

When  drawing  any  object,  remember  in  comparing  the  potency  of 
the  lights  of  its  illuminated  portions,  that  the  eye  is  often  deceived  into 
thinking  one  brighter  than  it  really  is.  The  reason  springs  from  our 
comparing  them  with  the  parts  which  border  on  them,  for  if  there  are 
two  parts  of  unequal  degrees  of  brightness,  and  the  less  bright  borders 
on  a  dark  part  while  the  brighter  is  set  against  a  light  background,  such 
as  the  sky  or  some  similar  bright  surface,  then  that  which  is  less  bright, 
or  I  should  say  less  radiant,  will  appear  more  radiant  and  what  was 
more  radiant  will  seem  darker.  g  12  v.

SHADOWS  AND  LIGHTS  OF  CITIES 

When  the  sun  is  in  the  east  and  the  eye  is  above  the  centre  of  a  city, 
the  eye  will  see  the  southern  part  of  this  city  with  its  roofs  half  in 
shadow  and  half  in  light,  and  the  same  towards  the  north;  but  those 
in  the  east  will  be  entirely  in  shadow  and  those  in  the  west  entirely  in 
light.  g  19  v. 

OF  PAINTING 

The  oudines  and  forms  of  each  part  of  bodies  in  shadow  are  poorly 
distinguished  in  their  shadows  and  lights,  but  in  such  parts  as  are 
between  the  lights  and  shadows  parts  of  these  bodies  are  of  the  first 
degree  of  distinctness.  c  3:

OF  SITUATION 

Take  careful  note  of  the  situation  of  your  figures,  for  you  will  have 
the  light  and  shade  different  if  the  object  is  in  a  dark  place  with  a 
particular  light,  and  if  it  is  in  a  bright  place  with  the  direct  light  of  the 
sun,  and  different  also  if  it  is  in  a  dark  place  with  the  diffused  light  of 
evening  or  in  dull  weather,  and  if  it  is  in  the  diffused  light  of  the 
atmosphere  lit  by  the  sun.  g  33  v. 

That  part  of  the  primary  shadow  will  be  least  dark  which  is  at  the 
farthest  distance  from  its  extremities. 

The  derived  shadow  which  borders  on  the  primary  shadow  will  be 
darker  than  this  primary  shadow.  h  66  [18]  r. 

That  place  will  be  most  luminous  which  is  farthest  away  from  moun- 
tains, h  68  [20]  r. 

The  derived  shadow  is  never  like  the  body  from  which  it  proceeds, 
unless  the  light  is  of  the  shape  and  size  of  the  body  in  shadow. 

The  derived  shadow  cannot  be  like  the  primitive  in  shape  unless  it 
strikes  within  equal  angles.  h  76  [28]  v.

OF  THE  LUMINOUS  RAYS  AND  THE  POWER  OF  THEIR 
EXTREMITIES 

[Diagram] 

Because  the  luminous  ray  is  of  pyramidal  power,  and  especially 
when  the  atmosphere  is  uniform,  it  will  come  about  that  when  two 
rays  emanating  from  equal  lights  meet  in  a  straight  line,  the  ray  will 
be  everywhere  doubled  and  of  uniform  power;  for  where  one  has  the 
apex  of  the  pyramid  the  other  has  its  base,  as  n  m  shows.  i  33  r. 

The  imprint  of  the  shadow  of  any  body  of  uniform  thickness  will 
never  resemble  the  body  from  whence  it  proceeds. 

Although  a  shaded  body  be  pyramidal  and  equally  distant  in  each 
of  its  parts  from  the  luminous  object,  nevertheless  that  part  of  the 
pyramid  which  is  smaller  than  the  light  that  illumines  it  will  not  throw 
its  shadow  any  distance  from  its  cause.  1  37  v. 

OF  PAINTING 

Shadows  and  lights  are  observed  by  the  eye  under  three  aspects.  One 
of  these  is  when  the  eye  and  the  light  are  both  on  the  same  side  of  the 
body  which  is  seen;  the  second  is  when  the  eye  is  in  front  of  the  object 
and  the  light  behind  it;  and  the  third  is  that  in  which  the  eye  is  in 
front  of  the  object  and  the  light  at  the  side,  in  such  a  way  that  when 
the  line  which  extends  from  the  object  to  the  eye  meets  that  which 
extends  from  the  object  to  the  light,  they  will  at  their  junction  *  form 
a  right  angle.  k  105  [25]  v. 

There  is  another  division,  namely  that  of  the  nature  of  the  reflected 
object  when  placed  between  the  eye  and  the  light  in  different  aspects.

LIGHT  AND  SHADE  979 

The  same  quality  of  shadow  seems  stronger  in  proportion  as  it  is 
nearer  to  the  eye. 

The  percussion  and  section  of  the  derived  shadow  is  darker  in  pro- 
portion as  it  is  shorter.  k.  hi  [31 J  v. 

[Luminous  rays] 

That  part  of  the  body  will  be  illuminated  which  is  struck  by  the 
luminous  rays  at  more  equal  angles.  m  77  v. 

The  image  of  the  sun  will  show  itself  brighter  in  the  small  waves 
than  in  the  large  ones.  This  happens  because  the  reflections  or  images 
of  the  sun  occur  more  frequently  in  the  small  waves  than  in  the  large 
ones,  and  the  more  numerous  brightnesses  give  a  greater  light  than  the 
lesser  number. 

The  waves  which  intersect  after  the  manner  of  the  scales  of  a  fir-cone 
reflect  the  image  of  the  sun  with  the  greatest  splendour;  and  this  occurs 
because  there  are  as  many  images  as  there  are  ridges  of  the  waves  seen 
by  the  sun,  and  the  shadows  which  intervene  between  these  waves  are 
small  and  not  very  dark;  and  the  radiance  of  so  many  reflections  is 
blended  together  in  the  image  which  proceeds  from  them  to  the  eye, 
in  such  a  way  that  these  shadows  are  imperceptible.  b.m.  25  r. 

There  are  two  different  kinds  of  light;  the  one  is  called  free,  the 
other  restricted.  The  free  is  that  which  freely  illuminates  bodies; 
restricted  is  that  which  illuminates  bodies  in  the  same  manner,  through 
some  hole  or  window.  b.m.  170  v. 

Lights  are  of  two  different  natures,  the  one  separated  and  the  other 
united  to  bodies. 

Separated  is  that  which  illuminates  the  body,  united  is  the  part  of 
the  body  illuminated  by  this  light;  the  one  light  is  called  primary,  the 
other  derived. 

And  so  also  there  are  shadows  of  two  kinds;  the  one  primary  the 
other  derived.  Primary  is  that  which  is  fastened  to  bodies,  derived  is 
that  which  is  separated  from  bodies,  bearing  in  itself  to  the  surface  of 
walls  the  resemblance  of  its  cause.  b.m.  171  r. 

A  simple  shadow  is  one  which  does  not  see  any  light. 
A  compound  shadow  is  one  which  is  illuminated  by  one  or  more 
lights.  b.m.  248  v. 


980  LIGHT   AND   SHADE 

A  sieve  through  which  penetrates  the  luminous  air,  at  a  great  dis 
tance  will  seem  without  holes  and  entirely  luminous. 

Forster  in  35  v. 

Between  walls  at  an  equal  distance  and  quality  which  are  seen 
behind  the  extremities  of  an  opaque  body  set  over  against  them,  that 
part  of  the  wall  will  appear  more  illuminated  which  is  seen  by  a  greater 
amount  of  the  pupil.  Forster  in  36  r. 

Among  things  of  equal  distance  and  size  that  which  has  the  greater 
light  will  seem  of  greater  body.  Forster  m  42  v. 

If  the  illuminated  object  is  the  size  of  the  thing  that  illuminates, 
and  of  that  where  this  light  is  reflected,  the  quality  of  the  reflex  light 
will  have  the  same  proportion  to  the  intermediate  light  as  this  second 
light  has  to  the  first,  if  these  bodies  are  smooth  and  white. 

Forster  in  54  r. 

The  luminous  or  illuminated  object  contiguous  to  the  shadow  cuts 
as  much  as  it  touches. 

There  will  be  as  much  lacking  in  the  extremities  of  the  shadows  of 
bodies  as  is  touched  by  the  illuminated  or  luminous  field. 

Forster  in  87  v. 
[Of  shadow] 

Shadow  is  the  diminution  of  light  and  of  darkness,  and  it  is  inter- 
posed between  darkness  and  light. 

Shadow  is  of  infinite  obscurity,  and  this  obscurity  may  be  infinitely 
diminished. 

The  beginnings  and  the  ends  of  shadow  extend  between  light  and 
darkness,  and  they  may  be  infinitely  diminished  and  increased. 

Shadow  is  the  expression  of  bodies  and  of  their  shapes. 

The  shapes  of  bodies  will  convey  no  perception  of  their  quality 
without  shadow. 

Shadow  partakes  always  of  the  colour  of  its  object. 

Of  the  boundaries  of  shadows:  some  are  like  smoke,  with  boundaries 
that  cannot  be  perceived,  in  others  they  are  distinct. 

Keep  the  drawings  for  the  end  of  the  [book  on]  shadows.  They  may 


LIGHT  AND  SHADE  981 

be  seen  in  the  workshop  of  Gherardo  the  miniaturist  in  San  Marco  at 
Florence. 

No  opaque  body  is  without  shadow  or  light,  except  when  there  is  a 
mist  lying  over  the  ground  when  it  is  covered  with  snow,  or  it  is  the 
same  when  it  snows  in  the  country;  this  will  be  without  light  and  it 
will  be  surrounded  by  darkness. 

And  this  occurs  in  spherical  bodies,  because  in  the  case  of  other 
bodies  which  have  members,  the  parts  of  the  members  which  face  each 
other  steep  each  other  in  the  tone  of  their  surface. 

The  surface  of  every  body  is  infused  into  all  the  illuminated  air 
which  serves  as  its  object. 

The  surface  of  opaque  bodies  has  its  whole  image  in  all  the  illu- 
minated air  which  surrounds  it  from  every  quarter. 

Make  the  rainbow  in  the  last  book  'On  Painting'.  But  first  make  the 
book  of  the  colours  produced  by  the  mixture  of  the  other  colours,  so 
that  by  means  of  these  colours  used  by  painters  you  may  be  able  to 
prove  the  genesis  of  the  colours  of  the  rainbow. 

Describe  how  no  body  is  in  itself  defined  in  the  mirror;  but  the  eye 
on  seeing  it  in  this  mirror  puts  boundaries  to  it;  for  if  you  cause  your 
face  to  be  represented  in  the  mirror  the  part  is  like  the  whole,  seeing 
that  the  part  is  all  in  the  whole  of  the  mirror  and  it  is  complete  in 
every  part  of  the  same  mirror;  and  the  same  happens  with  every  image 
of  every  object  set  in  front  of  this  mirror. 

The  boundaries  of  the  derived  shadow  are  surrounded  by  the  colours 
of  the  illuminated  objects  which  are  round  the  luminous  body,  the 
cause  of  this  shadow. 

Derived  shadow  does  not  exist  without  primary  light:  this  is  proved 
by  the  First  of  this,  which  states  that  darkness  is  the  entire  privation  of 
light,  and  shadow  is  the  gradual  diminution  of  darkness  and  of  light; 
and  it  partakes  so  much  the  more  or  the  less  of  darkness  than  of  light 
in  proportion  as  the  darkness  has  been  broken  up  by  this  light. 

What  is  the  cause  which  makes  the  boundaries  of  the  shadow  con- 
fused and  indistinct. 

Whether  it  is  possible  to  give  the  contours  of  the  shadows  clear-cut 
and  precise  boundaries.  Quaderni  11  6  r.

[  Of  luminous  bodies] 

PAINTING 

Of  bodies  equal  in  size  and  distance  that  which  is  most  luminous 
tinges  most  with  its  essence  the  opposite  object. 

Of  bodies  of  equal  luminosity  that  which  is  largest  in  outline  tinges 
most  of  the  surface  of  its  object,  the  distance  of  all  being  equal. 

Of  bodies  which  are  equal  in  luminosity  and  size  that  which  is 
nearest  tinges  its  object  most.  Quaderni  n  16  r. 

The  reason  why  we  know  that  light  has  in  itself  a  single  centre  is  as 
follows: — we  recognise  clearly  that  a  large  light  often  outspans  a  small 
object,  which  nevertheless,  although  it  surrounds  it  much  more  than 
twice  with  its  rays,  always  has  its  shadow  appearing  on  the  first  sur- 
face and  it  is  always  visible. 

Let  c  f  be  the  large  light  and  n  the  object  in  front  of  it  which  pro- 
duces the  shadow  on  the  wall,  and  a  b  the  wall;  it  clearly  appears  that 
it  is  not  the  large  light  that  will  cast  the  shadow  of  n  upon  the  wall; 
but  since  the  light  has  a  centre  in  itself  I  prove  by  experiment  the 
shadow  is  cast  upon  the  wall  as  is  shown  ax.  m  o  t  r.  [Diagram] 

Why  to  two  or  in  front  of  two  eyes  do  three  things  when  represented 
appear  as  two. 

Why  in  surveying  a  direction  with  two  sights  the  first  appears 
untrue. 

I  say  the  eye  projects  an  infinite  number  of  lines,  and  these  attach 
themselves  to  or  mingle  with  those  that  come  towards  it  which  emanate 
from  the  things  seen,  and  only  the  centre  line  of  this  perceptive  faculty 
is  that  which  knows  and  judges  bodies  and  colours;  all  the  others  are 
false  and  deceitful. 

And  when  you  place  two  things  at  a  distance  of  a  cubit  one  from  the 
other,  the  nearer  being  close  to  the  eye,  the  surface  of  this  nearer  one 
will  remain  far  more  confused  than  that  of  the  second,  the  reason  being 
that  the  nearer  is  overrun  by  a  greater  number  of  false  lines  than  the 
second  and  so  is  more  uncertain. 
[Diagram] 

Light  acts  like  this  because  in  the  effects  of  its  lines  and  especially 
in  the  working  of  its  perspective  it  is  very  similar  to  the  eye;  and  its 


LIGHT  AND  SHADE  983 

centre  ray  carries  truth  in  its  testing  of  shadows.  When  the  object 
placed  in  front  of  it  is  too  rapidly  subdued  by  dim  rays,  it  will  cast  a 
shadow  broad  and  disproportionately  large  and  ill  defined;  but  when 
the  object  that  has  to  produce  the  shadow  cuts  the  rays  of  the  light  and 
is  near  the  place  of  percussion,  then  the  shadow  becomes  distinct;  and 
this  especially  when  the  light  is  at  a  distance,  because  the  centre  ray  at 
a  long  distance  is  less  interfered  with  by  false  rays,  seeing  that  the  lines 
of  the  eye  and  the  solar  and  other  luminous  rays  proceeding  through 
the  air  are  obliged  to  keep  a  straight  course.  Otherwise  if  they  were 
impeded  by  the  atmosphere  being  denser  or  more  rarefied  they  would 
remain  bent  at  some  point,  but  if  the  air  is  free  from  heaviness  or 
humidity  they  will  observe  their  straight  nature,  always  carrying  back 
to  their  point  of  origin  the  image  of  the  intercepting  object,  and  if  it 
is  the  eye  the  intercepting  object  will  be  estimated  by  its  colour  as  well 
as  by  its  shape  and  size.  But  if  the  surface  of  the  said  interposing  object 
shall  have  within  it  some  small  hole  that  enters  into  a  room  dark  not 
on  account  of  its  colour  but  through  absence  of  light,  you  will  see  the 
rays  entering  through  this  small  hole  transmitting  there,  to  the  wall 
beyond,  all  the  traits  of  their  original  both  as  to  colour  and  form,  except 
that  everything  will  be  inverted.  Windsor:  Drawings  19148  v. 

The  way  in  which  the  images  of  bodies  intersect  at  the  edges  of  the 
small  holes  by  which  they  penetrate : 

What  difference  is  there  between  the  manner  of  penetration  of  the 
images  which  pass  through  narrow  apertures  and  those  which  pass 
through  wide  ones  or  those  which  pass  at  the  sides  of  shaded  bodies. 

OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  THE  IMAGES  OF  IMMOVABLE 

OBJECTS 

The  images  of  the  immovable  objects  move  by  the  moving  of  the 
edges  of  that  aperture  through  which  the  rays  of  the  images  penetrate, 
and  this  comes  about  by  the  ninth  [section]  which  says: — the  images  of 
any  body  are  all  in  all  and  all  in  every  part  of  the  area  that  is  round 
about  them.  It  follows  that  the  moving  of  one  of  the  edges  of  the 
aperture  by  which  these  images  penetrate  to  a  dark  place  releases  the 


984  LIGHT  AND   SHADE 

rays  of  the  images  that  were  in  contact  with  it,  and  they  unite  with 
other  rays  of  those  images  which  were  remote  from  it. 


OF  THE  MOVEMENT  OF  THE  RIGHT  OR  LEFT  OR  UPPER 
OR  LOWER  EDGE 

If  you  move  the  right  side  of  the  opening  the  impression  on  the  left 
will  move,  being  that  of  the  object  on  the  right  which  entered  by  this 
opening,  and  the  same  will  happen  with  all  the  other  sides  of  this  open- 
ing, and  this  is  proved  with  the  help  of  the  second  [section]  of  this 
[treatise]  which  says: — all  the  rays  which  carry  the  images  of  bodies 
through  the  air  are  straight  lines.  Therefore  as  the  images  of  the  great- 
est bodies  have  to  pass  through  the  smallest  openings,  and  beyond  this 
opening  to  re-form  in  their  utmost  expansion,  it  is  necessary  that  this 
intersection  be  uninterrupted.  Windsor:  Drawings  19 149  r. 

The  images  of  bodies  are  all  diffused  through  the  air  which  sees 
them  and  all  in  every  part  of  it. 

This  is  proved: — let  a  c  and  e  be  objects,  of  which  the  images  pene- 
trate to  a  dark  place  by  the  small  holes  n  p,  and  imprint  themselves  on 
the  wall  /  i  opposite  to  these  holes;  as  many  impressions  will  be  made 
at  as  many  different  places  on  this  wall  as  is  the  number  of  the  said 
small  holes. 


OF  THE  RAYS  WHICH  CARRY  THROUGH  THE  AIR  THE 
IMAGES  OF  BODIES 

All  the  smallest  parts  of  the  images  penetrate  one  another  without 
occupation  the  one  of  the  other.  .  .  .

Although  the  balls  a  b  c  have  their  light  from  one  window,  never-

LIGHT  AND  SHADE  985 

Shadow  is  light  diminished  by  means  of  the  intervention  of  an 
opaque  body.  Shadow  is  the  counterpart  of  the  luminous  ray  cut  off  by 
an  opaque  body. 

This  is  proved  because  the  shaded  ray  is  of  the  same  shape  and  size 
as  was  the  luminous  ray  in  which  this  shadow  projects  itself. 

Windsor:  Drawings  19152  v. 

Demonstration  and  argument  why  of  parts  in  light  some  portions 
are  in  higher  light  than  others. 
[Diagram  | 

Since  it  is  proved  that  every  light  with  fixed  boundaries  emanates 
or  appears  to  emanate  from  a  single  point,  that  part  illuminated  by  it 
will  have  those  portions  in  highest  light  upon  which  the  line  of  radi- 
ance falls,  between  two  equal  angles,  as  is  shown  above  in  the  lines 
a  g,  also  in  a  h,  and  similarly  in  a  I;  and  that  portion  of  the  illuminated 
part  will  be  less  luminous  upon  which  the  line  of  incidence  strikes  at 
two  more  unequal  angles,  as  may  be  seen  in  b  c  and  d;  and  in  this 
way  you  will  also  be  able  to  discern  the  parts  deprived  of  light,  as  may 
be  seen  at  m  and  \. 

When  the  angles  made  by  the  lines  of  incidence  are  more  equal  the 
place  will  have  more  light,  and  where  they  are  more  unequal  it  will  be 
darker. 

I  will  treat  further  of  the  cause  of  the  reflection.

XXXIII 
Perspective 

'Perspective   is   a   rational   demonstration    whereby 

experience  confirms  how  all  things  transmit  their 

images  to  the  eye  by  pyramidal  lines! 

Saxdro!  you  do  not  say  why  these  second  things  seem  lower  than  the 
third.1 

[Diagram  ] 

The  eye  between  two  parallel  lines  will  never  see  them  at  so  great  a 
distance  that  they  meet  in  a  point.  c.a.  120  r.  d 

All  the  cases  of  perspective  are  expressed  by  means  of  the  five  mathe- 
matical terms,  to  wit:  point,  line,  angle,  surface  and  body.  Of  these  the 
point  is  unique  of  its  kind,  and  this  point  has  neither  height  nor 
breadth,  nor  length  nor  depth,  wherefore  we  conclude  that  it  is  indivis- 
ible and  does  not  occupy  space.  A  line  is  of  three  kinds,  namely  straight, 
curved  and  bent,  and  it  has  neither  breadth,  height  nor  depth,  conse- 
quently it  is  indivisible  except  in  its  length;  its  ends  are  two  points. 

An  angle  is  the  ending  of  two  lines  in  a  point,  and  they  are  of  three 
kinds,  namely  right  angles,  acute  angles  and  obtuse  angles. 

Surface  is  the  name  given  to  that  which  is  the  boundary  of  bodies, 
and  it  is  without  depth,  and  in  such  depth  as  it  has  it  is  indivisible  as  is 
the  line  or  point,  being  divided  only  in  respect  of  length  or  breadth. 
There  are  as  many  different  kinds  of  surfaces  as  there  are  bodies  that 
create  them. 

Body  is  that  which  has  height,  breadth,  length  and  depth,  and  in 
all  these  attributes  it  is  divisible.  These  bodies  are  of  infinite  and  varied 
forms.  The  visible  bodies  are  of  two  kinds  only,  of  which  the  first  is

perspective.  References  to  Sandro  [Botticelli]  are  also  to  be  found  in  c.a.  313  r.  b.  p.  555, 
and  Trattato   (Ludwig)   60.

PERSPECTIVE  987 

without  shape  or  any  distinct  or  definite  extremities,  and  these  though 
present  are  imperceptible  and  consequently  their  colour  is  difficult  to 

determine.  The  second  kind  of  visible  bodies  is  that  of  which  the 
surface  defines  and  distinguishes  the  shape. 

The  first  kind,  which  is  without  surface,  is  that  of  those  bodies  which 
are  thin  or  rather  liquid,  and  which  readily  melt  into  and  mingle  with 
other  thin  bodies,  as  mud  with  water,  mist  or  smoke  with  air,  or  the 
element  of  air  with  fire,  and  other  similar  things,  the  extremities  of 
which  are  mingled  with  the  bodies  near  to  them,  whence  by  this  inter- 
mingling their  boundaries  become  confused  and  imperceptible,  for 
which  reason  they  find  themselves  without  surface,  because  they  enter 
into  each  other's  bodies,  and  consequently  such  bodies  are  said  to  be 
without  surface. 

The  second  kind  is  divided  into  two  other  kinds,  namely  transparent 
and  opaque.  The  transparent  is  that  which  shows  its  whole  self  along 
the  whole  of  its  side,  and  nothing  is  hidden  behind  it,  as  is  the  case 
with  glass,  crystal,  water  and  the  like.  The  second  division  of  bodies 
of  which  the  surface  reveals  and  defines  the  shape  is  called  opaque. 

This  it  behoves  us  to  treat  of  at  some  length,  seeing  that  out  of  it  are 
derived  an  infinite  number  of  cases.  c.a.  132  r.  b 


Perspective 

The  air  is  full  of  an  infinite  number  of  images  of  the  things  which 
are  distributed  through  it,  and  all  of  these  are  represented  in  all,  all  in 
one,  and  all  in  each.  Consequently  it  so  happens  that  if  two  mirrors  be 
placed  so  as  to  be  exactly  facing  each  other,  the  first  will  be  reflected 
in  the  second  and  the  second  in  the  first.  Now  the  first  being  reflected 
in  the  second  carries  to  it  its  own  image  together  with  all  the  images 
which  are  represented  in  it,  among  these  being  the  image  of  the  second 
mirror;  and  so  they  continue  from  image  to  image  on  to  infinity,  in 
such  a  way  that  each  mirror  has  an  infinite  number  of  mirrors  within 
it,  each  smaller  than  the  last,  and  one  inside  another. 

By  this  example,  therefore,  it  is  clearly  proved  that  each  thing  trans- 
mits the  image  of  [itself]  to  all  those  places  where  the  thing  itself  is 
visible,  and  so  conversely  this  object  is  able  to  receive  into  itself  all  the 
images  of  the  things  which  are  in  front  of  it. 


988  PERSPECTIVE 

Consequently  the  eye  transmits  its  own  image  through  the  air  to  all 
the  objects  which  are  in  front  of  it,  and  receives  them  into  itself,  that  is 
on  its  surface,  whence  the  understanding  takes  them  and  considers 
them,  and  such  as  it  finds  pleasing,  these  it  commits  to  the  memory. 

So  I  hold  that  the  invisible  powers  of  the  images  in  the  eyes  may 
project  themselves  forth  to  the  object  as  do  the  images  of  the  object  to 
the  eye. 

An  instance  of  how  the  images  of  all  things  are  spread  through  the 
air  may  be  seen  in  a  number  of  mirrors  placed  in  a  circle,  and  they  will 
then  reflect  each  other  for  an  infinite  number  of  times,  for  as  the  image 
of  one  reaches  another  it  rebounds  back  to  its  source,  and  then  becom- 
ing less  rebounds  yet  again  to  the  object,  and  then  returns,  and  so  con- 
tinues for  an  infinite  number  of  times. 

If  at  night  you  place  a  light  between  two  flat  mirrors  which  are 
a  cubit's  space  apart,  you  will  see  in  each  of  these  mirrors  an  infinite 
number  of  lights,  one  smaller  than  another,  in  succession. 

If  at  night  you  place  a  light  between  the  walls  of  a  [room],  every 
part  of  these  walls  will  become  tinged  by  the  images  of  this  light,  and 
all  those  parts  which  are  exposed  to  the  light  will  likewise  be  directly 
lit  by  it;  that  is  when  there  is  no  obstacle  between  them  to  interrupt 
the  transmission  of  the  images. 

This  same  example  is  even  more  apparent  in  the  transmission  of 
solar  rays,  which  all  [pass]  through  all  objects,  and  consequently  into 
each  minutest  part  of  each  object,  and  each  ray  of  itself  conveys  to  its 
object  the  image  of  its  source. 

That  each  body  alone  of  itself  fills  the  whole  surrounding  air  with 
its  images,  and  that  this  same  air  is  [able]  at  the  same  time  to  receive 
into  itself  the  images  of  the  countless  other  bodies  which  are  within  it, 
is  clearly  shown  by  these  instances;  and  each  body  is  seen  in  its  entirety 
throughout  the  whole  of  the  said  atmosphere,  and  each  in  each 
minutest  part  of  the  same,  and  all  throughout  the  whole  of  it  and  all  in 
each  minutest  part;  each  in  all,  and  all  in  every  part.       ca.  138  r.  b

Body  formed  irom  the  perspective  by  Leonardo  Vinci,  disciple  of

This  body  may  be  made  without  the  example  of  any  other  body  but 
merely  with  plain  lines.  c.a.  191  r.  a 

Among  the  various  studies  of  natural  processes,  that  of  light  gives 
most  pleasure  to  those  who  contemplate  it;  and  among  the  noteworthy 
characteristics  of  mathematical  science,  the  certainty  of  its  demonstra- 
tions is  what  operates  most  powerfully  to  elevate  the  minds  of  its 
investigators. 

Perspective  therefore  is  to  be  preferred  to  all  the  formularies  and 
systems  of  the  schoolmen,  for  in  its  province  the  complex  beam  of  light 
is  made  to  show  the  stages  of  its  development,  wherein  is  found  the 
glory  not  only  of  mathematical  but  also  of  physical  science,  adorned  as 
it  is  with  the  flowers  of  both.  And  whereas  its  propositions  have  been 
expanded  with  much  circumlocution  I  will  epitomise  them  with  con- 
clusive brevity,  introducing  however  illustrations  drawn  either  from 
nature  or  from  mathematical  science  according  to  the  nature  of  the 
subject,  and  sometimes  deducing  the  results  from  the  causes  and  at 
other  times  the  causes  from  the  results;  adding  also  to  my  conclusions 
some  which  are  not  contained  in  these,  but  which  nevertheless  are  to  be 
inferred  from  them;  even  as  the  Lord  who  is  the  Light  of  all  things 
shall  vouchsafe  to  reveal  to  me,  who  seek  to  interpret  this  light — and 
consequently  I  will  divide  the  present  work  into  three  parts. 

Light,  when  in  the  course  of  its  incidence  it  sees  things  which  have 
been  turned  against  itself,  retains  their  images  in  part.  This  conclusion 
is  proved  by  results,  because  the  vision  as  it  looks  upon  the  light  has  a 
measure  of  fear.  Even  so  after  the  glance  there  remain  in  the  eye  the 
images  of  vivid  objects,  and  they  make  the  place  of  lesser  light  appear 
in  shadow  until  the  eye  has  lost  the  trace  of  the  impression  of  the 
greater  light.  c.a.  203  r.  a 

METHODS  OF  PERSPECTIVE 

If  you  wish  to  represent  a  figure  in  the  corner  of  a  dwelling  which 
shall  appear  to  have  been  made  in  a  level  place,  get  someone  to  strip 
naked,  and  with  the  light  of  a  candle  make  their  shadow  fall  as  vou 


990  PERSPECTIVE 

wish  in  the  said  corner,  and  draw  the  outline  of  it  with  charcoal;  but 
your  sight  will  wish  to  be  in  the  spot  exactly  through  a  hole  placed 
where  the  light  passed,  and  again  the  light  of  the  window  after  its  work 
will  wish  to  come  by  the  said  line,  so  that  the  walls  joined  together  in 
the  corner  will  not  be  any  darker  on  account  of  the  shadow,  the  one 
than  the  other. 


THE  LIGHT  IN  THE   OPERATION   OF   THE  LAW   OF 
PERSPECTIVE  DOES  NOT  DIFFER  FROM  THE  EYE 

That  the  light  has  not  any  difference  from  the  eye  as  regards  losing 
the  thing  which  is  behind  the  first  object  is  due  to  this  reason:  you 
know  that  in  swiftness  of  movement  and  in  concourse  of  straight  lines 
the  visual  ray  and  the  ray  of  light  resemble  each  other.  As  an  example: 
suppose  you  hold  a  coin  near  to  the  eye,  that  space  which  exists  between 
the  coin  and  the  boundary  of  the  position,  will  be  more  capable  of 
expansion,  in  proportion  as  the  part  of  the  boundary  of  the  position 
which  is  not  visible  to  the  eye  is  the  greater,  and  the  nearer  the  coin 
is  brought  to  the  eye  the  more  the  boundary  of  the  position  will  be 
filled  up. 

OF  LIGHT 

Of  the  eye.  The  same  process  may  be  seen  with  light,  for  as  you 
bring  the  said  coin  nearer  or  remove  it  farther  from  this  light  you  will 
see  the  shadow  on  the  opposite  wall  growing  larger  or  failing,  and  if 
you  wish  an  example  let  it  be  in  this  form :  have  many  bodies  of  differ- 
ent things  placed  in  a  large  room,  then  take  in  your  hand  a  long  pole 
with  a  piece  of  charcoal  at  the  point  and  mark  with  that  on  the  ground 
and  along  the  walls  all  the  outlines  of  the  things1  as  they  appear 
against  the  boundaries  of  the  wall. 

Of  the  light.  Then  at  the  same  distance  and  height  place  a  light,  and 
you  will  see  the  shadows  of  the  said  bodies  covering  as  much  of  the 
wall  as  the  part  that  found  itself  enclosed  within  the  marks  made  by 
the  charcoal  placed  at  the  point  of  the  pole.

Experiment 

If  you  wish  to  sec  a  similar  experiment  place  a  light  upon  a  table, 
and  then  retire  a  certain  distance  away,  and  you  will  see  that  all  the 
shadows  of  the  objects  which  are  between  the  wall  and  the  light  remain 
stamped  with  the  shadow  of  the  form  of  the  objects,  and  all  the  lines  of 
their  length  converge  in  the  point  where  the  light  is. 

Afterwards  bring  your  eye  nearer  to  this  light,  using  the  blade  of  a 
knife  for  a  screen  so  that  the  light  may  not  hurt  your  eye,  and  you  will 
see  all  the  bodies  opposite  without  their  shadows,  and  the  shadows 
which  were  in  the  partitions  of  the  walls  will  be  covered  as  regards  the 
eye  by  the  bodies  which  are  set  before  them.  c.a.  204  v.  b 

Of  things  of  equal  size  situated  at  an  equal  distance  from  the  eye, 
that  will  appear  the  larger  which  is  whiter  in  colour. 

Equal  things  equally  distant  from  the  eye  will  be  judged  by  the  eye 
to  be  'of  equal  size. 

Equal  things  through  being  at  different  distances  from  the  eye  come 
to  appear  of  unequal  size. 

Unequal  things  by  reason  of  their  different  distances  from  the  eye 
may  appear  equal.  c.a.  221  v.  c 

Many  things  of  great  bulk  lose  their  visibility  in  the  far  distance  by 
reason  of  their  colour,  and  many  small  things  in  the  far  distance  retain 
their  visibility  by  reason  of  the  said  colour. 

An  object  of  a  colour  similar  to  that  of  the  air  retains  its  visibility 
at  a  moderate  distance,  and  an  object  that  is  paler  than  the  air  retains  it 
in  the  far  distance,  and  an  object  which  is  darker  than  the  air  ceases  to 
be  visible  at  a  short  distance. 

But  of  these  three  kinds  of  objects  that  will  be  visible  at  the  greatest

the  atmosphere.  c.a.  316  v.  b

mirrors.  c.a.  338  r.  a 

If  you  wish  to  furnish  a  proof  of  how  things  seen  by  the  eye  diminish, 
it  is  necessary  to  fix  the  eye  on  the  centre  of  the  wall,  and  the  curve  of 
the  wall  will  then  give  you  the  true  clearness  of  the  things  seen. 

When  the  cause  of  the  shadow  is  near  the  place  where  it  strikes  and 
distant  from  the  light,  you  will  see  the  shape  of  the  cause  of  the  severed 
rays  clearly  upon  the  wall.  c.a.  353  r.  b

It  is  asked  of  you,  O  painter,  why  the  figures  which  you  draw  on  a

withstanding the  demonstration  of  distance — as  large  as  real  ones, 
which  are  of  the  same  height  as  those  painted  upon  the  wall. 

And  why  [representations  of]  things,  seen  a  short  distance  away, 
notwithstanding  the  distance,  seem  larger  than  the  reality.  Tr.  66  a 

WALL  OF  GLASS 

Perspective  is  nothing  else  than  the  seeing  of  an  object  behind  a  sheet 
of  glass,  smooth  and  quite  transparent,  on  the  surface  of  which  all  the 
things  may  be  marked  that  are  behind  this  glass;  these  things  approach 
the  point  of  the  eye  in  pyramids,  and  these  pyramids  are  cut  by  the  said 
glass.  a  1  v.

PERSPECTIVE  993 

every  ray  which  passes  through  air  of  uniform  density  proceeds  in  a 
direct  line  from  its  cause  to  its  object  or  the  place  at  which  it  strikes. 

OF  THE  DIMINUTION  OF  OBJECTS  AT  VARIOUS  DISTANCES 

A  second  object  as  far  removed  from  the  first  as  the  first  is  from  the 
eye  will  appear  half  the  size  of  the  first,  although  they  are  of  the  same 
size. 

A  small  object  near  at  hand  and  a  large  one  at  a  distance,  when  seen 
between  equal  angles  will  appear  the  same  size. 

I  ask  how  far  away  the  eye  can  see  a  non-luminous  body,  as  for 
instance  a  mountain.  It  will  see  it  to  advantage  if  the  sun  is  behind  it, 
and  it  will  seem  at  a  greater  or  less  distance  away  according  to  the  sun's 
place  in  the  sky.  a  8  v. 

Perspective  is  a  rational  demonstration  whereby  experience  confirms 
how  all  things  transmit  their  images  to  the  eye  by  pyramidal  lines.  By 
pyramidal  lines  I  mean  those  which  start  from  the  extremities  of  the 
surface  of  bodies,  and  by  gradually  converging  from  a  distance  arrive 
at  the  same  point;  the  said  point  being,  as  I  shall  show,  in  this  par- 
ticular case  located  in  the  eye,  which  is  the  universal  judge  of  all 
objects.  I  call  a  point  that  which  cannot  be  divided  up  into  any  parts; 
and  as  this  point  which  is  situated  in  the  eye  is  indivisible,  no  body  can 
be  seen  by  the  eye  which  is  not  greater  than  this  point,  and  this  being 
the  case  it  is  necessary  that  the  lines  which  extend  from  the  object  to 
the  point  should  be  pyramidal.  And  if  anyone  should  wish  to  prove 
that  the  faculty  of  sight  does  not  belong  to  this  point,  but  rather  to  that 
black  spot  which  is  seen  in  the  centre  of  the  pupil,  one  might  reply  to 
him  that  a  small  object  never  could  diminish  at  any  distance,  as  for 
example  a  grain  of  millet  or  panic-seed  or  other  similar  thing,  and  that 
this  thing  which  was  greater  than  the  said  point  could  never  be  entirely 
seen.  a  io  r. 

No  object  can  be  of  so  great  a  size  as  not  to  appear  less  to  the  eye  at  a 
great  distance  than  a  smaller  object  which  is  nearer. 

A  wall  surface  is  a  perpendicular  plane  represented  in  front  of  the 
common  point  at  which  the  concourse  of  the  pyramids  converges.  And 


994  PERSPECTIVE 

this  wall  surface  performs  the  same  function  for  the  said  point  as  a  flat 
piece  of  glass  upon  which  you  drew  the  various  objects  that  you  saw 
through  it,  and  the  things  drawn  would  be  so  much  less  than  the  orig- 
inals, as  the  space  that  existed  between  the  glass  and  the  eye  was  less 
than  that  between  the  glass  and  the  object. 

The  concourse  of  the  pyramids  created  by  the  bodies  will  show  upon 
the  wall  surface  the  variety  of  the  size  and  distance  of  their  causes. 

All  these  planes  which  have  their  extremities  joined  by  perpendicular 
lines  forming  right  angles  must  necessarily,  if  of  equal  size,  be  less 
visible  the  nearer  they  rise  to  the  level  of  the  eye,  and  the  farther  they 
pass  beyond  it  the  more  will  their  real  size  be  seen. 

The  farther  distant  from  the  eye  is  the  spherical  body,  the  more  it  is 
seen.  a  10  v. 

As  soon  as  ever  the  air  is  illuminated  it  is  filled  with  an  infinite  num- 
ber of  images,  caused  by  the  various  substances  and  colours  collected 
together  within  it,  and  of  these  images  the  eye  is  the  target  and  the 
magnet.  a  27  r. 

PRINCIPLE  OF  PERSPECTIVE 

All  things  transmit  their  image  to  the  eye  by  means  of  pyramids; 
the  nearer  to  the  eye  these  are  intersected  the  smaller  the  image  of  their 
cause  will  appear.  a  36  v. 

If  you  should  ask  how  you  can  demonstrate  these  points  to  me  from 
experience,  I  should  tell  you,  as  regards  the  vanishing  point  which 
moves  with  you,  to  notice  as  you  go  along  by  lands  ploughed  in  straight 
furrows,  the  ends  of  which  start  from  the  path  where  you  are  walking, 
you  will  see  that  continually  each  pair  of  furrows  seem  to  approach 
each  other  and  to  join  at  their  ends. 

As  regards  the  point  that  comes  to  the  eye,  it  may  be  comprehended 
with  greater  ease;  for  if  you  look  in  the  eye  of  anyone  you  will  see 
your  own  image  there;  consequently  if  you  suppose  two  lines  to  start 
from  your  ears  and  proceed  to  the  ears  of  the  image  which  you  see  of 
yourself  in  the  eye  of  the  other  person,  you  will  clearly  recognise  that 
these  lines  contract  so  much  that  when  they  have  continued  only  a  little 
way  beyond  your  image  as  mirrored  in  the  said  eye  they  will  touch  one 
another  in  a  point.  a  y]  r.  and  v. 


PERSPECTIVE  995

Perspective  is  of  such  a  nature  that  it  makes  what  is  flat  appear  in 
relief,  and  what  is  in  relief  appear  flat.  a  38  v. 

The  perspective  by  means  of  which  a  thing  is  represented  will  be 
better  understood  when  it  is  seen  from  the  view-point  at  which  it  was 
drawn. 

If  you  wish  to  represent  a  thing  near,  which  should  produce  the  effect 
of  natural  things,  it  is  impossible  for  your  perspective  not  to  appear 
false,  by  reason  of  all  the  illusory  appearances  and  errors  in  proportion 
of  which  the  existence  may  be  assumed  in  a  mediocre  work,  unless 
whoever  is  looking  at  this  perspective  finds  himself  surveying  it  from 
the  exact  distance,  elevation,  angle  of  vision  or  point  at  which  you  were 
situated  to  make  this  perspective.  Therefore  it  would  be  necessary  to 
make  a  window  of  the  size  of  your  face  or  in  truth  a  hole  through 
which  you  would  look  at  the  said  work.  And  if  you  should  do  this, 
then  without  any  doubt  your  work  will  produce  the  effect  of  nature  if 
the  light  and  shade  are  correctly  rendered,  and  you  will  hardly  be  able 
to  convince  yourself  that  these  things  are  painted.  Otherwise  do  not 
trouble  yourself  about  representing  anything,  unless  you  take  your 
view-point  at  a  distance  of  at  least  twenty  times  the  maximum  width 
and  height  of  the  thing  that  you  represent;  and  this  will  satisfy  every 
beholder  who  places  himself  in  front  of  the  work  at  any  angle  what- 
ever. 

If  you  wish  to  see  a  proof  of  this  quickly,  take  a  piece  of  a  staff  like 
a  small  column  eight  times  as  high  as  its  width  without  plinth  or  cap- 
ital, then  measure  off  on  a  flat  wall  forty  equal  spaces  which  are  in 
conformity  with  the  spaces;  they  will  make  between  them  forty  col- 
umns similar  to  your  small  column.  Then  let  there  be  set  up  in  front 
of  the  middle  of  these  spaces,  at  a  distance  of  four  braccia  from  the 
wall,  a  thin  band  of  iron,  in  the  centre  of  which  there  is  a  small  round 
hole  of  the  size  of  a  large  pearl;  place  a  light  beside  this  hole  so  as  to 
touch  it,  then  go  and  place  your  column  above  each  mark  of  the  wall 
and  draw  the  outline  of  the  shadow,  then  shade  it  and  observe  it 
through  the  hole  in  the  iron.  a  40  v.

No  visible  body  can  be  comprehended  and  well  judged  by  human 
eyes,  except  by  the  difference  of  the  background  where  the  extremities 
of  this  body  terminate  and  are  bounded,  and  so  far  as  its  contour  lines 
are  concerned  no  object  will  seem  to  be  separated  from  this  background. 
The  moon,  although  far  distant  from  the  body  of  the  sun,  when  by 
reason  of  eclipses  it  finds  itself  between  our  eyes  and  the  sun,  having 
the  sun  for  its  background  will  seem  to  human  eyes  to  be  joined  and 
attached  to  it.  c  23  r. 

Perspective  comes  to  aid  us  where  judgment  fails  in  things  that

[Of  perspective  in  nature  and  in  art] 

It  is  possible  to  bring  about  that  the  eye  does  not  see  distant  objects 
as  much  diminished  as  they  are  in  natural  perspective,  where  they  are 
diminished  by  reason  of  the  convexity  of  the  eye,  which  is  obliged  to 
intersect  upon  its  surface  the  pyramids  of  every  kind  of  image  that 
approach  the  eye  at  a  right  angle.  But  the  method  that  I  show  here  in 
the  margin  cuts  these  pyramids  at  right  angles  near  the  surface  of  the 
pupil.  But  whereas  the  convex  pupil  of  the  eye  can  take  in  the  whole  of 
our  hemisphere,  this  will  show  only  a  single  star;  but  where  many 
small  stars  transmit  their  images  to  the  surface  of  the  pupil  these  stars 
are  very  small;  here  only  one  will  be  visible  but  it  will  be  large;  and  so 
the  moon  will  be  greater  in  size  and  its  spots  more  distinct.  You  should 
place  close  to  the  eye  a  glass  filled  with  the  water  mentioned  in  [chap- 
ter] four  of  book  113  'Concerning  Natural  Things',  water  which 
causes  things  congealed  in  balls  of  crystalline  glass  to  appear  as  though 
they  were  without  glass. 

Of  the  eye.  Of  bodies  less  than  the  pupil  of  the  eye  that  which  is 
nearest  to  it  will  be  least  discerned  by  this  pupil — and  from  this  expe- 
rience it  follows  that  the  power  of  sight  is  not  reduced  to  a  point. 

But  the  images  of  objects  which  meet  in  the  pupil  of  the  eye  are 
spread  over  this  pupil  in  the  same  way  as  they  are  spread  about  in  the 
air;  and  the  proof  of  this  is  pointed  out  to  us  when  we  look  at  the 


PERSPECTIVE  997 

scarry  heavens  without  fixing  our  gaze  more  upon  one  star  than  upon 
another,  for  then  the  sky  shows  itself  to  us  strewn  with  stars,  and  they 
hear  to  the  eye  the  same  proportions  as  in  the  sky,  and  the  spaces 
between  them  also  are  the  same.  b  15  v. 

Natural  perspective  acts  in  the  opposite  way,  for  the  greater  the 
distance  the  smaller  does  the  thing  seen  appear,  and  the  less  the  distance 
the  larger  it  appears.  But  this  invention  constrains  the  beholder  to  stand 
with  his  eye  at  a  small  hole,  and  then  with  this  small  hole  it  will  be 
seen  well.  But  since  many  eyes  come  together  to  see  at  the  same  time 
one  and  the  same  work  produced  by  this  art,  only  one  of  them  will 
have  a  good  view  of  the  function  of  this  perspective  and  all  the  others 
will  only  see  it  confusedly.  It  is  well  therefore  to  shun  this  compound 
perspective,  and  to  keep  to  the  simple  which  does  not  purport  to  view 
planes  foreshortened  but  as  far  as  possible  in  exact  form. 

And  of  this  simple  perspective  in  which  the  plane  intersects  the 
pyramid  that  conveys  the  images  to  the  eye  that  are  at  an  equal  distance 
from  the  visual  faculty,  an  example  is  afforded  us  by  the  curve  of  the 
pupil  of  the  eye  upon  which  these  pyramids  intersect  at  an  equal  dis- 
tance from  the  visual  faculty.  e  16  r. 


OF  EQUAL  THINGS  THE  MORE  REMOTE  APPEARS  LESS 

The  practice  of  perspective  is  divided  into  [two]  parts,  of  which  the 
first  treats  of  all  the  things  seen  by  the  eye  at  whatsoever  distance,  and 
this  in  itself  shows  all  these  things  diminished  as  the  eye  beholds  them, 
without  the  man  being  obliged  to  stand  in  one  place  rather  than  in 
another,  provided  that  the  wall  does  not  foreshorten  it  a  second  time. 

But  the  second  practice  is  a  combination  of  perspective  made  partly 
by  art  and  partly  by  nature,  and  the  work  done  according  to  its  rules 
has  no  part  that  is  not  influenced  by  natural  and  accidental  perspective. 
Natural  perspective  I  understand  has  to  do  with  the  flat  surface  on 
which  this  perspective  is  represented;  which  surface,  although  it  is 
parallel  to  it  in  length  and  height,  is  constrained  to  diminish  the  distant 
parts  more  than  its  near  ones.  And  this  is  proved  by  the  first  of  what 
has  been  said  above,  and  its  diminution  is  natural. 

Accidental  perspective,  that  is  that  which  is  created  by  art,  acts  in 


998  PERSPECTIVE 

the  contrary  way;  because  it  causes  bodies  equal  in  themselves  to 
increase  on  the  foreshortened  plane,  in  proportion  as  the  eye  is  more 
natural  and  nearer  to  the  plane,  and  as  the  part  of  this  plane  where  it 
is  represented  is  more  remote  from  the  eye.  e  16  v. 

THE  PERSPECTIVE  OF  THE  DISAPPEARANCE  OF  THE 
OUTLINES  OF  OPAQUE  BODIES 

If  the  true  outlines  of  opaque  bodies  become  indistinguishable  at  any 
short  distance  they  will  be  still  more  invisible  at  great  distances;  and 
since  it  is  by  the  outlines  that  the  true  shape  of  each  opaque  body 
becomes  known,  whenever  because  of  distance  we  lack  the  perception 
of  the  whole  we  shall  lack  yet  more  the  perception  of  its  parts  and 
outlines.  e  80  r. 

OF  PAINTING  AND  PERSPECTIVE 

There  are  three  divisions  of  perspective  as  employed  in  painting.  Of 
these  the  first  relates  to  the  diminution  in  the  volume  of  opaque  bodies; 
the  second  treats  of  the  diminution  and  disappearance  of  the  outlines 
of  these  opaque  bodies;  the  third  is  their  diminution  and  loss  of  colour 
when  at  a  great  distance. 

OF  THE  PERSPECTIVE  OF  THE  DIMINUTION  OF  OPAQUE 

BODIES 

Among  opaque  bodies  of  equal  magnitude,  the  diminution  apparent 
in  their  size  will  vary  according  to  their  distance  from  the  eye  which 
sees  them;  but  it  will  be  in  inverse  proportion,  for  at  the  greater  dis- 
tance the  opaque  body  appears  less,  and  at  a  less  distance  this  body  will 
appear  greater,  and  on  this  is  founded  linear  perspective.  And  show 
secondly  how  every  object  at  a  great  distance  loses  first  that  portion  of 
itself  which  is  the  thinnest.  Thus  with  a  horse,  it  would  lose  the  legs 
sooner  than  the  head  because  the  legs  are  thinner  than  the  head,  and  it 
would  lose  the  neck  before  the  trunk  for  the  same  reason.  It  follows 
therefore  that  the  part  of  the  horse  which  the  eye  will  be  able  last  to 
discern  will  be  the  trunk,  retaining  still  its  oval  form,  but  rather  ap- 
proximating to  the  shape  of  a  cylinder,  and  it  will  lose  its  thickness 


PERSPECTIVE  999 

sooner  than  its  length  from  the  second  conclusion  aforsaid.  If  the  eye 
is  immovable  the  perspective  terminates  its  distance  in  a  point;  but  if 
the  eye  moves  in  a  straight  line  the  perspective  ends  in  a  line,  because 
it  is  proved  that  the  line  is  produced  by  the  movement  of  the  point,  and 
our  sight  is  fixed  upon  the  point,  and  consequently  it  follows  that  as  the 
sight  moves  the  point  moves,  and  as  the  point  moves  the  line  is  pro- 
duced, e  80  v. 

Of  objects  of  equal  size  placed  at  equal  distances  from  the  eye  the 
more  luminous  will  appear  the  greater. 

Of  equal  objects  equally  distant  from  the  eye  the  more  obscure  will 
appear  the  less.  f  36  r. 

Of  things  removed  an  equal  distance  from  the  eye  that  will  appear 
to  be  less  diminished  which  was  at  first  more. 

Of  things  removed  from  the  eye  at  an  equal  distance  from  their  first 
position,  that  is  less  diminished  which  at  first  was  more  distant  from 
this  eye. 

And  the  proportion  of  the  diminution  will  be  the  same  as  that  of  the 
distances  at  which  they  were  from  the  eye  before  their  movement. 

f  60  v. 

SIMPLE  PERSPECTIVE 

Simple  perspective  is  that  which  is  made  by  art  upon  a  position 
equally  distant  from  the  eye  in  each  of  its  parts. 

Complex  perspective  is  that  which  is  made  upon  a  position  in  which 
no  two  of  the  parts  are  equally  distant  from  the  eye.  g   13  v. 


PERSPECTIVE 

If  two  similar  and  equal  things  be  placed  one  behind  the  other  at  a 
given  distance,  the  difference  in  their  size  will  appear  greater  in  pro- 
portion as  they  are  nearer  to  the  eye  which  sees  them.  And  conversely 
there  will  appear  less  difference  in  size  between  them  as  they  are 
farther  removed  from  the  eye. 

This  is  proved  by  means  of  the  proportions  that  they  have  between 
their  distances,  for  if  there  are  two  bodies  with  as  great  a  distance  from 
the  eye  to  the  first  as  from  the  first  to  the  second  this  proportion  is 


iooo  PERSPECTIVE 

called  double;  because  if  the  first  is  one  braccio  distant  from  the  eye 
and  the  second  is  at  a  distance  of  two  braccia,  the  second  space  is  double 
the  first,  and  for  this  reason  the  first  body  will  show  itself  double  the 
second.  And  if  you  remove  the  first  to  a  distance  of  a  hundred  braccia 
and  the  second  to  a  hundred  and  one  braccia,  you  will  find  that  the 
first  is  greater  than  the  second  by  the  extent  to  which  a  hundred  is 
less  than  a  hundred  and  one,  and  this  conversely. 

The  same  thing  also  is  proved  by  the  fourth  of  this,  which  says:  in 
the  case  of  equal  things  there  is  the  same  proportion  of  size  to  size  as 
that  of  distance  to  distance  from  the  eye  that  sees  them.  g  29  v. 


DISCOURSE  ON  PAINTING 

Perspective  as  it  concerns  Painting  is  divided  into  three  chief  parts, 
of  which  the  first  treats  of  the  diminution  in  the  size  of  bodies  at  dif- 
ferent distances.  The  second  is  that  which  treats  of  the  diminution  in 
the  colour  of  these  bodies.  The  third  of  the  gradual  loss  of  distinctness 
of  the  forms  and  outlines  of  these  bodies  at  various  distances. 

Perspective  employs  in  distances  two  opposite  pyramids,  one  of  which 
has  its  apex  in  the  eye  and  its  base  as  far  away  as  the  horizon.  The 
other  has  the  base  towards  the  eye  and  the  apex  on  the  horizon.  But  the 
first  is  concerned  with  the  universe,  embracing  all  the  mass  of  the  ob- 
jects that  pass  before  the  eye,  as  though  a  vast  landscape  was  seen 
through  a  small  hole,  the  number  of  the  objects  seen  through  such  a 
hole  being  so  much  the  greater  in  proportion  as  the  objects  are  more 
remote  from  the  eye;  and  thus  the  base  is  formed  on  the  horizon  and 
the  apex  in  the  eye,  as  I  have  said  above. 

The  second  pyramid  has  to  do  with  a  peculiarity  of  landscape,  in 
showing  itself  so  much  smaller  in  proportion  as  it  recedes  farther  from 
the  eye;  and  this  second  instance  of  perspective  springs  from  the  first. 

[Perspective  of  disappearance] 

In  every  figure  placed  at  a  great  distance  you  lose  first  the  knowledge 
of  its  most  minute  parts,  and  preserve  to  the  last  that  of  the  larger 
parts,  losing,  however,  the  perception  of  all  their  extremities;  and  they 
become  oval  or  spherical  in  shape,  and  their  boundaries  are  indistinct.

OF  ORDINARY  PERSPECTIVE 

An  object  of  uniform  thickness  and  colour  seen  against  a  background 
of  various  colours  will  appear  not  to  be  of  uniform  thickness. 

And  if  an  object  of  uniform  thickness  and  of  various  colours  is  seen 
against  a  background  of  uniform  colour,  the  object  will  seem  of  a 
varying  thickness. 

And  in  proportion  as  the  colours  of  the  background,  or  of  the  object 
seen  against  the  background,  have  more  variety,  the  more  will  their 
thickness  seem  to  vary,  although  the  objects  seen  against  the  back- 
ground may  be  of  equal  thickness.  1  17  v. 

A  dark  object  seen  against  a  light  background  will  seem  smaller

If  the  eye  be  in  the  middle  of  a  course  with  two  horses  running  to 
their  goal  along  parallel  tracks,  it  will  seem  to  it  that  they  are  running 
to  meet  one  another. 

This  that  has  been  stated  occurs  because  the  images  of  the  horses 
which  impress  themselves  upon  the  eye  are  moving  towards  the  centre 
of  the  surface  of  the  pupil  of  the  eye.  k  120  [40]  v.

b.m.  134  v. 
[Aerial  perspective'] 

In  the  morning  the  mist  is  thicker  up  above  than  in  the  lower  parts 
because  the  sun  draws  it  upwards;  so  with  high  buildings  the  summit 
will  be  invisible  although  it  is  at  the  same  distance  as  the  base.  And  this 
is  why  the  sky  seems  darker  up  above  and  towards  the  horizon,  and 
does  not  approximate  to  blue  but  is  all  the  colour  of  smoke  and  dust. 

The  atmosphere  when  impregnated  with  mist  is  altogether  devoid  of 
blueness  and  merely  seems  to  be  the  colour  of  the  clouds,  which  turn 
white  when  it  is  fine  weather.  And  the  more  you  turn  to  the  west  the 
darker  you  will  find  it  to  be,  and  the  brighter  and  clearer  towards  the 
east.  And  the  verdure  of  the  countryside  will  assume  a  bluish  hue  in 
the  half-mist  but  will  turn  black  when  the  mist  is  thicker. 

Buildings  which  face  the  west  only  show  their  illuminated  side,  the 
rest  the  mist  hides. 

When  the  sun  rises  and  drives  away  the  mists,  and  the  hills  begin  to 
grow  distinct  on  the  side  from  which  the  mists  are  departing,  they 
become  blue  and  seem  to  put  forth  smoke  in  the  direction  of  the  mists 
that  are  flying  away,  and  the  buildings  reveal  their  lights  and  shadows; 
and  where  the  mist  is  less  dense  they  show  only  their  lights,  and  where 
it  is  more  dense  nothing  at  all.  Then  it  is  that  the  movement  of  the 
mist  causes  it  to  pass  horizontally  and  so  its  edges  are  scarcely  percep- 
tible against  the  blue  of  the  atmosphere,  and  against  the  ground  it  will 
seem  almost  like  dust  rising. 

In  proportion  as  the  atmosphere  is  more  dense  the  buildings  in  a  city 
and  the  trees  in  landscapes  will  seem  more  infrequent,  for  only  the 
most  prominent  and  the  largest  will  be  visible. 

And  the  mountains  will  seem  few  in  number,  for  only  those  will  be 


PERSPECTIVE  1003 

seen  which  are  farthest  apart  from  each  other,  since  at  such  distances 
the  increases  in  the  density  creates  a  brightness  so  pervading  that  the 
darkness  of  the  hills  is  divided,  and  quite  disappears  towards  their 
summits.  In  the  small  adjacent  hills  it  cannot  find  such  foothold,  and 
therefore  they  are  less  visible  and  least  of  all  at  their  bases. 

Darkness  steeps  everything  with  its  hue,  and  the  more  an  object  is 
divided  from  darkness  the  more  it  shows  its  true  and  natural  colour.

Of  things  of  equal  size  that  which  is  farther  away  from  the  eye  will 
appear  of  less  bulk.  Forster  11  15  v. 

OF  PERSPECTIVE 

When  the  eye  turns  away  from  a  white  object  which  is  illuminated 
by  the  sun,  and  goes  to  a  place  where  there  is  less  light,  everything 
there  will  seem  dark.  And  this  happens,  because  the  eye  that  rests  upon 
this  white  illuminated  object  proceeds  to  contract  its  pupil  to  such  an 
extent  that  whatever  the  original  surface  that  was  visible  they  will  have 
lost  more  than  three  quarters  of  it,  and  thus  lacking  in  size  they  will 
also  be  lacking  in  power. 

Though  you  might  say  to  me: — a  small  bird  then  would  see  in  pro- 
portion very  little,  and  because  of  the  smallness  of  its  pupils  the  white 
there  would  appear  black.  To  this  I  should  reply  to  you  that  we  are 
here  paying  attention  to  the  proportion  of  the  mass  of  that  part  of  the 
brain  which  is  devoted  to  the  sense  of  sight,  and  not  to  any  other  thing. 
Or — to  return — this  pupil  of  ours  expands  and  contracts  according  to 
the  brightness  or  darkness  of  its  object,  and  since  it  needs  an  interval 


ioo4  PERSPECTIVE 

of  time  thus  to  expand  and  contract,  it  cannot  see  all  at  once  when 
emerging  from  the  light  and  going  to  the  shade,  nor  similarly  from  the 
shade  to  what  is  illuminated;  and  this  circumstance  has  already  de- 
ceived me  when  painting  an  eye,  and  from  it  I  have  learnt.

Make  oil  from  seed  of  mustard,  and  if  you  wish  to  make  it  more 
easily  mix  the  seed  after  grinding  it  with  oil  of  linseed,  and  put  it  all 
under  a  press.  Forster  in  40  r. 

FOR  STAMPING  MEDALS 

Paste  [is  made]  of  emery  mixed  with  spirits  of  wine,  or  iron  filings 
with  vinegar,  or  ashes  of  walnut-leaves,  or  ashes  of  straw  rubbed  very 
fine. 

The  diamond  is  crushed  [by  being]  wrapped  up  in  lead  and  beaten 
with  a  hammer,  the  lead  being  several  time  spread  out  and  folded  up 
again,  and  it  is  kept  wrapped  up  in  paper  so  that  the  powder  may  not 
be  scattered.  Then  melt  the  lead,  and  the  powder  rises  to  the  surface  of 
the  lead  when  it  has  melted,  and  it  is  afterwards  rubbed  between  two 
plates  of  steel  so  that  it  becomes  a  very  fine  powder;  afterwards  wash 
it  with  aqua  fortis  and  the  black  coating  of  the  iron  will  be  dissolved 
and  will  leave  the  powder  clean. 

Lumps  of  emery  can  be  broken  up  by  placing  them  in  a  cloth  folded 
many  times  and  hitting  it  on  the  side  with  a  hammer;  and  by  this 
means  it  goes  into  flakes  bit  by  bit  and  is  then  easily  crushed;  and  if 
you  place  it  on  the  anvil  you  will  never  break  it  on  account  of  its  size.

tempered  steel  with  a  steel  press,  and  then  place  it  in  aqua  fortis  which 
dissolves  all  the  steel  that  is  eaten  away  and  mingled  with  this  enamel 
and  makes  it  black,  with  result  that  the  enamel  remains  purified  and 
clean. 

If  you  grind  it  upon  porphyry  this  porphyry  is  consumed  and  be- 
comes mingled  with  the  enamel  and  spoils  it,  and  aqua  fortis  will 
never  free  it  from  the  porphyry  because  it  cannot  dissolve  it. 

If  you  wish  to  make  a  beautiful  blue,  dissolve  with  tartar  the  enamel 
you  have  made  and  then  take  off  the  salt.

You  should  commence  with  the  oration  of  Niccolo  Piccinino  to  the

degli  Albizi.  Then  you  should  show  him  first  mounting  his  horse  in

And  the  Patriarch  at  an  early  hour  of  the  morning  ascended  a  hill 
in  order  to  reconnoitre  the  country,  that  is  the  hills,  fields  and  a  valley 
watered  by  a  river;  and  he  saw  Niccolo  Piccinino  approaching  from 
Borgo  San  Sepolcro  with  his  men  in  a  great  cloud  of  dust,  and  having 
discovered  him  he  turned  to  the  captains  of  his  men  and  spoke  with 
them. 

And  having  spoken  he  clasped  his  hands  and  prayed  to  God;  and 
presently  he  saw  a  cloud,  and  from  the  cloud  St.  Peter  emerged  and

Spoke  to  the  Patriarch.  Five  hundred  cavalry  were  despatched  by  the 
Patriarch  to  hinder  or  check  the  enemy's  attack. 

In  the  foremost  troop  was  Francesco,  son  of  Niccolo  Piccinino,  and 
he  arrived  first  to  attack  the  bridge  which  was  defended  by  the 
Patriarch]  ?]  *  and  the  Florentines. 

Behind  the  bridge  on  the  left  he  sent  the  infantry  to  engage  our  men 
who  beat  ofT  the  attack.  Their  leader  was  Micheletto  who  [  .  .  .  ]  was 
the  officer  of  the  watch  at  the  court.  Here  at  this  bridge  there  was  a 
great  fight:  the  enemy  conquer  and  the  enemy  are  repulsed. 

Then  Guido  and  Astorre  his  brother,  lord  of  Faenza,  with  many  of 
their  men,  reformed  and  renewed  the  combat,  and  hurled  themselves 
upon  the  Florentines  with  such  vigour  that  they  regained  possession 
of  the  bridge,  and  pushed  their  advance  as  far  as  the  tents. 

Opposite  to  these  came  Simonetto  with  six  hundred  cavalry  to 
harass  the  enemy,  and  he  drove  them  again  from  the  spot  and  reoc- 
cupied  the  bridge. 

And  behind  him  came  another  company  with  two  thousand 
cavalry,  and  so  for  a  long  time  the  battle  swayed. 

And  then  the  Patriarch  to  throw  disorder  into  the  ranks  of  the 
enemy  sent  forward  Niccolo  da  Pisa  and  Napoleone  Orsino,  a  beard- 
less youth,  and  with  them  a  great  multitude  of  men,  and  then  was 
done  another  great  deed  of  arms. 

And  at  this  time  Niccolo  Piccinino  pushed  up  another  unit  of  his 
followers,  and  this  caused  yet  another  advance  by  our  men;  and  had 
it  not  been  for  the  Patriarch  throwing  himself  into  the  midst  and 
sustaining  his  commanders  by  words  and  deeds  the  enemy  would  have 
driven  them  in  flight. 

And  the  Patriarch  made  them  set  up  certain  pieces  of  artillery  on 
the  hill,  by  means  of  which  he  spread  confusion  among  the  infantry  of 
the  enemy.  And  this  disorder  was  so  great  that  Niccolo  began  to  call 
back  his  son  and  all  his  followers  and  they  started  in  flight  towards 
the  Borgo.  And  at  this  spot  there  occurred  a  great  slaughter  of  men, 
and  none  escaped  save  those  who  were  the  first  to  fly  or  those  who  hid 
themselves.

1From  the  juxtaposition  of  these  two  notes  in  the  manuscript  the  first  may  perhaps

existed  under  the  charge  of  the  sculptor  Bertoldo.  Its  existence  is  referred  to  by  Vasari 
in  his  lives  of  Donatello  and  Torrigiano.  The  fact  of  Leonardo  having  worked  for  a 
time  in  this  garden  is  borne  witness  to  in  the  short  biography  of  him  written  just 
before  the  middle  of  the  sixteenth  century  by  a  Florentine  known  as  the  Anon  mo 
Gaddiano: 

'He  lived  as  a  youth  with  Lorenzo  de'  Medici  II  Magnifico  who  in  order  to  make

1  How  well  the  master's  art  answers  to  nature.  Da  Vinci  might  have  shown  the 
soul  here,  as  he  has  rendered  the  rest.  He  did  not,  so  that  his  picture  might  be  the 
greater  likeness;  for  the  soul  of  the  original  is  possessed  by  II  Moro,  her  lover. 

This  lady's  name  is  Lucrezia,  to  whom  the  gods  gave  all  things  with  lavish  hand. 
Beauty  of  form  was  given  her:  Leonardo  painted  her,  II  Moro  loved  her — one  the 
greatest  of  painters,  the  other  of  princes. 

By  this  likeness  the  painter  injured  Nature  and  the  goddesses  on  high.  Nature 
lamented  that  the  hand  of  man  could  attain  so  much,  the  goddesses  that  immortality 
should  be  bestowed  on  so  fair  a  form,  which  ought  to  have  perished. 

For  II  Moro's  sake  Leonardo  did  the  injury,  and  II  Moro  will  protect  him.  Men

How  the  eye  cannot  discern  the  shapes  of  bodies  within  their 
boundaries  except  by  means  of  shadows  and  lights;  and  there  are  many 
sciences  which  would  be  nothing  without  the  science  of  these  shadows 
and  lights:  as  painting,  sculpture,  astronomy,  a  great  part  of  perspec- 
tive and  the  like. 

As  may  be  shown,  the  sculptor  cannot  work  without  the  help  of 

1  The  reference  is  to  the  antique  bronze  equestrian  statue  representing  Odoacer,  King 
of  the  Goths,  according  to  the  Anonimo  Morelliano,  Gisulf  according  to  Antonio  Campo 
the  historian  of  Cremona,  which  was  removed  by  Charlemagne  from  Ravenna  to  Pavia 
and  stood  in  the  Piazza  del  Duomo  until  the  time  of  its  destruction,  which  occurred  in  a 
revolutionary  outbreak  in  1796.  It  was  called  Regisole,  the  name  being  derived  from  the 
reflections  of  the  sun's  rays  on  the  gilded  bronze.  Petrarch  in  a  letter  to  Boccaccio  says 
of  it  that  'it  was  looked  upon  as  a  masterpiece  of  art  by  all  good  judges'.

shadows  and  lights,  since  without  these  the  material  carved  would 
remain  all  of  one  colour;  and  by  the  ninth  of  this  [book]  it  is  shown 
that  a  level  surface  illumined  by  uniform  light  does  not  vary  in  any 
part  the  clearness  or  obscurity  of  its  natural  colour,  and  this  uni- 
formity of  colour  goes  to  prove  the  uniformity  of  the  smoothness  of 
its  surface.  It  would  follow  therefore  that  if  the  material  carved  were 
not  clothed  by  shadows  and  lights,  which  are  necessitated  by  the 
prominences  of  certain  muscles  and  the  hollows  interposed  between 
them,  the  sculptor  would  not  be  able  uninterruptedly  to  see  the  prog- 
ress of  his  own  work,  and  this  the  work  that  he  is  carving  requires, 
and  so  what  he  fashioned  during  the  day  would  be  almost  as  though 
it  had  been  made  in  the  darkness  of  the  night. 

OF  PAINTING 

Painting,  however,  by  means  of  these  shadows  and  lights  comes  to 
represent  upon  level  surfaces  scenes  with  hollows  and  raised  portions, 
separated  from  each  other  by  different  degrees  of  distance  and  in 
different  aspects.  c.a.  277  v.  a

OF  STATUES 

If  you  wish  to  make  a  figure  of  marble  make  first  one  of  clay,  and 
after  you  have  finished  it  and  let  it  dry,  set  it  in  a  case,  which  should 
be  sufficiently  large  that — after  the  figure  has  been  taken  out — it  can 
hold  the  block  of  marble  wherein  you  purpose  to  lay  bare  a  figure  re- 
sembling that  in  clay.  Then  after  you  have  placed  the  clay  figure  inside 
this  case  make  pegs  so  that  they  fit  exactly  into  holes  in  the  case,  and 
drive  them  in  at  each  hole  until  each  white  peg  touches  the  figure  at 
a  different  spot;  stain  black  such  parts  of  the  pegs  as  project  out  of  the 
case,  and  make  a  distinguishing  mark  for  each  peg  and  for  its  hole,  so 
that  you  may  fit  them  together  at  your  ease.  Then  take  the  clay  model 
out  of  the  case  and  place  the  block  of  marble  in  it,  and  take  away 
from  the  marble  sufficient  for  all  the  pegs  to  be  hidden  in  the  holes  up 
to  their  marks,  and  in  order  to  be  able  to  do  this  better,  make  the  case

so  that  the  whole  of  it  can  be  lifted  up  and  the  bottom  may  still  remain 
under  the  marble;  and  by  this  means  you  will  be  able  to  use  the 
cutting  tools  with  great  readiness.  a  43  r. 


OF  THE  BLOW  OF  SCULPTORS 

Because  the  time  of  the  blow  is  indivisible,  like  the  contact  caused  by 
this  blow,  its  operation  is  of  such  swiftness  that  time  does  not  permit 
this  blow  to  transfer  itself  to  the  foundations  of  the  things  struck  with 
sufficient  swiftness  to  prevent  the  blow  being  already  dead  in  its  upper 
parts,  like  the  mason  who  breaks  a  stone  in  his  hand  with  a  hammer 
without  violence  or  damage  to  the  hand. 

And  this  is  why,  after  the  iron  a  b  has  been  struck  by  the  blow  of 
the  hammer  in  its  upper  part  a,  this  part  has  obeyed  the  nature  of  the 
blow  rather  than  transferred  it  to  its  base  b,  so  that  the  extremity  is 
enlarged  more  than  the  base. 

And  from  this  it  follows  that  sculptors  work  to  better  effect  upon 
their  marbles  when  they  rough-hew  with  a  pointed  hammer  than 
with  a  chisel  struck  by  the  hammer. 

A  sharp  sword  will  also  cut  a  roll  in  the  air.  c  6  v.

When  you  have  finished  building  up  the  figure  you  will  make  the 
statue  with  all  its  surface  measurements.  Quaderni  in  3  r. 

Some  have  erred  in  teaching  sculptors  to  surround  the  limbs  of  their 
figures  with  wires,  as  though  believing  that  these  limbs  were  of  equal 
roundness  at  each  part  at  which  they  were  surrounded  by  these  wires.

.  .  .  the  cold  will  have  sufficient  thickness  to  touch  the  plaster,  and 
you  pour  out  the  rest  and  fill  with  plaster  and  then  break  the  mould, 
and  put  the  iron  pins  across,  boring  through  the  wax  and  plaster,  and 
then  clean  the  wax  at  your  leisure;  afterwards  put  it  in  a  case,  and 
put  a  mould  of  plaster  over  it,  leaving  the  air  holes  and  the  mouth  for 
the  casting.  Through  this  mouth  turn  the  mould  upside  down,  and 
after  it  has  been  heated  you  will  be  able  to  draw  out  the  wax  contained 
within  it;  and  you  will  be  able  to  fill  up  the  vacuum  which  remains 
with  your  liquefied  material,  and  the  thing  cast  will  become  hollow. 
But  in  order  to  prevent  the  plaster  from  becoming  broken  while  being 
rebaked  you  must  place  within  it  what  you  know  of.       c.a.  352  r.  c

HOW  CASTS  OUGHT  TO  BE  POLISHED 

You  should  make  a  bunch  of  iron  wire  as  thick  as  fine  string  and 
scrub  them  with  it  with  water,  but  keeping  a  tub  beneath  so  that  it 
may  not  cause  mud  below. 

HOW  TO  REMOVE  THE  ROUGH  EDGES  OF  THE  BRONZE 

You  should  make  an  iron  rod  which  may  be  of  the  shape  of  a  large 
chisel,  and  rub  it  along  the  edges  which  remain  upon  the  casts  of  the 
guns  and  which  are  caused  by  the  joins  in  the  mould;  but  see  that  the 
rod  is  a  good  weight  and  let  the  strokes  be  long  and  sweeping.

TO  FACILITATE  THE  MELTING 

First  alloy  part  of  the  metal  in  the  crucible  and  then  put  it  in  the 
furnace:  this  being  in  a  molten  state  will  make  a  beginning  in  the 
melting  of  the  copper. 

TO  GUARD  AGAINST  THE  COPPER  COOLING  IN  THE 

FURNACE 

When  the  copper  begins  to  cool  in  the  furnace  proceed  instantly  as 
soon  as  you  see  this  to  slice  it  up  with  a  stirring  pole  while  it  is  in  a 
paste,  or  if  it  has  become  entirely  cold,  cut  it  as  you  would  lead  with 
broad  large  chisels. 

FOR  THE  MAKING  OF  A  LARGE  CAST 

If  you  have  to  make  a  cast  of  a  hundred  thousand  pounds,  make  it 
with  five  furnaces  with  two  thousand  pounds  for  each,  or  as  much  as 
three  thousand  pounds  at  most.  Tr.  47  a 

HOW  THE  BOARD  SHOULD  BE  PLACED  WHICH  SUPPORTS 

THE  MORTAR 

The  board  that  serves  as  a  guide  to  the  shape  of  the  mortar  ought 
therefore  to  be  reduplicated  from  the  centre  backwards  by  the  breadth 
of  a  great  plank,  to  the  end  that  it  should  not  become  twisted,  and 
where  this  board  has  the  impress  of  the  frames  and  form  of  the  cannon 
is  the  face  not  the  edge,  and  when  you  add  the  tallow  burnish  this 
face  with  a  pig's  tooth  so  that  it  may  be  solid,  and  let  the  tallow  be 
finely  strained  in  order  that  as  it  turns  it  may  not  make  marks. 

WHAT  TO  DO  IN  ORDER  TO  BREAK  UP  A  LARGE  MASS  OF 

BRONZE 

If  you  wish  to  break  a  large  mass  of  bronze  suspend  it  first,  then 
make  a  wall  round  it  on  the  four  sides  in  the  shape  of  a  hod  for  bricks, 
and  make  a  great  fire  there;  and  when  it  is  quite  red-hot  give  it  a  blow 
with  a  great  weight  raised  above  it  and  do  this  with  great  force.

branches  of  the  courses  when  they  also  are  cast  ought  to  be  divided 
witn  small  plates  of  iron  covered  with  earth  before  they  are  fastened.

HOW  TO  MAKE  LEAD  COMBINE  WITH  OTHER  METAL 

If  you  wish  for  the  sake  of  economy  to  put  lead  with  the  metal,  and 
in  order  to  lessen  the  amount  of  the  tin  which  is  necessary,  first  alloy 
the  lead  with  the  tin  and  then  put  above  the  molten  copper. 

OF  A  NECESSITY  FOR  MELTING  IN  A  FURNACE 
The  furnace  should  be  between  four  pillars  with  strong  foundations. 

OF  THE  THICKNESS  OF  THE  COATING 

The  coating  ought  not  to  exceed  the  thickness  of  two  fingers,  and  it 
ought  to  be  laid  on  in  four  thicknesses  over  the  fine  clay  and  then  well 
prepared,  and  it  should  be  annealed  only  on  the  inside  and  then  given 
a  fine  dressing  of  ashes  and  cattle  dung. 

OF  THE  THICKNESS  OF  THE  MORTAR 

The  mortar  ought  to  carry  a  ball  of  six  hundred  pounds  and  more, 
and  by  this  rule  you  will  take  the  measure  of  the  diameter  of  the  ball 
and  divide  it  in  six  parts,  and  one  of  these  parts  will  be  its  thickness 
at  the  muzzle,  and  it  will  always  be  half  at  the  breech.  And  if  the  ball 
is  to  be  of  seven  hundred  pounds  one  seventh  of  the  diameter  of  the 
ball  will  be  its  thickness  at  the  muzzle,  and  if  the  ball  is  to  be  eight 


CASTING  1023 

hundred  it  will  be  the  eighth  of  its  diameter  at  the  muzzle,  and  if 
nine  hundred  one  eighth  and  one  half  of  it,  and  if  one  thousand  one 
ninth. 

OF  THE  LENGTH  OF  THE  TUBE  OF  THE  MORTAR 

If  you  wish  it  to  throw  a  ball  of  stone,  make  the  length  of  the  tube 
as  six  or  up  to  seven  times  the  diameter  of  the  ball;  and  if  the  ball  is 
to  be  of  iron  make  this  tube  up  to  twelve  times  the  ball,  and  if  the  ball 
is  to  be  of  lead  make  it  up  to  eighteen  times.  I  mean  when  the  mortar 
is  to  have  its  mouth  fitted  to  receive  within  it  six  hundred  pounds  of 
*cone  ball  and  over. 


OF  THE  THICKNESS  OF  SMALL  CANNON 

The  thickness  of  small  cannon  at  the  muzzle  ought  not  to  exceed 
from  a  third  to  a  half  of  the  diameter  of  the  ball,  nor  the  length  from 
thirty  to  thirty  six  times  its  diameter.  Tr.  49  a 


OF  LUTING  THE  FURNACE  ON  THE  INSIDE 

The  furnace  ought  before  you  put  the  metal  in  it  to  be  luted  with 
earth  from  Valenza,  and  over  that  ashes. 


OF  RESTORING  THE  METAL  WHEN  IT  SEEMS  ON  THE 
POINT  OF  COOLING 

When  you  see  that  the  bronze  is  on  the  point  of  becoming  congealed 
take  wood  of  the  willow  cut  into  small  chips  and  make  up  the  fire 
with  it. 

THE  CAUSE  OF  ITS  CONGEALING 

I  say  the  cause  of  this  congealing  is  often  derived  from  there  being 
loo  much  fire  and  also  from  the  wood  being  only  half-dried. 

TO  KNOW  THE  CONDITION  OF  THE  FIRE 

You  will  know  when  the  fire  is  good  and  suitable  by  the  clear  flames, 
and  if  you  see  the  points  of  these  flames  turbid  and  ending  in  much 


io24  CASTING 

smoke  do  not  trust  it,  and  especially  when  you  have  the  molten  metal 
almost  in  fluid  state. 


WHAT  KINDS  OF  WOOD  ARE  SUITABLE 

Wood  is  suitable  when  it  is  the  young  willow,  or  if  willow  cannot  be 
procured  get  alder,  and  let  each  branch  be  young  and  well  dried. 


OF  ALLOYING  THE  METAL 

The  metal  used  for  bombards  must  invariably  be  made  with  six  nr 
even  eight  parts  to  a  hundred,  that  is  six  parts  of  tin  to  one  hundred 
of  copper,  but  the  less  you  put  in  the  stronger  will  be  the  bombard. 

WHEN  THE  TIN  SHOULD  BE  ADDED  TO  THE  COPPER 

The  tin  should  be  put  with  the  copper  when  you  have  the  coppet 
changed  into  a  fluid  state. 

HOW  THE  PROCESS  OF  MELTING  MAY  BE  EXPEDITED 

You  can  expedite  the  process  of  melting  when  the  copper  is  two- 
thirds  changed  to  a  fluid  state.  With  a  chestnut  rod  you  will  then  be 
able  frequently  to  manage  to  stir  the  remainder  of  the  copper  which 
is  still  in  one  piece  amid  the  melted  part.  Tr.  50  a 

THE  FINE  EARTH  OF  THE  BOMBARDS 

Take  the  dust  of  wool  clippings  and  fix  it  on  a  wall  in  thin  plaster 
so  that  it  drives  well.  Then  pound  it  and  sift  in  fine  powder,  and  to 
fifty  parts  of  this  powder  add  ten  parts  of  brick,  not  over-baked 
and  well  pounded  and  sifted,  also  a  small  quantity  of  fine  wool  clip- 
pings or  fustian  cloth;  and  then  to  this  compound  add  six  parts  of 
ashes  which  you  will  sift  when  moistened  with  water  well  salted;  and 
this  you  will  apply  liquid  and  thin  two  or  three  times  with  a  plasterer's 
brush,  leaving  it  every  time  to  dry  without  fire.  Also  it  would  be  ad- 
visable to  add  first  to  this  mixture  ashes  of  burnt  ox-dung  moistened 
with  salt  water.

The  frames  should  be  made  almost  to  the  limit  of  the  cord  as  though 
[one  were  winding]  a  peg-top,  and  above  this  the  frames  should  be

THE  FRAME 

The  frame  of  the  tail  ought  to  have  as  its  final  covering  a  square  in

apply  ashes  of  ox-dung  with  salt  water  over  the  said  frame. 

OF  DIRECTING  THE  FRAME 

The  frame  should  first  be  put  in  the  trench  with  grappling-hooks  as 
you  saw  before,  then  annealed  little  by  little,  emerging  in  the  manner

NOTES  ON  USE  OF  'SAGOMA' 1 

Let  the  plumb-line  be  extended  in  two  directions  opposite  to  the 
centre  of  the  poles  a  c,  and  let  the  plane  surface  be  formed  of  plaster 
(MS.  osseg^=  gesso)  little  by  little  under  the  movement  of  the 
'sagoma'. 

And  when  the  pavement  is  entirely  finished  the  whole  should  be 
corrected  again  minutely  with  the  'sagoma';  and  this  'sagoma'  when 
used  on  the  prepared  surface  (MS.  otasseg  =  gessato)  should  be  used 
with  the  greatest  possible  care.  g  14  r. 

[Of  friction  of  the  sagoma] 

The  friction  of  the  polishing  instrument  against  its  surface  ought 
not  to  be  done  with  the  edge  of  the  instrument,  except  when  first  pre- 
paring the  said  surface.  But  when  it  is  necessary  to  refine  this  surface 
then  the  instrument  ought  not  to  be  of  less  width  than  half  the  sur- 
face. This  may  be  proved:  suppose  /  e  d  c  to  be  the  said  polishing  in- 
strument and  f  e  n  m  the  smoothed  surface.  I  maintain  that  if  this 
polishing  instrument  were  to  have  only  one  cutting  edge,  as  in  d  c 
with  a  b,  it  would  have  far  greater  weight  when  the  perpendicular  line 
was  upon  the  part  d  c  of  the  smoothed  surface  than  when  it  was  on 
the  position  /  e  of  the  said  surface.  And  for  this  reason  it  would  wear 
away  the  rubbed  parts  much  more  if  it  were  straight  than  if  it  were 
slanting.  And  the  concaveness  of  this  surface  would  be  unequal,  such 
inequality  as  cannot  be  formed  by  the  great  contact  of  the  polishing 
instrument  with  the  surface  which  it  polishes. 

But  it  would  be  better  that  the  instrument  and  the  surface  should 
be  the  equal  the  one  of  the  other,  for  when  one  of  the  sides  of  the  in- 
strument was  in  the  middle  of  the  said  surface  its  extremity  would 
receive  all  the  accidental  weight  of  this  instrument.

But  the  polishing  instrument  with  one  cutting  edge  is  necessary, 
merely  in  order  to  give  the  form  to  its  smoothed  surface  by  means  oi

Because  it  is  necessary  that  in  proportion  as  the  said  instrument  is 
lowered  so  it  wears  itself  away,  and  as  after  having  been  lowered  it 
becomes  very  strong  it  is  therefore  necessary  to  make  the  pulleys  with 
nuts  so  that  screws  turn  within  them,  and  that  it  shuts  and  opens  be- 
tween a  c  as  b  shows  between  a  c,  and  that  these  rings  which  form

USE  OF  THE  SAGOMA

be  applied  to  the  moist  surface,  and  go  over  it  with  the  sieve;  use  the 
mould  two  or  three  times,  then  expose  it  to  the  furnace,  and  when  it 
acquires  lustre  immediately  apply  the  mould  while  it  is  hot. 

The  centre  of  the  revolution  of  the  mould  upon  the  structure  ought

In  the  polishing  instrument  there  is  a  space  left  in  order  to  be  able  to 
insert  the  lead  moulding,  and  so  that  one  may  be  able  to  change  these 
from  time  to  time  as  they  are  consumed.  And  so  with  the  emery,  one 
will  guide  the  'male'  of  the  fired  surface  to  perfection,  and  upon  this 
one  will  afterwards  print  the  copper  (MS.  emar  =  rame)  after  it  has 
been  made  absolutely  smooth.

The  motive  power  is  Neptune. 

This  will  keep  the  object  to  be  polished  below  and  the  polishing  in- 
strument above;  and  the  pole  will  find  itself  above,  and  so  this  pole  not 
being  weighed  down  as  is  that  of  the  instrument  represented  above 
will  come  to  maintain  itself,  and  as  it  is  not  able  to  consume  itself  the 
process  will  be  complete. 

Moreover  the  thing  polished  will  support  above  itself  the  substance 
which  polishes  it,  and  the  polishing  instrument  being  of  lead  may  be 
recast  and  adjusted  many  times. 

The  mould  may  be  of  Venus,  Jupiter  or  Saturn,  and  often  cast  back 
into  the  lap  of  its  mother,  and  it  may  be  worked  over  with  fine  emery; 
and  the  mould  may  be  of  Venus  and  Jupiter  plastered  over  Venus. 

But  first  you  will  put  to  the  test  Venus  and  Mercury  mixed  with 
Jupiter,  and  manage  so  that  Mercury  may  escape,  and  then  roll  them 
up  tightly  so  that  Venus  and  Jupiter  become  blended  in  Neptune  as 
thinly  as  possible.

This  ought  to  be  upside  down,  in  order  that  the  mould  may  weigh

not  to  have  the  weight  upon  itself;  and  apart  from  this  the  polishing 
process  will  serve  to  receive  and  support  it,  as  I  have  said  in  the  first

OF  MAKING  THE  MOULD  IN  PIECES 

Mark  upon  the  horse  when  finished  all  the  pieces  of  the  mould  with 
which  you  wish  to  cover  the  horse,  and  after  the  clay  has  been  laid  on 
cut  it  to  correspond  in  every  piece,  so  that  when  the  mould  is  finished 
you  can  take  it  off  and  then  replace  it  in  its  first  position  with  its 
catches  by  the  countersigns. 

The  square  block  a  b  will  go  between  the  cover  and  the  core,  that  is 
in  the  hollow  space  where  the  liquefied  bronze  is  to  be;  and  these 
square  blocks  of  bronze  will  keep  the  spaces  between  the  mould  and 
the  cover  at  an  equal  distance,  and  for  this  reason  these  blocks  are  of 
great  importance. 

The  clay  must  be  mixed  with  sand. 

Take  wax  to  give  back  and  to  pay  for  what  has  been  used.

continuous,  being  warmer  at  the  beginning  than  at  the  end,  and  very 
often  it  is  overlooked  through  the  carelessness  of  those  in  charge  of  it. 

The  herbage  of  the  little  brooks  ought  to  be  cut  frequently  so  that 
the  clearness  of  the  water  may  be  seen  upon  its  shingly  bed,  and  only 
those  plants  should  be  left  which  serve  the  fishes  for  food,  such  as 
watercress  and  other  plants  like  these. 

The  fish  should  be  such  as  will  not  make  the  water  muddy,  that  is  to 
say  eels  must  not  be  put  there  nor  tench,  nor  yet  pike  because  they 
destroy  the  other  fish. 

By  means  of  the  mill  you  will  make  many  water-conduits  through 
the  house,  and  springs  in  various  places,  and  a  certain  passage  where, 
when  anyone  passes,  from  all  sides  below  the  water  will  leap  up,  and 
so  it  will  be  there  ready  in  case  anyone  should  wish  to  give  a  shower- 
bath  from  below  to  the  women  or  others  who  shall  pass  there. 

Overhead  we  must  construct  a  very  fine  net  of  copper  which  will 
cover  over  the  garden  and  shut  in  beneath  it  many  different  kinds  of 
birds,  and  so  you  will  have  perpetual  music  together  with  the  scents  of 
the  blossom  of  the  citrons  and  the  lemons.

[The  dimensions  of  a  temple] 

You  ascended  by  twelve  flights  of  steps  to  the  great  temple,  which 
is  eight  hundred  feet  in  circumference  and  is  built  in  the  shape  of  an 
octagon.  At  the  eight  corners  were  eight  large  plinths  a  braccio  and  a 
half  in  height  and  three  in  width  and  six  in  length  at  the  base,  with  an 
angle  in  the  centre  which  served  as  the  foundation  for  eight  large 
pillars  that  rose  to  a  height  of  twenty-four  braccia  above  the  base  of  the 
plinth,  and  on  top  of  these  stood  eight  capitals  three  braccia  each  [in 
length]  and  six  wide.  Above  these  followed  architrave,  frieze  and 
cornice,  four  braccia  and  a  half  in  height,  carried  on  in  a  straight  line 
from  one  pillar  to  another,  and  thus  it  surrounded  the  temple  with  a 
circuit  of  eight  hundred  braccia;  between  each  of  the  pillars,  as  a 
support  to  this  entablature,  there  stood  ten  large  columns  of  the  same 
height  as  the  pillars,  three  braccia  thick  above  their  bases  which  were 
one  braccio  and  a  half  in  height. 

You  ascended  to  this  temple  by  twelve  flights  of  steps,  the  temple 
being  upon  the  twelfth,  built  in  the  shape  of  an  octagon,  and  above 
each  angle  rose  a  large  pillar,  and  between  the  pillars  were  interposed 
ten  columns  of  the  same  height  as  the  pillars,  which  rose  twenty-eight 
and  a  half  braccia  above  the  pavement.  At  this  same  height  were  placed 
architrave,  frieze  and  cornice,  which  formed  a  circuit  round  the  temple, 
eight  hundred  braccia  in  length  and  of  uniform  height.  Within  this 
circuit  at  the  same  level  towards  the  centre  of  the  temple  at  a  distance 
of  twenty-four  braccia  rise  pillars  and  columns,  corresponding  to  the 
eight  pillars  of  the  angles  and  the  columns  placed  in  the  facade.  And 
they  rise  to  the  same  height  as  those  already  mentioned,  and  above 
these  pillars  the  continuous  architrave  goes  back  towards  the  pillars 
and  columns  first  spoken  of.  c.a.  285  r.  c 

Our  ancient  architects  or  such  .  .  .  commencing  first  of  all  with  the

builders  and  constructors  of  great  cities,  and  of  fortresses  and  buildings

c.a.  325  r.  b 

An  inverted  arch  is  better  for  making  a  support  than  an  ordinary 
one,  because  the  inverted  arch  finds  a  wall  below  it  which  resists  its 
weakness,  while  the  ordinary  arch  finds  where  it  is  weakest  nothing 
but  air.  Tr.  13  a 

WHAT  IS  AN  ARCH? 

An  arch  is  nothing  other  than  a  strength  caused  by  two  weaknesses; 
for  the  arch  in  buildings  is  made  up  of  two  segments  of  a  circle,  and 
each  of  these  segments  being  in  itself  very  weak  desires  to  fall,  and  as 
the  one  withstands  the  downfall  of  the  other  the  two  weaknesses  are 
converted  into  a  single  strength. 


OF  THE  NATURE  OF  THE  WEIGHT. IN  ARCHES 

When  once  the  arch  has  been  set  up  it  remains  in  a  state  of  equi- 
librium, for  the  one  side  pushes  the  other  as  much  as  the  other  pushes 
it;  but  if  one  of  the  segments  of  the  circle  weighs  more  than  the  other 
the  stability  is  ended  and  destroyed,  because  the  greater  weight  will 
subdue  the  less.  a  50  r.

A  way  of  a  fortress  with  double  moat.  And  the  spurs  which  pass

The    roads    [marked]    m    are    six    braccia    higher    than    the    roads 

[marked]  p  s,  and  each  road  ought  to  be  twenty  braccia  wide  and  have 


ARCHITECTURE  1041 

a  fall  of  half  a  braccio  from  the  edges  to  the  centre.  And  in  this  centre 
at  every  braccio  there  should  be  an  opening  one  braccio  long  and  of 
the  width  of  a  finger,  through  which  rain-water  may  drain  off  into 
holes  made  at  the  level  of  the  roads  p  s.  And  on  each  side  of  the  ex- 
tremity of  the  width  of  this  road  there  should  be  an  arcade  six 
braccia  broad  resting  on  columns.  And  know  that  if  anyone  wishes 
to  go  through  the  whole  place  by  the  high-level  roads,  he  will  be  able 
to  use  them  for  this  purpose,  and  so  also  if  anyone  wishes  to  go  by  the 
low-level  roads. 

The  high-level  roads  are  not  to  be  used  by  waggons  or  vehicles  such 
as  these  but  are  solely  for  the  convenience  of  the  gentlefolk.  All  carts 
and  loads  for  the  service  and  convenience  of  the  common  people  should 
be  confined  to  the  low-level  roads. 

One  house  has  to  turn  its  back  on  another,  leaving  the  low-level 
road  between  them.  The  doors  n  serve  for  the  bringing  in  of  provisions 
such  as  wood  and  wine  and  suchlike  things.  The  privies,  the  stables 
and  suchlike  noisome  places  are  emptied  by  underground  passages, 
situated  at  a  distance  of  three  hundred  braccia  from  one  arch  to  the 
next,  each  passage  receiving  its  light  through  the  openings  in  the  streets 
above.  And  at  every  arch  there  should  be  a  spiral  staircase;  it  should  be 
round  because  in  the  corners  of  square  ones  nuisances  are  apt  to  be 
committed.  At  the  first  turn  there  should  be  a  door  of  entry  into  the 
privies  and  public  urinals,  and  this  staircase  should  enable  one  to  de- 
scend from  the  high-level  to  the  low-level  road. 

The  high-level  roads  begin  outside  the  gates,  and  when  they  reach 
them  they  have  attained  a  height  of  six  braccia.  The  site  should  be 
chosen  near  to  the  sea  or  some  large  river,  in  order  that  the  impurities 
of  the  city  which  are  moved  by  water  may  be  carried  far  away.

f  Castle  of  Milan  ] 
[  With  drawing] 

The  moats  of  the  castle  of  Milan  within  the  Garland  are  thirty 
braccia;  the  ramparts  are  sixteen  braccia  high  and  forty  wide,  and  this 
is  the  Garland. 

The  outer  walls  are  eight  braccia  thick  and  forty  high,  and  the  inner 
walls  of  the  castle  are  sixty  braccia,  which  would  please  me  entirely  if 
it  were  not  that  I  should  wish  to  see  that  the  bombardiers  who  are  in 
the  walls  of  the  Garland  do  not  issue  forth  in  the  secret  inner  way,  that 
is  in  Sy  but  lower  themselves  one  at  a  time  as  appears  in  m  f. 

Since  good  bombardiers  always  aim  at  the  embrasures  of  fortresses, 
and  can  if  they  break  a  single  embrasure  in  the  said  Garland  enter  like 
cats  through  this  breach  and  make  themselves  masters  of  all  the  towers, 
walls,  and  secret  passages  of  the  Garland,  therefore  if  the  embrasures 
are  m  f  and  it  shall  come  about  that  a  mortar  bursts  one  of  these  em- 
brasures and  the  enemy  enters  within,  they  will  not  be  able  to  pass 
farther  but  may  be  beaten  back  and  driven  away  by  a  soldier  stationed 
in  the  machicolations  above;  and  the  passage  /  ought  to  be  continued 
through  all  the  walls  from  three  quarters  downwards  and  without  hav- 
ing any  exit  above,  either  in  the  walls  or  the  towers,  except  that  by 
which  one  enters,  which  will  have  its  beginning  within  the  fortress; 
and  the  above-mentioned  secret  passage  /  ought  not  to  have  any  air- 
hole on  the  outside  but  to  get  its  light  on  the  side  of  the  fortress 
through  the  frequent  loopholes.  b  36  v.

vide  its  width  in  three  parts,  its  length  does  not  matter;  and  these  three 
divisions  should  be  equal,  each  being  six  braccia  wide  and  ten  high. 
The  centre  part  should  be  for  the  use  of  the  master  of  the  stable,  the 
two  at  the  sides  for  the  horses,  each  requiring  for  width  three  braccia 
and  for  length  six  braccia,  and  being  half  a  braccio  higher  in  front  than 
behind. 

The  manger  should  be  two  braccia  from  the  ground,  the  beginning 
of  the  rack  three  braccia,  and  the  top  of  it  four  braccia. 

To  attempt  however  to  keep  my  promise,  namely  to  make  the  said 
place  contrary  to  the  usual  custom  clean  and  neat:  as  to  the  upper 
portion  of  the  stable,  that  is,  where  the  hay  is,  this  part  should  have  at 
its  outer  end  a  window  six  ["  ?  braccia]  high  and  six  wide,  by  which 
hay  can  easily  be  brought  up  to  the  loft  as  is  shown  in  the  machine  E\ 
and  this  should  be  erected  in  a  place  six  braccia  in  breadth  and  as  long 
as  the  stable,  as  is  shown  in  K  p.  The  other  two  parts,  which  have  the 
first  between  them,  are  each  divided  into  two  parts.  The  two  towards 
the  hay  are  four  braccia,  and  are  entirely  for  the  use  and  passage  of  the 
stable  attendants;  the  other  two  which  extend  to  the  outside  walls  are 
two  braccia,  as  is  shown  in  S  R,  and  these  are  for  the  purpose  of  giving 
the  hay  to  the  manger,  by  means  of  funnels  narrow  at  the  top,  and 
broad  above  the  mangers,  so  that  the  hay  may  not  be  stopped  on  the 
way.  They  should  be  well  plastered  and  cleaned,  as  they  are  repre- 
sented where  it  is  marked  4  /  s.  In  order  that  the  horses  may  be  given 
water  the  troughs  should  be  of  stone,  so  made  as  to  be  able  to  be  un- 
covered as  are  boxes  by  raising  their  lids.  b  39  r.

The  first  and  most  essential  requisite  is  stability. 

As  regards  the  foundations  of  the  component  parts  of  temples  and 
other  public  buildings,  their  depths  should  bear  the  same  relation  one 
to  another  as  do  the  weights  which  are  to  rest  upon  them. 

Each  section  of  the  depth  of  the  earth  in  a  given  space  is  arranged 
in  layers,  the  layers  having  each  a  heavier  and  a  lighter  part,  the  heavier 
being  at  the  bottom. 

This  comes  from  the  fact  that  these  layers  are  formed  by  the  sedi- 
ment from  the  water  discharged  into  the  sea  by  the  current  of  the 
rivers  which  are  poured  into  it. 

The  heaviest  part  of  this  sediment  was  the  part  that  was  discharged 
first,  and  this  process  continued. 

And  this  is  the  action  of  the  water  when  it  becomes  stationary,  and 
it  is  carrying  it  away  at  first  where  it  moves. 

These  layers  of  soil  are  visible  in  the  banks  of  rivers  which  in  their 
continuous  course  have  sawn  through  and  divided  one  hill  from  an- 
other in  a  deep  defile,  wherein  the  level  of  the  waters  has  receded  from 
the  shingle  of  the  banks,  and  this  has  caused  the  substance  to  become 
dry  and  to  be  changed  to  hard  stone,  especially  such  mud  as  was  of 
the  finest  texture.  And  this  leads  us  to  conclude  that  each  part  of  the 
earth's  surface  was  once  the  centre  of  the  earth,  and  so  conversely.

OF  CRACKS  IN  WALLS  WIDE  AT  THE  BASE  AND  NARROW 
AT  THE  TOP  AND  THEIR  CAUSE 

A  wall  will  always  crack  when  it  does  not  dry  uniformly  at  the  same 
time. 

A  wall  of  uniform  thickness  does  not  all  become  dry  at  the  same 
time  unless  it  is  in  contact  with  an  equal  medium;  thus  if  a  wall  be  so 
built  that  part  of  it  touches  a  damp  mound  while  the  rest  is  exposed 
to  the  atmosphere,  this  latter  part  will  become  somewhat  contracted 
while  the  damp  portion  will  retain  its  original  size. 

For  the  part  which  becomes  dried  by  the  atmosphere  draws  itself 
together  and  shrinks,  and  the  part  in  contact  with  the  damp  does  not 
become  dry,  and  the  dry  part  readily  breaks  away  from  the  damp  part 
as  this  has  not  the  coherence  necessary  for  it  to  follow  the  movement 
of  the  part  that  is  in  process  of  becoming  dry. 

OF  CRACKS  IN  THE  FORM  OF  ARCHES  WIDE  ABOVE 
AND  NARROW  BELOW 

Those  arched  cracks  wide  above  and  narrow  below  have  their 
origin  in  walled-up  doorways,  which  contract  more  in  length  than  in 
width  in  proportion  as  their  height  is  greater  than  their  breadth,  and 
as  the  joins  of  the  mortar  are  more  numerous  in  the  height  than  in 
the  breadth.  b.m.  138  r. 

When  either  a  complete  dome  or  a  half  dome  is  vanquished  above  by 
an  insupportable  weight,  the  vault  will  burst  asunder,  the  crack  being 
small  in  the  upper  part  and  broad  below,  and  narrow  on  the  inner  side 
and  wide  on  the  outer  side,  after  the  manner  of  the  skin  of  a  pome- 
granate or  orange  which  splits  into  many  parts  lengthwise,  for  the 
more  it  is  pressed  upon  from  the  opposite  ends,  the  wider  asunder  will 
those  parts  of  the  joints  open  which  are  farthest  away  from  the  cause 
of  the  pressure.  And  for  this  reason  the  arches  of  the  vaults  of  any  apse 
should  never  be  loaded  more  than  the  arches  of  the  building  of  which 
it  forms  a  part,  especially  because  that  which  weighs  most  presses  most 
heavily  upon  the  parts  below  it  and  drives  them  down  upon  their 
foundations;  but  this  cannot  happen  with  lighter  things  such  as  the 
aforesaid  apses.  b.m.  141  v. 


1048  ARCHITECTURE 

Make  first  a  treatise  of  the  causes  which  bring  about  the  collapse  of 
walls,  and  then,  separately,  a  treatise  of  the  remedies. 

Parallel  cracks  are  constantly  appearing  in  buildings  erected  in  moun- 
tainous places  where  the  rocks  are  stratified  and  the  stratification  runs 
obliquely,  for,  in  these  oblique  seams,  water  and  other  moisture  often 
penetrates,  bearing  with  it  a  quantity  of  greasy  and  slimy  earth;  and 
since  this  stratification  does  not  continue  down  to  the  bottom  of  the 
valleys  the  rocks  go  slipping  down  their  slope,  and  never  end  their 
movement  until  they  have  descended  to  the  bottom  of  the  valley,  car- 
rying with  them  after  the  manner  of  a  boat  such  part  of  the  building 
as  they  have  severed  from  the  rest. 

The  remedy  for  this  is  to  build  numerous  piers  under  the  wall  which 
is  slipping  away,  with  arches  from  one  to  another,  and  well-rooted  [  P]1 
[  Pbuttressed]  and  let  the  pillars  have  their  bases  firmly  set  in  the  strati- 
fied rock  so  that  they  may  not  break  away. 

In  order  to  find  the  immovable  part  of  the  aforesaid  stratum,  it  is 
necessary  to  sink  a  shaft  through  it  to  a  great  depth  beneath  the  foot  of 
the  wall,  and  in  this  shaft  to  polish  a  smooth  surface  of  the  breadth  of 
a  hand  from  the  top  to  the  bottom  of  the  side  on  which  the  hill  slopes 
down.  At  the  end  of  some  time  this  smooth  portion  made  on  the  side  of 
the  shaft  will  show  very  plainly  which  part  of  the  mountain  is  moving. 

b.m.  157  r. 

OF  STONES  WHICH  BECOME  SEPARATED  FROM 
THEIR  MORTAR 

Stones  which  are  built  up  with  an  equal  number  from  bottom  to  top 
and  laid  with  an  equal  quantity  of  mortar,  will  settle  down  equally  as 
the  moisture  which  softens  the  mortar  evaporates. 

Cracks  in  walls  will  never  be  parallel  unless  the  part  of  the  wall 
which  is  separated  from  the  rest  does  not  descend. 

WHAT  LAW  IT  IS  WHICH  IMPARTS  STABILITY 
TO  BUILDINGS 

Stability  of  buildings  results  from  a  law  the  converse  of  the  two  fore- 
going, namely  that  the  walls  should  be  built  up  all  equally  in  equal 

1  MS.  abarbanati. 


ARCHITECTURE  1049 

stages,  which  should  embrace  the  whole  circuit  of  the  building  and  the 
total  thickness  of  the  walls  no  matter  of  what  kind;  and  although  the 
thin  wall  dries  more  rapidly  than  a  thick  one  it  will  not  have  to  break 
as  the  result  of  the  weight  which  it  may  acquire  from  one  day  to  an- 
other; for  if  a  double  quantity  of  it  were  to  dry  in  one  day,  a  wall  of 
double  the  thickness  would  dry  in  two  days  or  thereabouts,  and  so  a 
slight  difference  in  weight  would  be  balanced  by  a  slight  difference 
of  time. 

OF  THE  POSITION  OF  FOUNDATIONS  AND  IN  WHAT 
PLACES  THEY  ARE  A  CAUSE  OF  DESTRUCTION 

When  the  crack  in  a  wall  is  wider  at  the  top  than  at  the  bottom  it  is 
a  clear  sign  that  the  source  of  the  destruction  of  the  wall  lies  outside 
the  perpendicular  of  the  crack.  b.m.  157  v. 

OF  THE  CAUSE  OF  THE  COLLAPSE  OF  PUBLIC  AND 
PRIVATE  BUILDINGS 

Walls  collapse  as  a  result  of  cracks  which  are  either  vertical  or  slant- 
ing. Cracks  which  proceed  vertically  are  caused  by  new  walls  being 
built  in  conjunction  with  old  walls  either  vertically  or  with  toothings 
fitted  into  the  old  walls;  for  as  these  toothings  cannot  offer  any  resist- 
ance to  the  insupportable  weight  of  the  wall  joined  on  to  them  they 
must  needs  break  and  allow  the  new  wall  to  settle  down,  in  which 
process  it  will  sink  a  braccio  in  every  ten,  or  more  or  less  according  to 
the  greater  or  smaller  quantity  of  mortar  used  for  the  stones  in  the 
construction,  and  whether  the  mortar  is  very  liquid  or  not.  And  remem- 
ber always  to  build  the  walls  first  and  then  add  the  facing  stones, 
because  unless  this  is  done,  since  the  subsidence  of  the  wall  in  settling 
will  be  greater  than  that  of  the  outer  shell,  the  toothings  set  in  the  sides 
of  the  wall  will  necessarily  be  broken,  because  the  stones  used  for  facing 
the  walls  being  larger  than  the  stones  used  in  their  construction  will  of 
necessity  take  a  less  quantity  of  mortar  in  their  joints,  and  therefore  the 
subsidence  will  be  less.  But  this  cannot  happen  if  the  facing  of  the  wall 
is  added  after  the  wall  has  had  time  to  dry.  b.m.  158  r.

[  Water -st air  in  the  Sforzesea] 

When  the  descent  from  the  floodgates  has  been  so  hollowed  out  that 
at  the  end  of  its  drop  it  is  below  the  bed  of  the  river,  the  waters  which 
descend  from  them  will  never  form  a  cavity  at  the  foot  of  the  bank, 
and  will  not  carry  away  soil  in  their  rebound,  and  so  they  will  not 
proceed  to  form  a  fresh  obstacle  but  will  follow  the  transverse  course 
along  the  length  of  the  base  of  the  floodgate  from  the  under  side. 
Moreover  if  the  lowest  part  of  the  bank  which  lies  diagonally  across  the 
course  of  the  waters  be  constructed  in  deep  broad  steps  after  the  man- 
ner of  a  staircase,  the  waters  which  as  they  descend  in  their  course  are 
accustomed  to  fall  perpendicularly  from  the  beginning  of  this  lowest 
stage,  and  dig  out  the  foundations  of  the  bank,  will  not  be  able  any 
longer  to  descend  with  a  blow  of  irresistible  force.

A  certain  man  gave  up  associating  with  one  of  his  friends  because  the 
latter  had  a  habit  of  talking  maliciously  against  all  his  friends.  This 
friend  whom  he  had  left  was  once  reproaching  him,  and  after  many 
complaints  besought  him  to  tell  him  the  reason  that  had  caused  him  to 
lose  the  recollection  of  so  great  a  friendship  as  theirs;  to  which  he  made 
reply:  I  am  not  willing  to  be  seen  in  your  company  any  more  because 
I  like  you,  and  I  do  not  wish  that  by  talking  maliciously  to  others  of 
me  who  am  your  friend,  you  may  cause  them  to  form  a  bad  impression 
of  you,  as  I  have,  through  your  talking  maliciously  to  them  of  me  who 
am  your  friend.  Consequently  as  we  have  no  more  to  do  with  each 
other  it  will  appear  that  we  have  become  enemies,  and  the  fact  that  you 
talk  of  me  maliciously,  as  is  your  habit,  will  not  be  so  much  worthy  of 
rebuke  as  if  we  were  constantly  in  each  other's  company.

Dear  Benedetto, — To  give  you  the  news  of  the  things  here  from  the 
east,  you  must  know  that  in  the  month  of  June  there  appeared  a  giant 
who  came  from  the  Libyan  desert.  This  giant  was  born  on  Mount 
Atlas,  and  was  black,  and  he  fought  against  Artaxerxes  with  the  Egyp- 
tians and  Arabs,  the  Medes  and  Persians;  he  lived  in  the  sea  upon  the 
whales,  the  great  leviathans  and  the  ships.  When  the  savage  giant 
fell  by  reason  of  the  ground  being  covered  over  with  blood  and  mire, 
it  seemed  as  though  a  mountain  had  fallen;  whereat  the  country 
[shook]  as  though  there  were  an  earthquake,  with  terror  to  Pluto  in 
Hell,  and  Mars  fearing  for  his  life  fled  for  refuge  under  the  side  of 
Jove.1

And  from  the  violence  of  the  shock  he  lay  prostrate  on  the  level 
ground  as  though  stunned;  until  suddenly  the  people  believing  that  he 
had  been  killed  by  some  thunderbolt,  began  to  turn  about  his  great 
beard;  and  like  a  flock  of  ants  that  range  about  hither  and  thither 
furiously  among  the  brambles  beaten  down  by  the  axe  of  the  sturdy 
peasant,  so  these  are  hurrying  about  over  his  huge  limbs  and  piercing 
them  with  frequent  wounds. 

At  this  the  giant  being  roused  and,  perceiving  himself  to  be  almost 
covered  by  the  crowd,  suddenly  on  feeling  himself  smarting  from  their 
stabs,  uttered  a  roar  which  seemed  as  though  it  were  a  terrific  peal  of 
thunder,  and  set  his  hands  on  the  ground  and  lifted  up  his  awe- 
inspiring  countenance;  and  then  placing  one  of  his  hands  upon  his 
head,  he  perceived  it  to  be  covered  with  men  sticking  to  the  hairs  after 
the  fashion  of  tiny  creatures  which  are  sometimes  harboured  there, 
and  who,  as  they  clung  to  the  hairs  and  strove  to  hide  among  them, 
were  like  sailors  in  a  storm  who  mount  the  rigging  in  order  to  lower 
the  sail  and  lessen  the  force  of  the  wind;  and  at  this  point  he  shook 
his  head  and  sent  the  men  flying  through  the  air  after  the  manner  of 
hail  when  it  is  driven  by  the  fury  of  the  winds,  and  many  of  these 
men  were  found  to  be  killed  by  those  who  fell  on  them  like  a  tempest. 
Then  he  stood  erect,  trampling  upon  them  with  his  feet.

Note. — This  and  the  two  pieces  that  follow  seem  parts  of  a  fantastic  tale 
written  in  the  form  of  letters. 

The  black  visage  at  first  sight  is  most  horrible  and  terrifying  to  look 
upon,  especially  the  swollen  and  bloodshot  eyes  set  beneath  the  awful 
lowering  eyebrows  which  cause  the  sky  to  be  overcast  and  the  earth  to 
tremble. 

And  believe  me  there  is  no  man  so  brave  but  that,  when  the  fiery 
eyes  were  turned  upon  him,  he  would  willingly  have  put  on  wings  in 
order  to  escape,  for  the  face  of  infernal  Lucifer  would  seem  angelic  by 
contrast  with  this. 

The  nose  was  turned  up  in  a  snout  with  wide  nostrils  and  sticking 
out  of  these  were  quantities  of  large  bristles,  beneath  which  was  the 
arched  mouth,  with  the  thick  lips,  at  whose  extremities  were  hairs  like 


TALES  1055 

those  of  cats,  and  the  teeth  were  yellow;  and  from  the  top  of  his  in- 
step he  towered  above  the  heads  of  men  on  horseback. 

And  as  his  cramped  position  had  been  irksome,  and  in  order  to  rid 
himself  of  the  importunity  of  the  throng,  his  rage  turned  to  frenzy, 
and  he  began  to  let  his  feet  give  vent  to  the  frenzy  which  possessed  his 
mighty  limbs,  and  entering  in  among  the  crowd  he  began  by  his  kicks 
to  toss  men  up  in  the  air,  so  that  they  fell  down  again  upon  the  rest, 
as  though  there  had  been  a  thick  storm  of  hail,  and  many  were  those 
who  in  dying  dealt  out  death.  And  this  barbarity  continued  until  such 
time  as  the  dust  stirred  up  by  his  great  feet,  rising  up  in  the  air,  com- 
pelled his  infernal  fury  to  abate,  while  we  continued  our  flight. 

Alas,  how  many  attacks  were  made  upon  this  raging  fiend  to  whom 
every  onslaught  was  as  nothing.  O  wretched  folk,  for  you  there  avail 
not  the  impregnable  fortresses,  nor  the  lofty  walls  of  your  cities,  nor 
the  being  together  in  great  numbers,  nor  your  houses  or  palaces!  There 
remained  not  any  place  unless  it  were  the  tiny  holes  and  subterranean 
caverns  where  after  the  manner  of  crabs  and  crickets  and  creatures  like 
these  you  might  find  safety  and  a  means  of  escape.  Oh,  how  many 
wretched  mothers  and  fathers  were  deprived  of  their  children!  How 
many  unhappy  women  were  deprived  of  their  companions!  In  truth, 
my  dear  Benedetto,  I  do  not  believe  that  ever  since  the  world  was 
created  there  has  been  witnessed  such  lamentation  and  wailing  of 
people,  accompaned  by  so  great  terror.  In  truth,  the  human  species  in 
such  a  plight  has  need  to  envy  every  other  race  of  creatures;  for  though 
the  eagle  has  strength  sufficient  to  subdue  the  other  birds,  they  yet 
remain  unconquered  through  the  rapidity  of  their  flight,  and  so  the 
swallows  through  their  speed  escape  becoming  the  prey  of  the  falcon, 
and  the  dolphins  also  by  their  swift  flight  escape  becoming  the  prey  of 
the  whales  and  of  the  mighty  leviathans;  but  for  us  wretched  mortals 
there  avails  not  any  flight,  since  this  monster  when  advancing  slowly 
far  exceeds  the  speed  of  the  swiftest  courser. 

I  know  not  what  to  say  or  do,  for  everywhere  I  seem  to  find  myself 
swimming  with  bent  head  within  the  mighty  throat  and  remaining 
indistinguishable  in  death,  buried  within  the  huge  belly.

the  lord  what  his  purpose  was  in  coming;  he  replied  that  he  went  there 
to  have  one  of  the  pleasures  that  he  could  not  have,  for  it  gave  him 
pleasure  to  look  at  people  who  were  grander  than  himself,  as  is  the 
way  with  common  folk,  whereas  the  lord  could  only  look  at  people 
who  were  of  less  account  than  himself,  and  consequently  lords  were 
cut  off  from  this  pleasure.  Forster  in  34  v.

A  JEST 

A  priest  while  going  the  round  of  his  parish  on  the  Saturday  before 
Easter  in  order  to  sprinkle  the  houses  with  holy  water  as  was  his  cus- 
tom, coming  to  the  studio  of  a  painter,  and  there  beginning  to  sprinkle 
the  water  upon  some  of  his  pictures,  the  painter  turning  round  with 
some  annoyance  asked  him  why  he  sprinkled  his  pictures  in  this  man- 
ner. The  priest  replied  that  it  was  the  custom  and  that  it  was  his  duty 
to  act  thus,  that  he  was  doing  a  good  deed  and  that  whoever  did  a 
good  deed  might  expect  a  recompense  as  great  or  even  greater;  for  so 
God  had  promised  that  for  every  good  deed  which  we  do  on  the 
earth  we  shall  be  rewarded  a  hundredfold  from  on  high.  Then  the 
painter,  having  waited  until  the  priest  had  made  his  exit,  stepped  to 
the  window  above  and  threw  a  large  bucket  of  water  down  on  to  his 
back,  calling  out  to  him: — 'See  there  is  the  reward  that  comes  to  you 
a  hundredfold  from  on  high  as  you  said  it  would,  on  account  of  the 
good  deed  you  did  me  with  your  holy  water  with  which  you  have 
half  ruined  my  pictures'.  c.a.  119  r.  a 

The  Franciscan  friars  at  certain  seasons  have  periods  of  fasting,  dur-

journey,  as  they  are  then  living  on  almsgiving,  they  are  allowed  to  eat 
whatever  is  set  before  them.  Now  a  couple  of  these  friars  travelling 
under  these  conditions  chanced  to  alight  at  an  inn  at  the  same  time  as

a  certain  merchant  and  sat  down  at  the  same  table,  and  on  account  of 
the  poverty  of  the  inn  nothing  was  served  there  except  one  roasted 
cockerel.  At  this  the  merchant  as  he  saw  that  it  would  be  scant  fare 
for  himself  turned  to  the  friars  and  said: — 'On  days  like  these  if  I 
remember  rightly  you  are  not  permitted  in  your  monasteries  to  eat 
any  kind  of  meat.'  The  friars  on  hearing  these  words  were  constrained 
by  their  rule  to  admit  without  any  attempt  at  argument  that  this  was 
indeed  the  case:  so  the  merchant  had  his  desire  and  devoured  the 
chicken,  and  the  friars  fared  as  best  they  could. 

Now  after  having  dined  in  this  wise  all  three  table-companions  set 
out  on  their  journey  together,  and  having  gone  a  certain  distance  they 
came  to  a  river  of  considerable  breadth  and  depth,  and  as  they  were 
all  three  on  foot,  the  friars  by  reason  of  their  poverty  and  the  other 
from  niggardliness,  it  was  necessary  according  to  the  custom  of  the 
country  that  one  of  the  friars  who  had  no  shoes  and  stockings  should 
carry  the  merchant  on  his  shoulders;  and  consequently  the  friar  hav- 
ing given  him  his  clogs  to  hold  took  the  man  on  his  back.  But  as  it 
so  happened  the  friar  when  he  found  himself  in  the  middle  of  the 
stream  bethought  himself  of  another  of  his  rules,  and  coming  to  a 
standstill  after  the  manner  of  St.  Christopher  raised  his  head  towards 
him  who  was  weighing  heavily  upon  him  and  said: — 'Just  te^  me> 
have  you  any  money  about  you?'  'Why  you  know  quite  well  that  I 
have/  replied  the  other.  'How  do  you  suppose  a  merchant  like  me 
could  travel  about  otherwise?'  'Alas!'  said  the  friar,  'our  rule  forbids 
us  to  carry  any  money  on  our  backs';  and  he  instantly  threw  him  into 
the  water. 

As  the  merchant  was  conscious  that  this  was  done  as  a  jest  and  out 
of  revenge  for  the  injury  he  had  done  them  he  smiled  pleasantly  and 
pacifically,  and  blushing  considerably  from  shame  he  endured  their 
revenge.  c.a.  150  v.  b

On  an  old  man  openly  reviling  a  young  one  and  boldly  proclaiming

A  man  wishing  to  prove  on  the  authority  of  Pythagoras  that  he  had 
been  in  the  world  on  a  former  occasion,  and  another  not  allowing  him 
to  conclude  his  argument,  the  first  man  said  to  the  second: — 'And  this 
is  a  token  that  I  was  here  on  a  former  occasion,  I  remember  that  you 
were  a  miller.'  The  other  who  felt  provoked  by  his  words  agreed  that 
it  was  true,  for  he  also  remembered  as  a  token  that  the  speaker  had 
been  the  ass  which  had  carried  the  flour  for  him. 

A  painter  was  asked  why  he  had  made  his  children  so  ugly,  when

who  called  herself  Madame  Bona. 

Whereat  the  sick  man  raised  his  arms  to  heaven  and  praised  God 
with  a  loud  voice,  and  then  told  the  servants  to  let  her  in  immediately

'The  mirror  bears  itself  proudly,  holding  the  queen 

mirrored  within  it,  and  after  she  has  departed  the 

mirror  remains  abject.' 

The  privet  on  feeling  its  tender  branches,  laden  with  new  fruit,  pricked 
by  the  sharp  claws  and  beak  of  the  troublesome  blackbird,  complained 
to  her  with  pitiful  reproaches,  beseeching  her  that  even  if  she  plucked 
off  her  delicious  fruit  she  would  at  any  rate  not  deprive  her  of  her 
leaves  which  protected  her  from  the  scorching  rays  of  the  sun,  nor 
with  her  sharp  claws  rend  away  and  strip  bare  her  tender  bark. 

But  to  this  the  blackbird  replied  with  insolent  rebuke: — 'Silence! 
rude  bramble!  Know  you  not  that  Nature  has  made  you  to  produce 
these  fruits  for  my  sustenance  ?  Cannot  you  see  that  you  came  into  the 
world  in  order  to  supply  me  with  this  very  food?  Know  you  not,  vile 
thing  that  you  are,  that  next  winter  you  will  serve  as  sustenance  and 
food  for  the  fire?'  To  which  words  the  tree  listened  patiently  and  not 
without  tears. 

But  a  short  time  afterwards  the  blackbird  was  caught  in  a  net,  and 
some  boughs  were  cut  to  make  a  cage  in  order  to  imprison  her,  and 
among  the  rest  were  some  cut  from  the  tender  privet  to  serve  for  the 
rods  of  the  cage;  and  these  on  perceiving  that  they  would  be  the  cause 
of  the  blackbird  being  deprived  of  liberty  rejoiced  and  uttered  these 
words: — 'We  are  here,  O  blackbird,  not  yet  consumed  by  the  fire  as 
you  said;  we  shall  see  you  in  prison  before  you  see  us  burnt.' 

The  laurel  and  the  myrtle,  on  seeing  the  pear-tree  being  cut  down, 
cried  out  with  a  loud  voice: — 'O  pear-tree,  where  are  you  going? 
Where  is  the  pride  that  you  had  when  you  were  laden  with  ripe  fruit  ? 
Now  you  will  no  longer  make  shade  for  us  with  your  thick  foliage.' 
Then  the  pear-tree  replied: — 'I  am  going  with  the  husbandman  who 
is  cutting  me  down  and  who  will  take  me  to  the  workshop  of  a  good

The  chestnut  seeing  a  man  upon  the  fig-tree  bending  its  branches 
clown  towards  himself  and  picking  ofT  their  ripe  fruit  and  putting  it  in 
his  mouth,  tearing  it  asunder  and  crushing  it  with  his  hard  teeth,  shook 
its  boughs  and  said  in  a  mournful  whisper: — 'O  fig-tree,  how  much 
less  favoured  by  Nature  are  you  than  I.  Look  how  with  me  my  sweet 
children  all  are  arranged  in  close  order,  clothed  first  with  a  fine  jacket 
over  which  is  set  the  hard  rough  husk;  and  not  content  with  confer- 
ring such  benefits  on  me  she  has  given  them  a  strong  dwelling,  and  set 
about  it  sharp  close  prickles  so  that  the  hands  of  man  may  not  be  able 
to  harm  me.'  At  this  the  fig-tree  and  her  children  began  to  laugh,  and 
when  they  had  finished  laughing  she  said : — 'Know  that  man  is  of  such 
a  disposition  that,  as  you  have  found,  by  means  of  rods  and  stones 
and  sticks  thrown  into  your  branches  he  will  deprive  you  of  your 
fruit,  and  after  it  has  fallen  will  crush  it  with  his  feet  or  with  stones, 
in  such  a  way  that  your  offspring  will  issue  forth  from  their  armoured 
house  crushed  and  bruised.  But  I  am  touched  carefully  by  his  hands 
and  not  as  you  are  with  sticks  and  stones.' 

The  idle  fluttering  moth,  not  contented  with  its  power  to  fly  wher- 
ever it  pleased  through  the  air,  enthralled  by  the  seductive  flame  of 
the  candle,  resolved  to  fly  into  it,  and  its  joyous  movement  was  the 
occasion  of  instant  mourning.  For  in  the  said  flame  its  delicate  wings 
were  consumed,  and  the  wretched  moth  having  fallen  down  at  the 
foot  of  the  candlestick,  all  burnt,  after  much  weeping  and  contrition, 
wiped  the  tears  from  its  streaming  eyes,  and  lifting  up  its  face  ex- 
claimed:— 'O  false  light,  how  many  are  there  like  me  who  have  been 
miserably  deceived  by  you  in  times  past!  Alas!  If  my  one  desire  was 
to  behold  the  light,  ought  I  not  to  have  distinguished  the  sun  from 
the  false  glimmer  of  filthy  tallow?' 

A  nut  which  found  itself  carried  by  a  crow  to  the  top  of  a  lofty

it  in  causing  it  to  be  so  exalted  and  great,  and  so  rich  in  having  bells 
of  such  beauty  and  of  such  mellow  tone,  that  it  would  deign  to  give 
it  succour;  that  insomuch  as  it  had  not  been  able  to  drop  beneath  its 
old  father's  green  branches  and  lie  in  the  fallow  earth  covered  by  his 
fallen  leaves  the  wall  would  not  abandon  it,  for  when  it  found  itself 
in  the  fierce  crow's  cruel  beak  it  had  vowed  that  if  it  escaped  thence 
it  would  end  its  days  in  a  small  hole.  At  these  words  the  wall,  moved 
with  compassion,  was  content  to  give  it  shelter  in  the  spot  where  it 
had  fallen.  And  within  a  short  space  of  time  the  nut  began  to  burst 
open  and  to  put  its  roots  in  among  the  crevices  of  the  stones,  and  push 
them  farther  apart  and  throw  up  shoots  out  of  its  hollow,  and  these 
soon  rose  above  the  top  of  the  building;  and  as  the  twisted  roots  grew 
thicker  they  commenced  to  tear  asunder  the  walls  and  force  the  ancient 
stones  out  of  their  old  positions.  Then  the  wall  too  late  and  in  vain 
deplored  the  cause  of  its  destruction,  and  in  a  short  time  it  was 
torn  asunder  and  a  great  part  fell  in  ruin. 

The  ape  on  finding  a  nest  of  small  birds  approached  them  with  great

having  commenced  to  look  at  the  tiny  bird  he  began  to  kiss  it;  and  in 
his  uncontrollable  affection  he  gave  it  so  many  kisses  and  turned  it  over 
and  squeezed  it,  until  he  took  away  its  life.  This  is  said  for  those  who

The  unhappy  willow,  on  finding  herself  unable  to  enjoy  the  pleas- 
ure of  seeing  her  slender  boughs  attain  to  such  a  height  as  she  desired, 
or  even  point  towards  the  sky,  because  she  was  continually  being 
maimed  and  lopped  and  spoiled  for  the  sake  of  the  vine  or  any  other 
tree  which  happened  to  be  near,  summoned  up  all  her  faculties  and  by 
this  means  opened  wide  the  portals  of  her  imagination,  remaining  in 
continual  meditation,  and  seeking  in  the  world  of  plants  for  one  where- 
with to  ally  herself  which  could  not  need  the  help  of  her  branches.  So 
continuing  for  a  time  with  her  imagination  at  work,  the  thought  of  the 
gourd  suddenly  presented  itself  to  her  mind,  and  all  her  branches 
quivered  in  her  intense  joy,  for  it  seemed  to  her  that  she  had  found  the

FABLES  1063 

right  companion  for  the  purpose  she  desired,  because  the  gourd  is  by 
nature  more  fitted  to  bind  others  than  to  be  bound  herself.  After  com- 
ing to  this  conclusion  she  lifted  up  her  branches  towards  the  sky  and 
waited,  on  the  look  out  for  some  friendly  bird  to  serve  as  the  interme- 
diary of  her  desire.  Among  the  rest  she  descried  the  magpie  near  to 
her  and  said  to  him: — 'O  gentle  bird,  by  the  refuge  you  have  lately 
found  among  my  branches  at  dawn,  when  the  hungry,  cruel,  and 
rapacious  falcon  has  wished  to  devour  you, — by  that  rest  you  have  often 
found  in  me  when  your  wings  craved  rest, — by  those  delights  you  have 
enjoyed  among  my  branches  in  amorous  dalliance  with  your  compan- 
ions,— I  entreat  you  to  go  and  seek  out  the  gourd  and  obtain  from  her 
some  of  her  seeds,  telling  her  that  I  will  care  for  whatever  is  born  from 
them  as  though  they  were  my  own  offspring,  and  in  like  manner  use 
all  such  words  as  may  incline  her  to  the  like  purpose,  though  to  you 
who  are  a  master  of  language  there  is  no  need  for  me  to  give  instruc- 
tion. If  you  will  do  this  I  am  content  to  let  your  nest  be  in  the  fork  of 
my  boughs  together  with  all  your  family  without  payment  of  any  rent.' 
So  the  magpie,  after  stipulating  with  the  willow  for  certain  further 
conditions,  the  most  important  being  that  she  should  never  admit  upon 
her  boughs  any  snake  or  polecat,  cocked  his  tail  and  lowered  his  head, 
and  casting  himself  loose  from  the  bough  let  himself  float  on  his 
wings;  and  beating  about  with  these  in  the  fleeting  air,  seeking  hither 
and  thither,  and  guiding  himself  by  using  his  tail  as  a  rudder,  he 
came  to  a  gourd,  and  after  courteously  saluting  her  obtained  by  a  few 
polite  word  the  seeds  for  which  he  sought.  On  taking  these  back  to 
the  willow  he  was  welcomed  with  joyful  looks;  and  then  scraping 
away  with  his  foot  some  of  the  earth  near  the  willow  he  planted  the 
grains  with  his  beak  round  about  her  in  a  circle. 

These  soon  began  to  grow,  and  as  the  branches  increased  and  opened 
out  they  began  to  cover  all  the  branches  of  the  willow,  and  their  great 
leaves  shut  away  from  it  the  beauty  of  the  sun  and  the  sky.  And  all 
this  evil  not  sufficing,  the  gourds  next  began  to  drag  down  to  the 
ground  in  their  rude  grip  the  tops  of  the  slender  boughs,  twisting  them 
and  distorting  them  in  strange  shapes.  Then  the  willow  after  shaking 
and  tossing  herself  to  no  purpose  to  make  the  gourds  loose  their  hold, 
and  vainly  for  days  cherishing  such  idle  hopes,  since  the  grasp  of  the 
gourds  was  so  sure  and  firm  as  to  forbid  such  thoughts,  seeing  the

wind  pass  by,  forthwith  commended  herself  to  it.  And  the  wind  blew 
hard;  and  it  rent  open  the  willow's  old  and  hollow  trunk,  tearing  it  in 
two  parts  right  down  to  its  roots;  and  as  they  fell  asunder  she  vainly 
bewailed  her  fate,  confessing  herself  born  to  no  good  end. 

Some  flames  had  already  lived  for  a  month  in  a  glass-furnace  when 
they  saw  a  candle  approaching  in  a  beautiful  and  glittering  candlestick. 
They  strove  with  great  longing  to  reach  it;  and  one  of  their  number 
left  its  natural  course  and  wound  itself  into  an  unburnt  brand  upon 
which  it  fed,  and  then  passed  out  at  the  other  end  by  a  small  cleft  to 
the  candle  which  was  near,  and  flung  itself  upon  it,  and  devouring  it 
with  the  utmost  voracity  and  greed  consumed  it  almost  entirely;  then 
desirous  of  prolonging  its  own  life,  it  strove  in  vain  to  return  to  the 
furnace  which  it  had  left,  but  was  forced  to  droop  and  die  together 
with  the  candle.  So  at  last  in  lamentation  and  regret  it  was  changed  to 
foul  smoke,  leaving  all  its  sisters  in  glowing  and  abiding  life  and 
beauty. 

Wine,  the  divine  liquor  of  the  grape,  finding  itself  in  a  golden  richly 
chased  cup  upon  Mahomet's  table,  after  being  transported  with  pride  at 
such  an  honour,  was  suddenly  assailed  by  a  contrary  feeling,  and  said 
to  itself: — 'What  am  I  doing?  What  is  it  that  I  am  rejoicing  at?  Can- 
not I  see  that  I  am  near  to  my  death,  in  that  I  am  about  to  leave  my 
golden  dwelling  in  this  cup  and  enter  into  the  foul  and  fetid  caverns 
of  the  human  body,  to  be  there  transformed  from  a  sweet  fragrant 
nectar  to  a  foul  and  disgusting  fluid?  And  such  an  evil  not  sufficing, 
I  must  needs  lie  for  a  long  time  in  foul  receptacles  with  other  noisome 
and  putrid  matter  evacuated  from  the  human  intestines.'  It  cried  to 
heaven  demanding  vengeance  for  such  injury  and  that  an  end  might 
be  put  to  such  an  insult,  so  that  since  that  part  of  the  country  pro- 
duced the  most  beautiful  and  finest  grapes  in  the  whole  world  these  at 
least  should  not  be  turned  into  wine.  Then  Jove  caused  the  wine 
which  Mahomet  drank  to  rise  in  spirit  up  to  the  brain,  and  to  infect 
this  to  such  a  degree  as  to  make  him  mad;  and  he  committed  so  many 
follies  that  when  he  came  to  his  senses  he  made  a  decree  that  no  Asiatic 
should  drink  wine;  and  thus  the  vine  and  its  fruits  were  left  at  liberty.

he  perpetrates  irreparable  crimes,  killing  his  own  friends.

The  rat  was  being  besieged  in  its  tiny  house  by  the  weasel  which 
with  unceasing  vigilance  was  awaiting  its  destruction,  and  through  a 
tiny  chink  it  was  considering  its  great  danger.  Meanwhile  the  cat  came 
and  suddenly  seized  hold  of  the  weasel  and  immediately  devoured  it. 
Thereupon  the  rat,  profoundly  grateful  to  its  deity,  having  offered  up 
some  of  its  hazel-nuts  as  a  sacrifice  to  Jove,  issued  forth  from  its  hole 
in  order  to  repossess  itself  of  the  liberty  it  had  lost,  and  was  instantly 
deprived  of  this  and  of  life  itself  by  the  cruel  claws  and  teeth  of  the  cat.

Fable  of  the  tongue  bitten  by  the  teeth. 

The  cedar,  arrogant  by  reason  of  its  beauty,  despising  the  plants 
which  were  round  about  it,  caused  them  to  be  all  removed  from  its 
presence,  and  then  the  wind,  not  meeting  with  any  obstacle,  tore  it  up 
by  the  roots  and  threw  it  on  to  the  ground. 

The  ant  having  found  a  grain  of  millet,  the  grain  as  it  felt  itself 
seized  by  it  cried  out: — 'If  you  will  do  me  the  great  favour  of  allowing 
me  to  fulfil  my  desire  to  germinate  I  will  give  you  of  myself  a  hundred- 
fold.' And  so  it  was. 

The  spider,  having  found  a  bunch  of  grapes,  which  because  of  its 
sweetness  was  much  visited  by  bees  and  various  sorts  of  flies,  fancied 
that  it  had  found  a  spot  very  suitable  for  its  wiles.  And  after  having 
lowered  itself  down  by  its  fine  thread  and  entered  its  new  habitation, 
there  day  by  day,  having  ensconced  itself  in  the  tiny  holes  made  by 
the  spaces  between  the  various  grapes  in  the  bunch,  like  a  robber  it 
assaulted  the  wretched  animals  which  were  not  on  their  guard  against 
it.  But  after  some  days  had  passed  the  keeper  of  the  vineyard  cut  this 
bunch  of?  and  placed  it  with  the  others,  and  it  was  pressed  with  them. 
And  the  grapes  therefore  served  as  trap  and  snare  for  the  deceiving 
spider  as  well  as  for  the  flies  whom  he  had  deceived.

The  traveller's  joy,  not  remaining  contented  in  its  hedge,  com-

The  ass  having  fallen  asleep  upon  the  ice  of  a  deep  lake,  the  heat  of

his  great  discomfort,  and  was  speedily  drowned. 

A  certain  patch  of  snow,  finding  itself  clinging  to  the  top  of  a  rock 
which  was  perched  on  the  extreme  summit  of  a  very  high  mountain, 
being  left  to  its  own  imagination  began  to  reflect  and  to  say  within 
itself: — 'Shall  I  not  be  thought  haughty  and  proud  for  having  placed 
myself  in  so  exalted  a  spot,  being  indeed  a  mere  morsel  of  snow  ?  And 
for  allowing  that  such  a  vast  quantity  of  snow  as  I  see  around  me 
should  take  a  lower  place  than  mine?  Truly  my  small  dimensions  do 
not  deserve  this  eminence;  and  in  proof  of  my  insignificance  I  may 
readily  acquaint  myself  with  the  fate  which  but  yesterday  befell  my 
companions,  who  in  a  few  hours  were  destroyed  by  the  sun;  and  this 
came  about  from  their  having  placed  themselves  in  a  loftier  station 
than  was  required  of  them.  I  will  flee  from  the  wrath  of  the  sun,  and 
abase  myself,  and  find  a  place  that  befits  my  modest  size.' 

Then  throwing  itself  down,  it  began  to  descend,  rolling  down  from 
the  lofty  crags  on  to  the  other  snow;  and  the  more  it  sought  a  lowly 
place,  the  more  it  increased  in  bulk,  until  at  last  ending  its  course  upon 
a  hill,  it  found  itself  almost  the  equal  in  size  of  the  hill  on  which  it 
rested,  and  it  was  the  last  of  the  snow  which  was  melted  that  summer 
by  the  sun. 

This  is  said  for  those  who  by  humbling  themselves  are  exalted. 

The  hawk,  being  unable  to  endure  with  patience  the  way  in  which

THE  CEDAR 

The  cedar,  having  conceived  the  desire  of  bearing  on  its  summit  a 
large  and  beautiful  fruit,  set  itself  to  carry  it  into  effect  with  all  the 
powers  of  its  sap;  which  fruit  after  it  had  grown  was  the  cause  of 
making  the  tall  and  slender  summit  bend  down. 

THE  PEACH-TREE 

The  peach-tree,  being  envious  of  the  great  quantity  of  fruit  that  it 
saw  its  neighbour  the  nut-tree  bearing,  decided  to  do  the  same,  and 
loaded  itself  with  its  fruit  to  such  an  extent  that  the  weight  of  this 
fruit  threw  it  down,  uprooted  and  broken,  level  with  the  ground. 

THE  NUT-TREE 

The  nut-tree,  displaying  to  the  passers-by  upon  the  road  the  richness 
of  its  fruit,  every  man  stoned  it. 

When  the  fig-tree  stood  without  fruit  no  one  looked  at  it.  Wishing 
by  producing  this  fruit  to  be  praised  by  men,  it  was  bent  and  broken 
by  them. 

The  fig-tree,  standing  near  to  the  elm,  and  perceiving  that  her  boughs 
bore  no  fruit  themselves,  yet  had  the  hardihood  to  keep  away  the  sun 
from  her  own,  unripe  figs,  rebuked  her,  saying: — 'O  Elm,  are  you  not 
ashamed  to  stand  in  front  of  me?  Only  wait  until  my  children  are 
fully  grown  and  you  will  see  where  you  will  find  yourself.'  But  when 
her  offspring  were  ripe  a  regiment  of  soldiers  came  to  the  place,  and 
they  tore  off  the  branches  of  the  fig-tree  in  order  to  take  her  figs,  and 
left  her  all  stripped  and  broken. 

And  as  she  thus  stood  maimed  in  all  her  limbs  the  elm  questioned 
her  saying: — 'O  Fig  tree,  how  much  better  was  it  to  be  without  chil- 
dren than  to  be  brought  by  them  to  so  wretched  a  pass?'  c.a.  76  r.  a 

The  fire  rejoicing  in  the  dried  wood  which  it  had  found  in  the  fire-

size,  commenced  to  exalt  its  gentle  and  tranquil  soul  in  puffed-up  and 
insupportable  pride,  making  itself  almost  believe  that  it  had  drawn  the 
whole  of  the  superior  element  down  into  the  few  logs.  And  com- 
mencing to  fume  and  fill  all  the  fireplace  round  about  it  with  explo- 
sions and  showers  of  sparks,  already  the  flames  which  had  become 
big  were  all  in  conjunction  making  their  way  towards  the  air;  then 
the  highest  flames  striking  upon  the  bottom  of  the  saucepan  above  .  .  . 

A  vestige  of  fire  which  had  remained  in  a  small  lump  of  charcoal 
among  the  warm  embers,  was  very  scantily  and  poorly  nourished  by 
the  small  quantity  of  nutriment  that  was  left  there.  When  the  superin- 
tendent of  the  kitchen  arrived  there  in  order  to  perform  her  usual  work 
of  preparing  the  food,  having  placed  the  logs  on  the  hearth,  and  having 
succeeded  by  means  of  a  sulphur-match  in  getting  a  small  flame  from 
the  charcoal  though  it  was  almost  extinct,  she  set  it  among  the  logs 
which  she  had  arranged  and  took  a  saucepan  and  set  it  over  it  and 
without  any  misgivings  went  away  from  it. 

Then  the  fire,  after  rejoicing  at  the  dried  logs  placed  upon  it,  began 
to  ascend  and  drive  out  the  air  from  the  spaces  between  the  logs,  twin- 
ing itself  in  among  them  in  sportive  and  joyous  progress,  and  having 
commenced  to  blow  through  the  spaces  between  the  logs  out  of  which 
it  had  made  delightful  windows  for  itself,  and  to  emit  gleaming  and 
shining  flames,  it  suddenly  dispels  the  murky  darkness  of  the  closed-in 
kitchen,  and  the  flames  having  already  increased  began  to  play  joy- 
fully with  the  air  that  surrounded  them,  and  singing  with  gentle  mur- 
mur they  created  a  sweet  sound.  c.a.  116  v.  b 

The  thrushes  rejoiced  greatly  on  seeing  a  man  catch  the  owl  and 
take  away  her  liberty  by  binding  her  feet  with  strong  bonds.  But  then 
by  means  of.  bird-lime  the  owl  was  the  cause  of  the  thrushes  losing  not 
only  their  liberty  but  even  their  life.  This  is  said  of  those  states  which 
rejoice  at  seeing  their  rulers  lose  their  liberty,  in  consequence  of  which 
they  afterwards  lose  hope  of  succour  and  remain  bound  in  the  power 
of  their  enemy,  losing  their  liberty  and  often  life.  c.a.  117  r.  b 

While  the  dog  was  asleep  on  the  coat  of  a  sheep,  one  of  its  fleas,  be-

and  nails  of  the  dog  than  getting  his  food  on  the  dog  as  he  did.  With- 
out more  reflection  therefore  it  left  the  dog  and  entering  into  the  thick 
wool  began  with  great  toil  to  try  to  pass  to  the  roots  of  the  hairs;  which 
enterprise  however  after  much  sweat  it  found  to  be  impossible,  owing 
to  these  hairs  being  so  thick  as  almost  to  touch  each  other,  and  there 
being  no  space  there  where  the  flea  could  taste  the  skin.  Consequently 
after  long  labour  and  fatigue  it  began  to  wish  to  go  back  to  its  dog 
which  however  had  already  departed,  so  that  after  long  repentance  and 
bitter  tears  it  was  obliged  to  die  of  hunger.  c.a.  119  r.  a 

Once  upon  a  time  the  razor  emerging  from  the  handle  which  served 
it  as  a  sheath,  and  placing  itself  in  the  sun,  saw  the  sun  reflected  on  its 
surface,  at  which  thing  it  took  great  pride,  and  turning  it  over  in  its 
thoughts  it  began  to  say  to  itself: — 'Am  I  to  go  back  any  more  to  that 
shop  from  which  I  have  just  now  come  away?  No  surely!  It  cannot 
be  the  pleasure  of  the  gods  that  such  radiant  beauty  should  stoop  to 
such  vile  uses!  What  madness  would  that  be  which  should  induce  me 
to  scrape  the  lathered  chins  of  rustic  peasants  and  to  do  such  menial 
service?  Is  this  body  made  for  actions  such  as  these?  Certainly  not!  I 
will  go  and  hide  myself  in  some  retired  spot,  and  there  pass  my  life  in 
tranquil  ease.' 

And  so  having  hidden  itself  away  for  some  months,  returning  one 
day  to  the  light  and  coming  out  of  its  sheath  it  perceived  that  it  had 
acquired  the  appearance  of  a  rusty  saw,  and  that  its  surface  no  longer 
reflected  the  sun's  radiance.  In  vain  with  useless  repentance  it  be- 
moaned its  irreparable  hurt,  saying  to  itself: — 'Ah  how  much  better 
would  it  have  been  to  have  let  the  barber  use  that  lost  edge  of  mine 
that  had  so  rare  a  keenness!  Where  now  is  the  glittering  surface?  In 
truth  the  foul  insidious  rust  has  consumed  it  away!' 

The  same  thing  happens  with  minds  which  in  lieu  of  exercise  give 
themselves  up  to  sloth;  for  these  like  the  razor  lose  their  keen  edge, 
and  the  rust  of  ignorance  destroys  their  form. 

A  stone  of  considerable  size,  only  recently  left  uncovered  by  the 
waters,  stood  in  a  certain  spot  perched  up  at  the  edge  of  a  delightful 
copse,  above  a  stony  road,  surrounded  by  plants  bright  with  various 
flowers  of  different  colours,  and  looked  upon  the  great  mass  of  stones 
which  lay  heaped  together  in  the  road  beneath.  And  she  became  filled 


1070  FABLES 

with  longing  to  let  herself  down  there,  saying  within  herself: — 'What 
am  I  doing  here  with  these  plants  ?  I  would  fain  dwell  in  the  company 
of  my  sisters  yonder';  and  so  letting  herself  fall  she  ended  her  rapid 
course  among  her  desired  companions.  But  when  she  had  been  there 
for  a  short  time  she  found  herself  in  continual  distress  from  the  wheels 
of  the  carts,  the  iron  hoofs  of  the  horses  and  the  feet  of  the  passers-by. 
One  rolled  her  over,  another  trampled  upon  her;  and  at  times  she 
raised  herself  up  a  little  as  she  lay  covered  with  mud  or  the  dung  of 
some  animal,  and  vainly  looked  up  at  the  place  from  whence  she  had 
departed  as  a  place  of  solitude  and  quiet  peace. 

So  it  happens  to  those  who,  leaving  a  life  of  solitude  and  contempla- 
tion, choose  to  come  and  dwell  in  cities  among  people  full  of  infinite 
wickedness.  c.a.  175  v.  a 

As  the  painted  butterfly  was  idly  wandering  and  flitting  about 
through  the  darkened  air  a  light  came  within  sight,  and  thither  im- 
mediately it  directed  its  course,  and  flew  round  about  it  in  varying 
circles  marvelling  greatly  at  such  radiant  beauty.  And  not  contented 
merely  to  behold,  it  began  to  treat  it  as  was  its  custom  with  the  fragrant 
flowers,  and  directing  its  flight  it  approached  with  bold  resolve  close 
to  the  light,  which  thereupon  consumed  the  tips  of  its  wings  and  legs 
and  the  other  extremities;  and  then  dropping  down  at  the  foot  of  it, 
it  began  to  consider  with  astonishment  how  this  accident  had  been 
brought  about;  for  it  could  not  so  much  as  entertain  a  thought  that 
any  evil  or  hurt  could  possibly  come  to  it  from  a  thing  so  beautiful; 
and  then  having  in  part  regained  the  strength  which  it  had  lost,  it 
took  another  flight  and  passed  right  through  the  body  of  the  flame, 
and  in  an  instant  fell  down  burned  into  the  oil  which  fed  the  flame, 
preserving  only  so  much  life  as  sufficed  it  to  reflect  upon  the  cause  of 
its  destruction,  saying  to  it: — 'O  accursed  light!  I  thought  that  in  you 
I  had  found  my  happiness!  Vainly  do  I  lament  my  mad  desire,  and 
by  my  ruin  I  have  come  to  know  your  rapacious  and  destructive 
nature.' 

To  which  the  light  replied: — 'Thus  do  I  treat  whoever  does  not 
know  how  to  use  me  aright.' 

This  is  said  for  those  who  when  they  see  before  them  these  carnal 
and  worldly  delights,  hasten  towards  them  like  the  butterfly,  without

The  flint  on  being  struck  by  the  steel  marvelled  greatly  and  said  to 
it  in  a  stern  voice: — 'What  arrogance  prompts  you  to  annoy  me? 
Trouble  me  not,  for  you  have  chosen  me  by  mistake;  I  have  never 
done  harm  to  anyone.'  To  which  the  steel  made  answer: — 'If  you  will 
be  patient  you  will  see  what  a  marvellous  result  will  issue  forth  from 
you.' 

At  these  words  the  flint  was  pacified  and  patiently  endured  its  mar- 
tyrdom, and  it  saw  itself  give  birth  to  the  marvellous  element  of  fire 
which  by  its  potency  became  a  factor  in  innumerable  things. 

This  is  said  for  those  who  are  dismayed  at  the  outset  of  their  studies,

itself;  and  after  it  had  risen  to  a  great  height  it  came  to  where  the  air 
was  more  rarefied  and  colder,  and  there  it  was  abandoned  by  the  fire; 
and  the  small  particles  being  pressed  together  were  united  and  became

LOVE  OF  VIRTUE 

The  lark  is  a  bird  of  which  it  is  told  that  if  it  is  taken  into  the  pres- 
ence of  anyone  who  is  ill,  then  if  the  sick  person  is  going  to  die  the 
bird  turns  away  its  head  and  does  not  look  at  him.  But  if  the  sick  per- 
son is  going  to  recover,  the  bird  never  takes  its  eyes  off  him,  and  is  the 
cause  of  all  his  sickness  leaving  him.  Similarly  the  love  of  virtue  never 
regards  a  mean  or  bad  thing,  but  always  rather  dwells  among  things 
honest  and  virtuous,  and  repatriates  itself  in  noble  hearts  like  birds  in 
green  forests  upon  flowery  branches.  And  this  love  reveals  itself  more 
in  adversity  than  in  prosperity,  acting  as  does  light  which  shines  most 
where  it  finds  the  darkest  spot.1  h  5  r. 

ENVY 

Of  the  kite  one  reads  that  when  it  sees  that  its  children  in  the  nest 
are  too  fat  it  pecks  their  sides  out  of  envy  and  keeps  them  without 
food. 

CHEERFULNESS 

Cheerfulness  is  characteristic  of  the  cock,  for  it  rejoices  over  every 
little  thing  and  sings  with  varied  and  joyous  movements.

SADNESS 

Sadness  may  be  compared  to  the  raven,  which  on  seeing  its  newborn 
children  white,  departs  with  great  grief  and  abandons  them  with  sad 
lamentations,  and  does  not  give  them  any  food  until  it  discerns  a  few 
black  feathers.  h  5  v. 

PEACE 

Of  the  beaver  one  reads  that  when  it  is  pursued,  knowing  this  to  be 
on  account  of  the  virtue  of  its  testicles  for  medicinal  uses,  not  being 
able  to  flee  any  farther  it  stops,  and  in  order  to  be  at  peace  with  its 
pursuers  bites  off  its  testicles  with  its  sharp  teeth  and  leaves  them  to  its 
enemies. 

ANGER 

It  is  said  of  the  bear  that  when  he  goes  to  the  beehives  to  take  the 
honey  from  them,  the  bees  commence  to  sting  him,  so  that  he  leaves 
the  honey  and  rushes  to  avenge  himself;  and  wishing  to  take  venge- 
ance upon  all  those  who  are  biting  him  he  fails  to  take  vengeance 
on  any,  with  result  that  his  course  becomes  changed  to  frenzy,  and  in 
his  exasperation  he  throws  himself  upon  the  ground,  vainly  trying  to 
defend  himself  with  his  hands  and  feet.  h  6  r. 


GRATITUDE 

The  virtue  of  gratitude  is  said  to  be  found  especially  in  the  birds 
called  hoopoes,  which  being  conscious  of  the  benefits  they  have  re- 
ceived from  father  and  mother  in  life  and  nourishment,  when  they 
see  these  becoming  old  make  a  nest  for  them  and  cherish  them  and 
feed  them,  plucking  out  their  old  and  shabby  feathers  with  their  beaks, 
and  by  means  of  certain  herbs  restoring  their  sight,  so  that  they  return 
to  a  state  of  prosperity. 

AVARICE 

The  toad  feeds  on  earth  and  always  remains  lean  because  it  never 
satisfies  itself,  so  great  is  its  fear  lest  the  supply  of  earth  should  fail.

INGRATITUDE 


The  pigeons  serve  as  a  symbol  of  ingratitude;  for  when  they  are  of 
an  age  no  longer  to  have  need  of  being  fed,  they  commence  to  fight 
with  their  father,  and  the  combat  does  not  end  until  the  young  one 
has  driven  his  father  out  and  taken  his  wife  and  made  her  his  own. 


CRUELTY 

The  basilisk  is  so  exceedingly  cruel  that  when  it  cannot  kill  animals 
with  the  venom  of  its  gaze  it  turns  towards  the  herbs  and  plants,  and 
looking  fixedly  upon  them  makes  them  wither  up.  h  7  r. 

MAGNANIMITY 

Of  the  eagle  it  is  said  that  it  never  has  so  great  a  hunger  that  it  does 
not  leave  of  its  prey  to  those  birds  which  are  round  about;  and  as  these 
are  not  able  to  forage  for  themselves  it  is  necessary  that  they  pay  court 
to  the  eagle,  since  by  this  means  they  are  fed. 

CORRECTION 

If  the  wolf  while  prowling  warily  round  some  cattle-stall  should 
chance  to  set  his  foot  in  a  trap  so  that  he  makes  a  noise,  he  bites  his 
foot  ofif  in  order  to  punish  himself  for  his  mistake.  h  7  v. 

BLANDISHMENTS 

The  siren  sings  so  sweetly  as  to  lull  the  mariners  to  sleep,  and  then 
she  climbs  upon  the  ships  and  kills  the  sleeping  mariners. 

PRUDENCE 

The  ant  from  its  natural  sagacity  provides  in  the  summer  for  the 
winter,  killing  the  seeds  after  having  gathered  them,  in  order  that  they 
may  not  germinate,  and  then  in  time  it  eats  them. 


A   BESTIARY  1077 

MADNESS 

As  the  wild  bull  hates  the  colour  red  the  hunters  drape  in  red  the 
trunk  of  a  tree,  and  the  bull  charges  it  furiously  and  gets  his  horns 
fixed  in  it,  and  then  the  huntsmen  kill  him.  h  8  r. 


JUSTICE 

We  may  compare  the  virtue  of  justice  to  the  king  of  the  bees,  who 
orders  and  arranges  everything  on  a  system,  because  some  bees  are 
ordered  to  go  among  the  flowers,  others  are  ordered  to  work,  others  to 
fight  with  the  wasps,  others  to  take  away  the  dirt,  others  to  accompany 
and  attend  the  king.  And  when  he  becomes  old  and  has  no  wings 
they  carry  him,  and  if  any  one  of  them  fail  in  his  duty  he  is  punished 
without  any  forgiveness. 

TRUTH 

Although  partridges  steal  each  other's  eggs  nevertheless  the  children 
born  from  these  eggs  always  return  to  their  true  mother.         h  8  v. 


FIDELITY  OR  LOYALTY 

The  cranes  are  so  faithful  and  loyal  to  their  king  that  at  night  when 
he  is  asleep  some  pace  up  and  down  the  meadow  to  keep  guard  over 
him  from  a  distance;  others  stand  near  at  hand,  and  each  holds  a  stone 
in  his  foot,  so  that  if  sleep  should  overcome  them  the  stone  would  fall 
and  make  such  a  noise  that  they  would  be  wakened  up.  There  are 
others  who  sleep  together  around  the  king,  and  they  do  this  every 
night  taking  it  in  turn  so  that  their  king  may  not  come  to  find  them 
wanting. 

DECEIT 

The  fox  when  he  sees  a  flock  of  magpies  or  jackdaws  or  birds  of  this 
kind,  instantly  throws  himself  on  the  ground  with  mouth  open  in  such 
a  way  as  to  seem  dead:  the  birds  think  to  peck  at  his  tongue  and  he 
bites  off  their  heads.  h  9  r.

A  LIE 

The  mole  has  very  small  eyes  and  always  remains  underground;  it 
lives  as  long  as  it  stays  in  concealment,  and  as  soon  as  ever  it  comes  to 
the  light  it  instantly  dies,  because  it  becomes  known — So  it  is  with 
a  lie. 

FORTITUDE 

The  lion  never  feels  fear;  on  the  contrary  it  fights  with  a  stout  heart 
in  fierce  combat  against  the  crowd  of  hunters,  always  seeking  to  injure 
the  first  who  has  injured  him. 

FEAR  OR  COWARDICE 

The  hare  is  always  timid,  and  the  leaves  that  fall  from  the  trees  in 
autumn  keep  it  always  in  fear  and  often  cause  it  to  flee.        h  9  v. 

MAGNANIMITY 

The  falcon  only  preys  on  large  birds,  and  it  would  let  itself  die  before 
it  would  feed  on  the  young  or  eat  putrid  flesh. 

VAINGLORY 

As  regards  this  vice  we  read  of  the  peacock  being  more  subject  to  it 
than  any  other  creature,  because  it  is  always  contemplating  the  beauty 
of  its  tail,  spreading  it  out  in  the  form  of  a  wheel  and  attracting  to 
itself  by  its  cries  the  attention  of  the  surrounding  animals. 

And  this  is  the  last  vice  that  can  be  conquered.  h  10  r. 

CONSTANCY 

For  constancy  the  phoenix  serves  as  a  type;  for  understanding  by 
nature  its  renewal  it  is  steadfast  to  endure  the  burning  flames  which 
consume  it,  and  then  it  is  reborn  anew. 

INCONSTANCY 

The  swift  is  put  for  inconstancy,  for  it  is  always  in  movement,  since 
it  cannot  endure  the  slightest  discomfort.

TEMPERANCE 

The  camel  is  the  most  lustful  animal  that  there  is,  and  it  will  follow 
the  female  a  thousand  miles,  but  if  it  lived  continually  with  its  mother 
or  sister  it  would  never  touch  them,  so  well  does  it  know  how  to 
control  itself.  hiov. 

INTEMPERANCE 

The  unicorn  through  its  lack  of  temperance,  and  because  it  does  not 
know  how  to  control  itself  for  the  delight  that  it  has  for  young  maidens, 
forgets  its  ferocity  and  wildness;  and  laying  aside  all  fear  it  goes  up  to 
the  seated  maiden  and  goes  to  sleep  in  her  lap,  and  in  this  way  the 
hunters  take  it. 

HUMILITY 

Of  humility  one  sees  the  supreme  instance  in  the  lamb,  which  sub- 
mits itself  to  every  animal.  And  when  they  are  given  as  food  to  lions 
in  captivity  they  submit  themselves  to  them  as  to  their  own  mothers, 
in  such  a  way  that  it  has  often  been  seen  that  the  lions  are  unwilling 
to  kill  them.  h  n  r. 

PRIDE 

The  falcon  from  its  haughtiness  and  pride  thinks  to  overcome  and 
lord  it  over  all  the  other  birds  of  prey,  because  it  wishes  to  reign  alone: 
and  many  times  the  falcon  has  been  seen  to  attack  the  eagle  the  queen 
of  birds. 

ABSTINENCE 

The  wild  ass  if  when  going  to  the  spring  to  drink  it  should  find  the 
water  muddy,  has  never  so  great  a  thirst  as  to  cause  it  not  to  abstain 
from  drinking  and  wait  until  the  water  grows  clear. 


GLUTTONY 

The  vulture  is  so  given  up  to  gluttony  that  it  would  go  a  thousand 
miles  in  order  to  feed  on  carrion,  and  this  is  why  it  follows  armies. 


:o8o  A   BESTIARY 


CHASTITY 


The  turtle-dove  never  wrongs  its  mate;  and  if  the  one  dies  the  other 
observes  perpetual  chastity,  and  never  rests  upon  a  green  branch  or 
drinks  of  clear  water. 

LEWDNESS 

The  bat  by  reason  of  its  unbridled  lewdness  does  not  follow  any 
natural  law  in  pairing,  but  male  goes  with  male,  female  with  female, 
as  they  chance  to  find  themselves  together. 

MODERATION 

The  ermine  because  of  its  moderation  eats  only  once  a  day,  and  it 
allows  itself  to  be  captured  by  the  hunters  rather  than  take  refuge  in  a 
muddy  lair,  in  order  not  to  stain  its  purity.  h  12  r. 

THE  EAGLE 

The  eagle  when  it  is  old  flies  so  high  that  it  scorches  its  feathers; 
and  nature  consents  that  it  renews  its  youth  by  falling  into  shallow 
water. 

And  if  its  young  ones  cannot  bear  to  gaze  at  the  sun  it  does  not  feed 
them.  No  bird  that  does  not  wish  to  die  should  approach  its  nest.  The 
animals  go  much  in  fear  of  it  but  it  does  not  harm  them.  It  always 
leaves  them  a  portion  of  its  prey. 

THE  LUMERPA.  FAME 

This  is  born  in  Asia  Magna  and  shines  so  brightly  that  it  absorbs  its 
shadows.  And  in  dying  it  does  not  lose  this  light,  and  the  feathers 
never  fall  out.  And  the  feather  which  is  detached  ceases  to  shine. 


THE  PELICAN 

This  bears  a  great  love  to  its  young;  and  if  it  finds  them  slain  in  the 
nest  by  a  serpent  it  pierces  itself  to  the  heart  in  their  presence,  and  by 
bathing  them  with  a  shower  of  blood  it  restores  them  to  life.

THE  SALAMANDER 


The  salamander  in  the  fire  refines  its  rough  skin. — For  virtue. 
It  has  no  digestive  organs  and  does  not  seek  any  other  nourishment 
than  fire,  and  often  in  this  it  renews  its  rough  skin. 

THE  CHAMELEON 

This  lives  on  air  and  it  is  there  at  the  mercy  of  all  the  birds.  And  in 
order  to  be  safer  it  flies  above  the  clouds,  and  there  finds  an  air  that  is 
so  rarefied  as  to  be  incapable  of  supporting  any  bird  that  would  follow 
it. 

At  this  height  there  flies  nothing  save  that  to  whom  it  is  given  by 
the  heavens:  it  is  there  that  the  chameleon  flies.  h  13  r. 

ALEPO.  FISH 
The  alepo  cannot  live  out  of  water. 

OSTRICH 

For  armies,  food  of  commanders. 

It  extracts  nourishment  from  iron;  hatches  eggs  by  its  gaze. 

SWAN 

The  swan  is  white  without  any  spot,  and  sings  sweetly  as  it  dies;  this 
song  ends  its  life. 

STORK 

It  cures  itself  of  sickness  by  drinking  salt  water.  If  it  finds  its  com- 
panion in  fault  it  abandons  her.  When  it  is  old  its  young  ones  brood 
over  it  and  nourish  it  until  it  dies.  h  13  v. 

GRASSHOPPER 

This  with  its  song  puts  the  cuckoo  to  silence.  It  dies  in  oil  and  is 
revived  in  vinegar.  It  sings  through  the  burning  heats.

BAT 

For  vice  which  cannot  endure  where  virtue  is. 

This  loses  its  sight  more  where  the  light  has  more  radiance,  and  be- 
comes more  blinded  the  more  it  looks  at  the  sun. 

PARTRIDGE 

This  changes  from  female  to  male  and  forgets  its  former  sex.  Out 
of  envy  it  steals  the  eggs  of  others  and  hatches  them,  but  the  young 
ones  follow  their  true  mother. 

SWALLOW 

This  by  means  of  celandine  opens  the  eyes  of  its  little  ones  when 
blind.  h  14  r. 

OYSTER— FOR  TREASON 

This  opens  completely  when  the  moon  is  full:  and  when  the  crab 
sees  it  it  throws  a  piece  of  stone  or  a  twig  into  it  and  thus  prevents  it 
from  closing  up,  so  that  it  serves  the  crab  for  a  meal. 

So  it  may  be  with  the  mouth  when  it  tells  its  secret,  that  it  puts  itself 
at  the  mercy  of  the  indiscreet  listener. 

BASILISK— CRUELTY 

This  is  shunned  by  all  the  serpents;  the  weasel  fights  with  it  by 
means  of  rue  and  slays  it.  Rue  for  virtue. 


ASP 

This  carries  sudden  death  in  its  fangs;  and  in  order  not  to  hear  the 
enchantments  it  stops  up  its  ears  with  its  tail.  h  14  v. 

DRAGON 

This  twines  itself  round  the  legs  of  the  elephant,  and  it  falls  upon 
him  and  both  die.  And  in  dying  it  has  its  revenge. 


A  BESTIARY  1083 

VIPER 

This  in  pairing  buries  her  mouth  and  at  the  end  clenches  her  teeth 
and  kills  her  husband;  afterwards  the  sons  having  waxed  big  within 
her  body  tear  open  her  belly  and  slay  their  mother. 


SCORPION 

The  saliva  spat  out  upon  the  scorpion  when  fasting  slays  it  after  tht 
manner  of  abstinence  from  gluttony,  which  carries  away  and  puts  an 
end  to  the  illnesses  that  proceed  from  this  gluttony,  and  opens  the  path 
to  the  virtues.  h  15  r. 

CROCODILE— HYPOCRISY 

This  animal  seizes  a  man  and  instantly  kills  him;  and  after  he  is 
dead  it  mourns  for  him  with  a  piteous  voice  and  many  tears,  and 
having  ended  its  lament  it  cruelly  devours  him.  It  is  thus  with  the 
hypocrite,  whose  face  is  bathed  with  tears  over  every  slight  thing, 
showing  himself  thus  to  have  the  heart  of  a  tiger;  he  rejoices  in  his 
heart  over  another's  misfortunes  with  a  face  bedewed  with  tears. 


TOAD 

The  toad  shuns  the  light  of  the  sun:  if  however  it  be  kept  in  it  by 
force  it  pufTs  itself  out  so  much  as  to  hide  its  head  below  and  deprives 
itself  of  its  rays.  So  acts  whoever  is  the  enemy  of  clear  and  radiant 
virtue,  who  cannot  maintain  itself  in  its  presence  save  by  force,  with 
puffed-up  courage.  h  17  r. 


THE  CATERPILLAR— FOR  VIRTUE  IN  GENERAL 

The  caterpillar  which  through  the  care  exercised  in  weaving  round

manship, afterwards  emerges  from  it  with  beautiful  painted  wings,  ris-

THE  SPIDER 

The  spider  brings  forth  out  of  herself  the  delicate  and  subtle  web 
which  gives  back  to  it  as  its  reward  the  prey  that  it  has  taken. 

h  17  v. 

THE  LION 

This  animal  with  its  resounding  roar  rouses  its  cubs  on  the  third  day 
after  their  birth  and  teaches  them  the  use  of  all  their  dormant  senses, 
and  all  the  wild  creatures  which  are  in  the  forest  flee  away. 

One  may  liken  these  to  the  children  of  virtue  who  are  wakened  by 
the  sound  of  praise:  their  studies  grow  in  distinction,  raising  them 
continually  more  and  more,  and  at  the  sound  all  that  is  evil  flees  away, 
shunning  those  who  are  virtuous. 

The  lion  also  covers  over  his  tracks  so  as  to  leave  nothing  to  indicate 
his  course  to  his  enemies.  So  it  is  well  for  captains  that  they  should 
conceal  the  secrets  of  their  minds,  in  order  that  the  enemy  may  have 
no  conception  of  their  plans.  h  18  r. 

TARANTULA 

The  bite  of  the  tarantula  fixes  a  man  in  his  purpose,  that  is  in  what 
he  was  thinking  about  when  he  was  bitten. 

LONG-EARED  OWL  AND  LITTLE  OWL 

These  punish  those  who  have  a  skirmish  with  them  by  depriving 
them  of  life;  and  nature  has  so  ordained  in  order  that  they  may  be  fed. 

h  18  v. 

THE  ELEPHANT 

The  great  elephant  has  by  nature  qualities  which  rarely  occur  among 
men,  namely  probity,  prudence,  and  the  sense  of  justice  and  of  re- 
ligious observance.  Consequently  when  there  is  a  new  moon  they  go  to 
the  rivers,  and  there  having  solemnly  purified  themselves  they  proceed 
to  bathe,  and  after  thus  saluting  the  planet  they  go  back  to  the  woods. 
And  when  they  are  ill  they  throw  themselves  upon  their  backs  and 


A   BESTIARY  1085 

toss  up  plants  toward  heaven  as  though  they  wished  to  offer  sacrifice 

They  bury  their  tusks  when  they  drop  out  from  old  age.  Of  these  two 
tusks  they  use  one  to  dig  up  roots  in  order  to  feed  themselves  and  keep 
the  point  of  the  other  sharp  in  order  to  fight  with  it. 

When  they  are  conquered  by  the  hunters  and  overcome  by  fatigue 
the  elephants  clash  their  tusks,  and  having  thus  broken  them  off  use 
them  for  their  ransom. 

They  are  mild  in  disposition  and  are  conscious  of  dangers. 

If  one  of  them  should  come  upon  a  man  alone  who  has  lost  his  way 
he  puts  him  back  peacefully  in  the  path  from  which  he  has  wandered. 
If  he  should  come  upon  the  man's  footprints  before  he  sees  him  he 
fears  a  snare,  and  so  he  stops  and  blows  through  his  trunk  as  he  shows 
them  to  the  other  elephants;  and  these  then  form  themselves  into  a 
company  and  advance  cautiously. 

These  animals  always  proceed  in  companies.  The  oldest  goes  in 
front  and  the  next  oldest  remains  the  last,  and  thus  they  enclose  the 
company. 

They  fear  shame  and  only  pair  at  night  and  secretly,  and  do  not 
rejoin  the  herd  after  pairing  until  they  have  first  bathed  themselves  in 
the  river. 

They  do  not  fight  over  their  females  as  other  creatures  do. 

It  is  so  peaceable  that  its  nature  does  not  allow  it  willingly  to  injure 
creatures  less  powerful  than  itself.  If  it  should  chance  to  meet  a  drove 
or  flock  of  sheep  it  puts  them  aside  with  its  trunk  so  as  to  avoid 
trampling  upon  them  with  its  feet;  and  it  never  injures  others  unless 
it  is  provoked.  When  one  of  them  has  fallen  into  a  pit  the  others 
fill  the  pit  with  branches,  earth  and  stones,  so  that  they  raise  the  floor 
in  such  a  way  that  it  may  easily  make  its  escape.  They  have  a  great 
dread  of  the  grunting  of  pigs  and  retreat  hastily  before  it,  causing  no 
less  damage  with  their  feet  to  each  other  than  to  their  enemies.  They 
delight  in  rivers  and  are  always  wandering  about  in  their  vicinity;  but 
on  account  of  their  great  weight  they  are  unable  to  swim.  They  devour 
stones,  and  the  trunks  of  trees  are  their  most  welcome  food.  They  hate 
rats.  Flies  are  much  attracted  by  their  smell,  and  as  they  settle  on  their 
backs  they  wrinkle  up  their  skin,  deepening  its  tight  folds,  and  so  kill 
them. 

When  they  are  crossing  rivers  they  send  their  young  towards  the

fall  of  the  stream,  and  standing  themselves  up  stream  they  break  the 
united  course  of  the  water  so  that  the  current  may  not  carry  them 
away. 

The  dragon  throws  itself  under  the  elephant's  body,  twines  its  tail 
round  its  legs  and  clings  to  its  ribs  with  wings  and  claws  and  bites  open 
its  throat.  The  elephant  falls  on  top  of  it  and  the  dragon  bursts  open; 
thus  it  revenges  itself  by  the  death  of  its  enemy.

THE  DRAGON 

These  band  themselves  together  in  companies  and  twine  after  the

SERPENTS 

The  serpent,  a  very  large  animal,  when  it  sees  a  bird  in  the  air 
inhales  its  breath  with  such  vigour  as  to  draw  the  birds  into  its  mouth. 
Marcus  Regulus  the  Consul  of  the  Roman  army  was  with  his  army 
attacked  by  such  a  monster  and  almost  routed.  After  the  creature  had 
been  slain  by  a  catapult  it  was  found  to  measure  a  hundred  and 
twenty-five  feet,  that  is  sixty-four  and  a  half  braccia  i1  its  head  towered 
above  all  the  trees  in  a  wood.  h  21  r. 

THE  BOA 

This  is  a  great  snake  which  twines  itself  round  the  legs  of  the  cow 
in  such  a  way  that  it  cannot  move,  and  then  it  sucks  it  so  as  almost  to 
dry  it  up.  One  of  the  species  was  killed  on  the  hill  of  the  Vatican  in 
the  time  of  the  Emperor  Claudius,  and  it  had  a  whole  boy  inside  it 
whom  it  had  swallowed.  h  21  r.  and  v. 


THE  ELK— CAPTURED  WHEN  ASLEEP 

This  beast  is  a  native  of  the  island  of  Scandinavia.  It  has  the  shape 
of  a  great  horse  except  for  the  differences  caused  by  the  great  length  of

the  neck  and  ears.  It  crops  the  grass  going  backwards,  for  its  upper  lip 
is  so  long  that  if  it  were  to  feed  while  going  forward  it  would  cover 
up  the  grass.  It  has  its  legs  without  any  joints  and  so  when  it  wishes 
to  go  to  sleep  it  leans  against  a  tree;  and  the  hunters  after  having  re- 
connoitred the  spot  at  which  it  is  accustomed  to  sleep  saw  the  tree 
almost  through,  and  when  afterwards  it  leans  against  it  as  it  sleeps  it 
falls  in  its  sleep  and  so  the  hunters  take  it.  Every  other  method  of 
capturing  it  is  bound  to  fail  because  it  runs  with  incredible  speed.

BON  ASUS— IT  INJURES  AS  IT  FLIES 

This  is  a  native  of  Paconia,  and  it  has  a  neck  with  a  mane  like  a 
horse:  in  all  other  respects  it  resembles  a  bull  except  that  its  horns  bend 
inwards  to  such  an  extent  that  it  cannot  butt  with  them.  This  is  why 
its  only  refuge  is  in  flight,  in  which  it  voids  its  excrement  a  distance  of 
four  hundred  braccia  from  its  course,  and  wherever  this  touches  it 
burns  like  fire. 

LIONS,  LEOPARDS,  PANTHERS,  TIGERS 

These  keep  their  claws  in  sheath  and  never  put  them  out  except 
when  on  the  back  of  their  prey  or  an  enemy. 

LIONESS 

When  the  lioness  defends  her  cubs  from  the  hands  of  the  hunters, 
in  order  not  to  be  affrighted  by  the  spears  she  lowers  her  eyes  to  the 
ground,  so  that  her  cubs  may  not  be  taken  prisoners  through  her  flight.

LION 

This  animal  which  is  so  terrible  fears  nothing  more  than  the  noise 
of  empty  carts  and  in  like  manner  the  crowing  of  cocks,  and  when  it 
sees  these  it  is  much  terrified,  gazes  at  their  combs  with  a  look  of  fear 
and  is  strangely  perturbed  even  though  its  face  is  covered. 

THE  PANTHER  IN  AFRICA 

This  has  the  shape  of  a  lioness,  but  it  is  taller  in  the  leg  and  slimmer 
and  longer  and  quite  white,  marked  with  black  spots  after  the  manner

of  rosettes;  all  the  animals  are  fascinated  by  these  as  they  gaze  at  them 
and  they  would  remain  standing  there  always  if  it  were  not  for  the 
terror  of  its  face;  being  conscious  of  this  therefore  it  hides  its  face,  and 
the  animals  that  are  round  about  it  take  courage  and  draw  near  so  as 
to  be  able  the  better  to  enjoy  so  much  beauty:  it  then  suddenly  seizes 
on  the  nearest  and  instantly  devours  it.  h  22  v.  and  23  r. 

CAMELS 

The  Bactrian  have  two  humps,  the  Arabian  one.  They  are  swift  in 
battle  and  very  useful  for  carrying  burdens.  This  animal  is  a  great 
observer  of  rule  and  proportion,  for  it  does  not  move  at  all  if  its  load 
is  larger  than  it  is  accustomed  to,  and  if  it  is  taken  too  long  a  journey  it 
does  the  same  and  stops  suddenly,  so  that  the  merchants  are  obliged  to 
make  their  lodging  there.  h  23  r. 

TIGER 

This  is  a  native  of  Hyrcania;  it  bears  some  resemblance  to  the  pan- 
ther from  the  various  spots  on  its  skin;  and  it  is  an  animal  of  terrifying 
speed.  When  the  hunter  finds  its  cubs  he  carries  them  off  instantly, 
after  placing  mirrors  at  the  spot  from  which  he  has  taken  them,  and 
then  immediately  takes  to  flight  upon  a  swift  horse. 

The  panther  when  it  returns  finds  the  mirrors  fixed  to  the  ground 
and  in  looking  at  these  it  thinks  that  it  sees  its  own  children,  until  by 
scratching  with  its  paw  it  discovers  the  fraud  and  then  following  the 
scent  of  its  cubs  it  pursues  the  hunter.  And  as  soon  as  the  hunter  sees 
the  tigress  he  abandons  one  of  the  cubs,  and  this  she  takes  and  carries 
it  to  her  lair  and  instantly  sets  off  again  after  the  hunter,  and  this  is 
repeated  until  he  gains  his  boat.  h  23  v.  and  24  r. 

CATOBLEPAS 

It  is  found  in  Ethiopia  near  to  the  principal  source  of  the  Niger. 
It  is  an  animal  which  is  not  very  large.  It  is  sluggish  in  all  its  limbs 
and  has  the  head  so  large  that  it  carries  it  awkwardly,  in  such  a  way 
that  it  is  always  inclined  towards  the  ground;  otherwise  it  would  be 
a  very  great  pest  to  mankind,  for  anyone  on  whom  it  fixes  its  eyes  dies 
instantly.  h  24  r.

BASILISK 

It  is  found  in  the  province  of  Cyrenaica  and  is  not  more  than  twelve 
fingers  long.  It  has  a  white  spot  on  its  head  of  the  shape  of  a  diadem. 
It  drives  away  every  serpent  by  its  whistling.  It  resembles  a  snake  but 
does  not  move  by  wriggling,  but  extends  itself  straight  forward  from 
its  centre.  It  is  said  that  on  one  occasion  when  one  of  these  was  killed 
by  a  horseman's  spear  and  its  venom  flowed  over  the  spear,  not  only 
the  man  died  but  the  horse  did  also.  It  spoils  the  corn,  not  only  that 
which  it  touches  but  that  upon  which  it  breathes;  it  scorches  the  grass 
and  splits  the  stones.  h  24  r.  and  v. 

WEASEL 

This  on  finding  the  den  of  the  basilisk  kills  it  with  the  smell  of  its 
urine  by  spreading  this  about,  and  the  smell  of  this  urine  often  kills 
the  weasel  itself. 

THE  CERASTE 

These  have  four  small  movable  horns;  and  when  they  wish  to  feed 
they  hide  the  whole  of  their  body  except  these  tiny  horns  under  the 
leaves,  and  as  they  move  these  it  seems  to  the  birds  that  they  are  little 
worms  wriggling  about,  and  so  they  instantly  descend  and  peck  at 
them.  And  then  the  ceraste  immediately  wraps  itself  round  them  in  a 
circle  and  so  devours  them.  h  24  v. 

AMPHISBOENA 

This  has  two  heads,  one  in  its  usual  place  the  other  at  its  tail,  as 
though  it  was  not  sufficient  for  it  to  throw  its  poison  from  one  place 
only. 

JACULO 

This  stations  itself  in  trees  and  hurls  itself  like  a  dart,  and  transfixes 
the  wild  beasts  and  slays  them. 

THE  ASP 

There  is  no  remedy  for  the  bite  of  this  animal  except  instantly  to 
cut  away  the  part  affected.  Pestilential  though  it  is  this  animal  has  so 
strong  an  affection  for  its  companion  that  they  always  go  in  pairs.  And

if  by  a  mischance  one  of  them  should  be  slain  the  other  pursues  the 
murderer  with  incredible  speed,  and  is  so  alert  and  eager  for  venge- 
ance as  to  overcome  every  obstacle.  It  will  pass  through  a  whole 
troop  seeking  only  to  wound  its  enemy,  traversing  any  distance,  and 
the  only  ways  of  avoiding  it  are  by  crossing  over  water  or  by  a  very 
rapid  flight.  Its  eyes  turn  inwards  and  it  has  large  ears,  and  its  hearing 
guides  it  more  than  its  sight.  h  25  r. 

ICHNEUMON 

This  animal  is  the  mortal  enemy  of  the  asp.  It  is  a  native  of  Egypt, 
and  when  it  sees  an  asp  near  to  its  place  it  runs  instantly  to  the  mud 
or  slime  of  the  Nile  and  covers  itself  with  it  entirely,  and  then  after 
drying  itself  in  the  sun  smears  itself  again  with  mud,  and  thus  drying 
itself  time  after  time  covers  itself  with  three  or  four  coats  like  coats  of 
mail;  after  this  it  attacks  the  asp  and  struggles  with  it  determinedly, 
until  it  seizes  its  opportunity  and  flies  at  its  throat  and  chokes  it.

CROCODILE 

This  is  a  native  of  the  Nile.  It  has  four  feet  and  is  dangerous  both  on 
land  and  in  the  water.  It  is  the  only  land  animal  that  is  without  a 
tongue,  and  it  bites  merely  by  moving  its  upper  jaw.  It  grows  to  a 
length  of  forty  feet,  it  has  claws,  and  is  covered  with  hide  that  will 
withstand  any  blow.  It  remains  on  land  by  day  and  in  the  water  by 
night.  When  it  has  had  its  meal  of  fish  it  goes  to  sleep  on  the  bank  of 
the  Nile  with  its  mouth  open,  and  then  the  bird  called  trochilus,  a 
very  small  bird,  runs  immediately  to  its  mouth,  and  hopping  about 
among  its  teeth  in  and  out  proceeds  to  peck  at  the  remains  of  its  food, 
and  causing  it  entrancing  pleasure  thereby  tempts  it  to  open  its  mouth 
more  widely,  and  in  so  doing  it  falls  asleep.  No  sooner  does  the  ichneu- 
mon perceive  this  than  it  flings  itself  into  its  mouth,  pierces  its  stomach 
and  intestines,  and  so  finally  kills  it.  h  25  v.  and  26  r. 

DOLPHIN 

Nature  has  given  such  power  of  understanding  to  animals  that  in 
addition  to  the  perception  of  what  is  to  their  own  advantage  they

know  what  is  to  the  disadvantage  of  the  enemy;  as  a  consequence  the 
dolphin  knows  both  the  power  of  a  cut  from  the  fins  which  it  has  on 
its  hack,  and  the  tenderness  of  the  belly  of  the  crocodile,  hence  when 
they  fight  it  glides  underneath  it,  pierces  its  belly  and  so  kills  it. 

The  crocodile  is  terrifying  to  those  who  flee  from  him  and  an  utter 
coward  when  he  is  being  pursued.  h  26  r. 

HIPPOPOTAMUS 

This  when  it  feels  itself  becoming  overloaded  looks  about  for  thorns 
or  where  there  are  the  fragments  of  split  canes,  and  there  it  rubs  a  vein 
so  hard  as  to  burst  it  open,  and  then  having  allowed  as  much  blood  to 
flow  as  may  be  necessary  it  besmears  itself  with  mud  and  so  plasters  up 
the  wound.  It  has  almost  the  shape  of  a  horse,  with  cloven  hoofs, 
twisted  tail,  boar's  tusks,  and  neck  with  flowing  mane.  The  hide 
cannot  be  pierced  except  when  it  is  bathing.  It  feeds  on  corn  that 
grows  in  the  fields,  and  makes  its  way  into  them  backwards,  so  that 
it  may  appear  that  it  has  just  emerged. 

IBIS 

This  bears  a  resemblance  to  a  stork,  and  when  it  feels  ill  it  fills  its 
crop  with  water  and  makes  an  injection  with  its  beak.

If  you  shall  choose  pleasure,  know  that  he  has  behind  him  one  who 
will  deal  out  to  you  tribulation  and  repentance. 

This  is  pleasure  together  with  pain,  and  they  are  represented  as  twins 
because  the  one  is  never  separated  from  the  other. 

They  are  made  with  their  backs  turned  to  each  other  because  they 
are  contrary  the  one  to  the  other.  They  are  made  growing  out  of  the 
same  trunk  because  they  have  one  and  the  same  foundation,  for  the 
foundation  of  pleasure  is  labour  with  pain,  and  the  foundations  of  pain 
are  vain1  and  lascivious  pleasures. 

And  accordingly  it  is  represented  here  with  a  reed  in  the  right  hand, 
which  is  useless  and  without  strength,  and  the  wounds  made  with  it 
are  poisoned.  In  Tuscany  reeds  are  put  to  support  beds,  to  signify  that 
here  occur  vain  dreams,  and  here  is  consumed  a  great  part  of  life:  here 
is  squandered  much  useful  time,  namely  that  of  the  morning  when  the 
mind  is  composed  and  refreshed,  and  the  body  therefore  is  fitted  to 
resume  new  labours.  There  also  are  taken  many  vain  pleasures,  both 
with  the  mind  imagining  impossible  things,  and  with  the  body  taking 
those  pleasures  which  are  often  the  cause  of  the  failing  of  life;  so  that 
for  this  the  reed  is  held  as  representing  such  foundations.

XLV 
Prophecies 

'Creatures  shall  be  seen  upon  the  earth  who  will  al- 
ways be  fighting  one  with  another,  with  very  great 
losses  and  frequent  deaths  on  either  side.  These  shall 
set  no  bounds  to  their  malice  ...  0  Earth!  what 
delays  thee  to  open  and  hurl  them  headlong  into 
the  deep  fissures  of  thy  huge  abysses  and  caverns, 
and  no  longer  to  display  in  the  sight  of  heaven  so 
savage  and  ruthless  a  monster?' 

COMMON  HABIT 

Some  poor  wretch  will  be  flattered,  and  these  same  flatterers  will  al- 
ways be  to  him  deceivers,  robbers  and  assassins. 

THE  PERCUSSION  OF  THE  SUN'S  DISC 

Something  will  appear  which  will  cover  over  the  person  who  shall 
attempt  to  cover  it. 

OF  MONEY  AND  GOLD 

That  shall  come  forth  from  hollow  caves  which  shall  cause  all  the 
nations  of  the  world  to  toil  and  sweat  with  great  agitation,  anxiety  and 
labour,  in  order  to  gain  its  aid. 

OF  THE  FEAR  OF  POVERTY 

The  malevolent  and  terrifying  thing  shall  of  itself  strike  such  terror 
into  men  that  almost  like  madmen,  while  thinking  to  escape  from  it, 
they  will  rush  in  swift  course  upon  its  boundless  forces. 

OF  ADVICE 

He  who  shall  be  most  necessary  to  whoever  has  need  of  him  will  be 
unknown,  and  if  known  will  be  held  of  less  account.         c.a.  37  v.  c

PROPHECIES  1099 

OF  SNAKES  CARRIED  BY  SWANS 

Serpents  of  huge  size  will  be  seen  at  an  immense  height  in  the  air 
fighting  with  birds. 


OF  CANNON  WHICH  COME  FORTH  OUT  OF  A  PIT 
AND  FROM  A  MOULD 

There  shall  come  forth  from  beneath  the  ground  that  which  by  its 
terrific  report  shall  stun  all  who  are  near  it,  and  cause  men  to  drop 
dead  at  its  breath,  and  it  shall  devastate  cities  and  castles. 

c.a.  129  v.  a 

OF  CHRISTIANS 

There  are  many  who  hold  the  faith  of  the  Son  and  only  build 
temples  in  the  name  of  the  Mother. 

OF  FOOD  WHICH  HAS  BEEN  ALIVE 

A  large  part  of  the  bodies  which  have  had  life  will  pass  into  the 
bodies  of  other  animals,  that  is  the  houses  no  longer  inhabited  will 
pass  piece-meal  through  those  which  are  inhabited,  ministering  to  their 
needs  and  bearing  away  with  them  what  is  waste;  that  is  to  say  that 
the  life  of  man  is  made  by  the  things  which  he  eats,  and  these  carry 
with  them  that  part  of  man  which  is  dead. 

OF  MEN  WHO  SLEEP  UPON  PLANKS  MADE  FROM 

TREES 

Men  will  sleep  and  eat  and  make  their  dwelling  among  trees  grown 
in  the  forests  and  the  fields. 

OF  DREAMING 

It  shall  seem  to  men  that  they  see  new  destructions  in  the  sky,  and 
the  flames  descending  therefrom  shall  seem  to  have  taken  flight  and  to 
flee  away  in  terror;  they  shall  hear  creatures  of  every  kind  speaking 
human  language;  they  shall  run  in  a  moment,  in  person,  to  divers 


i  ioo  PROPHECIES 

parts  of  the  world  without  movement;  amidst  the  darkness  they  shall 
see  the  most  radiant  splendours.  O  marvel  of  mankind!  What  frenzy 
has  thus  impelled  you!  You  shall  hold  converse  with  animals  of  every 
species,  and  they  with  you  in  human  language.  You  shall  behold  your- 
selves falling  from  great  heights  without  suffering  any  injury;  the 
torrents  will  bear  you  with  them  as  they  mingle  in  their  rapid  course. 

OF  ANTS 

Many  communities  there  will  be  who  will  hide  themselves  and  their 
young  and  their  victuals  within  gloomy  caverns,  and  there  in  dark 
places  will  sustain  themselves  and  their  families  for  many  months 
without  any  light  either  artificial  or  natural. 

OF  BEES 

And  many  others  will  be  robbed  of  their  store  of  provisions  and 
their  food,  and  by  an  insensate  folk  will  be  cruelly  immersed  and 
drowned.  O  justice  of  God!  why  dost  thou  not  awake  to  behold  thy 
creatures  thus  abused? 


OF  SHEEP,  COWS,  GOATS  AND  THE  LIKE 

From  countless  numbers  will  be  stolen  their  little  children,  and  the 
throats  of  these  shall  be  cut,  and  they  shall  be  quartered  most 
barbarously. 

OF  NUTS,  OLIVES,  ACORNS,  CHESTNUTS,  AND  THE 

LIKE 

Many  children  shall  be  torn  with  pitiless  beatings  out  of  the  very 
arms  of  their  mothers,  and  flung  upon  the  ground  and  then  maimed. 

OF  CHILDREN  WHO  ARE  WRAPPED  IN  SWADDLING 

BANDS 

O  cities  of  the  sea,  I  behold  in  you  your  citizens,  women  as  well  a? 
men,  tightly  bound  with  stout  bonds  around  their  arms  and  legs  by 


PROPHECIES  nor 

folk  who  will  have  no  understanding  of  our  speech;  and  you  will  only 
be  able  to  give  vent  to  your  griefs  and  sense  of  loss  of  liberty  by  mak- 
ing tearful  complaints,  and  sighs,  and  lamentation  one  to  another;  for 
those  who  bind  you  will  not  have  understanding  of  your  speech  nor 
will  you  understand  them. 

OF  CATS  THAT  EAT  RATS 

In  you,  O  cities  of  Africa!  your  own  sons  shall  be  seen  torn  to  pieces 
within  their  own  houses  by  most  cruel  and  savage  animals  of  your 
country. 

OF  ASSES  WHICH  ARE  BEATEN 

O  neglectful  Nature,  wherefore  art  thou  thus  partial,  becoming  to 
some  of  thy  children  a  tender  and  benignant  mother,  to  others  a  most 
cruel  and  ruthless  stepmother?  I  see  thy  children  given  into  slavery  to 
others  without  ever  receiving  any  benefit,  and  in  lieu  of  any  reward  for 
the  services  they  have  done  for  them  they  are  repaid  by  the  severest 
punishments,  and  they  constantly  spend  their  lives  in  the  service  of 
their  oppressor. 

DIVISION  OF  THE  PROPHECIES 

First  of  things  which  relate  to  the  reasoning  animals,  second  those 
which  have  not  the  power  of  reason,  third  of  plants,  fourth  of  cere- 
monies, fifth  of  customs,  sixth  of  propositions,  decrees  or  disputes, 
seventh  of  propositions  contrary  to  Nature  (as  to  speak  of  a  substance 
which  the  more  there  is  taken  from  it  is  the  more  increased),  and 
reserve  the  weighty  propositions  until  the  end,  and  begin  with  those  of 
less  import,  and  show  first  the  evils  and  then  the  punishments,  eight

LIGHTS  AND  BELLS  AND  FOLLOWERS

their  knowledge.  c.a.  145  v.  a

"02  PROPHECIES 


CONJECTURE 


Arrange  in  order  the  months  and  the  ceremonies  which  are  per- 
formed, and  do  this  for  the  day  and  for  the  night. 


OF  REAPERS 

There  will  be  many  who  will  be  moving  one  against  another,  hold- 
ing in  their  hands  the  sharp  cutting  iron.  These  will  not  do  each  other 
any  hurt  other  than  that  caused  by  fatigue,  for  as  one  leans  forward  the 
other  draws  back  an  equal  space;  but  woe  to  him  who  intervenes 
between  them,  for  in  the  end  he  will  be  left  cut  in  pieces. 

OF  SILK-SPINNING 

There  shall  be  heard  mournful  cries  and  loud  shrieks,  hoarse  angry 
voices  of  those  who  are  tortured  and  despoiled  and  at  last  left  naked 
and  motionless;  and  this  shall  be  by  reason  of  the  motive  power  which 
turns  the  whole. 


OF  PLACING  BREAD  WITHIN  THE  MOUTH  OF  THE 
OVEN  AND  DRAWING  IT  OUT  AGAIN 

In  all  the  cities  and  lands  and  castles,  villages  and  houses,  men  will 
be  seen  who  through  desire  of  eating  will  draw  the  very  food  out  of 
each  other's  mouths,  without  their  being  able  to  make  any  resistance. 

OF  PLOUGHED  LAND 

The  earth  will  be  seen  turned  upside  down  and  facing  the  opposite 
hemispheres,  and  laying  bare  the  holes  where  lurk  the  fiercest  animals. 

OF  SOWING 

Then  a  great  part  of  the  men  who  remain  alive  will  throw  out  of 
their  houses  the  victuals  they  have  saved,  as  the  free  booty  of  the  birds 
and  beasts  of  the  field,  without  taking  any  care  of  them. 


PROPHECIES  1 103 

OF  THE  RAINS  WHICH  CAUSE  THE  RIVERS  TO 
BECOME  MUDDY  AND  CARRY  AWAY  THE  SOIL 

There  will  come  from  out  the  sky  that  which  will  transport  a  great 
part  of  Africa  which  lies  beneath  this  sky1  towards  Europe,  and  that  of 
Europe  towards  Africa;  and  those  of  the  provinces  will  mingle  to- 
gether in  great  revolution. 

OF  BRICK-KILNS  AND  LIME-KILNS 

At  the  last  the  earth  will  become  red  after  being  exposed  to  fire  for 
many  days,  and  the  stones  will  become  changed  to  ashes. 

OF  WOOD  THAT  IS  BURNT 
The  trees  and  shrubs  of  the  vast  forests  shall  be  changed  to  ashes. 

OF  BOILED  FISH 

Creatures  of  the  water  will  die  in  boiling  water. 

THE  OLIVES  WHICH  DROP  FROM  THE  OLIVE-TREES 
GIVE  US  THE  OIL  WHICH  MAKES  LIGHT 

There  shall  descend  with  fury  from  the  direction  of  the  sky  that 
which  will  give  us  nourishment  and  light. 

OF  HORNED  AND  TAWNY  OWLS  WITH  WHICH  ONE 
GOES  FOWLING  WITH  BIRD-LIME 

Many  will  perish  by  fracturing  their  skulls,  and  their  eyes  will 
almost  start  out  of  their  heads  on  account  of  fearsome  creatures  which 
have  come  forth  out  of  the  darkness. 

OF  FLAX  WHEREBY  PAPER  IS  MADE  OUT  OF  RAGS 

That  shall  be  revered  and  honoured  and  its  precepts  shall  be  listened 
to  with  reverence  and  love,  which  was  at  first  despised  and  mangled 
and  tortured  with  many  different  blows. 

1MS.,  si  mostra  a  esso  cielo. 


1 104  PROPHECIES 

OF  BOOKS  WHICH  INCULCATE  PRECEPTS 

Bodies  without  souls  shall  by  their  sayings  supply  precepts  which 
shall  help  us  to  die  well. 


OF  THOSE  WHO  ARE  BEATEN  AND  SCOURGED 

Men  will  hide  themselves  within  the  bark  of  hollow  trees,  and  there 
crying  aloud  they  will  make  martyrs  of  themselves  by  beating  their 
own  limbs. 

OF  WANTONNESS 

And  they  will  go  wild  after  the  things  that  are  most  beautiful  to 
seek  after,  to  possess  and  make  use  of  their  vilest  parts;  and  afterwards, 
having  returned  with  loss  and  penitence  to  their  understanding,  they 
will  be  filled  with  great  admiration  for  themselves. 

OF  THE  AVARICIOUS 

Many  there  will  be  who  with  the  utmost  zeal  and  solicitude  will 
pursue  furiously  that  which  has  always  filled  them  with  awe,  not 
knowing  its  evil  nature. 


OF  MEN  WHO  AS  THEY  GROW  OLDER  BECOME  MORE 

MISERLY,  WHEREAS,  HAVING  BUT  A  SHORT  TIME  TO 

STAY,  THEY  OUGHT  TO  BE  MORE  GENEROUS 

You  will  see  that  those  who  are  considered  to  be  of  most  experience 
and  judgment,  in  proportion  as  they  come  to  have  less  need  of  things, 
seek  and  hoard  them  with  more  eagerness. 


OF  A  DITCH  (GIVE  THIS  AS  AN  INSTANCE  OF  FRENZY 
OR  CRAZINESS  OR  MADNESS  OF  THE  BRAIN) 

There  will  be  many  busied  in  the  practice  of  taking  from  that  thing 
which  increases  the  more  the  more  they  take  from  it. 


PROPHECIES  1 105 

OF  WEIGHT  PLACED  ON  A  FEATHER-PILLOW 

And  with  many  bodies  it  will  be  seen  that  as  you  raise  your  head 
from  them  they  will  increase  perceptibly,  and  when  the  head  that  has 
been  lifted  up  returns,  their  size  will  immediately  diminish. 


OF  CATCHING  LICE 

There  will  be  many  hunters  of  animals  who  the  more  they  catch 
the  fewer  they  will  have;  and  so  conversely  they  will  have  more  in 
proportion  as  they  catch  less. 


OF  DRAWING  WATER  WITH  TWO  BUCKETS  BY  A 
SINGLE  ROPE 

And  many  will  be  busying  themselves  with  a  thing  which  the  more 
they  draw  it  up  will  tend  the  more  to  escape  in  the  contrary  direction. 

OF  SIEVES  MADE  OF  THE  SKIN  OF  ANIMALS 

We  shall  see  the  food  of  animals  pass  through  their  skins  in  every 
way  except  through  the  mouth,  and  penetrate  through  the  opposite 
side  until  it  reaches  the  level  ground. 

OF  THE  LIGHTS  THAT  ARE  CARRIED  BEFORE  THE 

DEAD 


They  will  make  light  for  the  dead. 


OF  THE  LANTERN 

The  fierce  horns  of  powerful  bulls  will  protect  the  light  used  at 
night  from  the  impetuous  fury  of  the  winds. 


OF  FEATHERS  IN  BEDS 
Flying  creatures  will  support  men  with  their  feathers. 


no6  PROPHECIES 

OF  MEN  WHO  PASS  ABOVE  THE  TREES  WEARING 
WOODEN  STILTS 

The  swamps  will  be  so  great  that  the  men  will  go  above  the  trees 
of  their  countries. 

OF  THE  SOLES  OF  SHOES  WHICH  ARE  OF  LEATHER 

Over  a  great  part  of  the  country  men  shall  be  seen  walking  about 
on  the  skins  of  large  animals. 

OF  SAILING 

There  will  be  great  winds  through  which  the  eastern  things  will 
become  western,  and  those  of  the  south  mingled  together  in  great 
measure  by  the  course  of  the  winds  will  follow  these  through  distant 
lands. 

OF  THE  WORSHIPPING  OF  PICTURES  OF  SAINTS 

Men  shall  speak  with  men  who  shall  not  hear  them;  their  eyes  shall 
be  open  and  they  shall  not  see;  they  will  speak  to  them  and  there  shall 
be  no  reply;  they  will  ask  pardon  from  one  who  has  ears  and  does  not 
hear;  they  will  oflfer  light  to  one  who  is  blind,  and  to  the  deaf  they 
will  appeal  with  loud  clamour.1 

OF  DREAMING 

Men  shall  walk  without  moving,  they  shall  speak  with  those  who  are 
absent,  they  shall  hear  those  who  do  not  speak. 

OF  THE  SHADOW  THAT  MOVES  WITH  MAN 

There  shall  be  seen  shapes  and  figures  of  men  and  animals  which 
shall  pursue  these  men  and  animals  wheresoever  they  flee;  and  the 
movements  of  the  one  shall  be  as  those  of  the  other,  but  it  shall  seem 
a  thing  to  wonder  at  because  of  the  different  dimensions  which  the) 
assume.

REFLECTION  IN  THE  WATER  SEEN  AT  ONE  AND 

THE  SAME  TIME 

Many  times  one  man  shall  be  seen  to  change  into  three  and  all  shali 
proceed  together,  and  often  the  one  that  is  most  real  abandons  him. 

OF  WOODEN  COFFERS  WHICH  ENCLOSE  MANY 
TREASURES 

Within  walnuts  and  other  trees  and  plants  there  shall  be  found  very 
great  treasures  which  lie  hidden  there. 

OF  EXTINGUISHING  THE  LIGHT  WHEN  ONE  GOES 

TO  BED 

Many  by  forcing  their  breath  out  too  rapidly  will  lose  the  power  of 
sight,  and  in  a  short  time  all  power  of  sensation. 

OF  THE  BELLS  OF  MULES  WHICH  ARE  CLOSE  TO 
THEIR  EARS 

There  shall  be  heard  in  many  parts  of  Europe  instruments  of  various 
sizes  making  divers  melodies,  causing  great  weariness  to  those  who 
hear  them  most  closely. 

OF  ASSES 

The  many  labours  shall  be  repaid  by  hunger,  thirst,  wretchedness, 
blows  and  goadings. 

OF  SOLDIERS  ON  HORSEBACK 

Many  shall  be  seen  carried  by  large  animals  with  great  speed,  to  the 
loss  of  their  lives  and  to  instant  death.  In  the  air  and  on  the  earth  shall 
be  seen  animals  of  different  colours,  bearing  men  furiously  to  the 
destruction  of  their  lives. 

OF  STARS  ON  SPURS 

By  reason  of  the  stars  you  will  see  men  moving  as  swiftly  as  any 
swift  animal. 


no8  PROPHECIES

The  movement  of  the  dead  shall  cause  many  who  are  living  to  flee 
away  with  grief  and  lamentation  and  cries.

With  stone  and  iron  things  will  be  rendered  visible  which  were  not 
previous  seen. 

OF  OXEN  WHICH  ARE  EATEN 

The  masters  of  the  estates  will  eat  their  own  labourers. 

OF  BEATING  THE  BED  TO  REMAKE  IT 

To  such  a  pitch  of  ingratitude  shall  men  come  that  that  which  shall 
give  them  lodging  without  any  price  shall  be  loaded  with  blows,  in 
such  a  way  that  great  parts  of  the  inside  of  it  shall  be  detached  from 
their  place,  and  shall  be  turned  over  and  over  within  it. 

OF  THINGS  WHICH  ARE  EATEN  WHICH  ARE  FIRST 
PUT  TO  DEATH 

Those  who  nourish  them  will  be  slain  by  them  and  scourged  by 
barbarous  death.

trenches. 

OF  THE  WATER  WHICH  FLOWS  IN  A  TURBID  STREAM

MINGLING  WITH  THE  AIR,  AND  OF  THE  FIRE 

WHICH  MINGLES  ITS  HEAT  WITH  EACH 

All  the  elements  shall  be  seen  confounded  together,  surging  in  huge 
rolling  mass,  now  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth,  now  towards  the 


PROPHECIES  1109 

sky,  at  one  time  coursing  in  fury  from  the  southern  regions  towards 
the  icy  north,  at  another  time  from  the  east  to  the  west,  and  so  again 
from  this  hemisphere  to  the  other. 


AT  ANY  POINT  ONE  MAY  MAKE  THE  DIVISION  OF 
THE  TWO  HEMISPHERES 

All  men  will  suddenly  change  their  hemisphere. 

EVERY  POINT  FORMS  A  DIVISION  BETWEEN  THE 
EAST  AND  THE  WEST 

All  the  animals  will  move  from  the  east  to  the  west,  and  so  also 
from  the  north  to  the  south.

LOGS  THAT  ARE  DEAD

innumerable  generations  of  the  dead,  plundering  the  possessions  of  the 
living  inhabitants.

io  PROPHECIES 


OF  THE  HAFTS  OF  KNIVES  MADE  OF  RAMS'  HORNS 

In  the  horns  of  animals  shall  be  seen  sharp  irons,  which  shall  take 
away  the  lives  of  many  of  their  species. 


OF  THE  NIGHT  WHEN  ONE  CANNOT  DISTINGUISH 
ANY  COLOUR 

It  shall  even  come  to  pass  that  it  will  be  impossible  to  tell  the  differ- 
ence between  colours,  for  all  will  become  black  in  hue. 


OF  SWORDS  AND  SPEARS  WHICH  OF  THEMSELVES 
NEVER  DO  ANY  HARM  TO  ANYONE 

That  which  of  itself  is  gentle  and  void  of  all  oflence  will  become 
terrible  and  ferocious  by  reason  of  evil  companionship,  and  will  take 
the  lives  of  many  people  with  the  utmost  cruelty;  and  it  would  slay 
many  more  if  it  were  not  that  these  are  protected  by  bodies  which  are 
themselves  without  life,  which  have  come  forth  out  of  pits — that  is  by 
cuirasses  of  iron. 

OF  GINS  AND  SNARES 

Many  dead  will  move  with  fury,  and  will  take  and  bind  the  living, 
and  will  set  them  before  their  enemies  in  order  to  compass  their  death 
and  destruction. 

OF  THE  PRECIOUS  METALS 

There  shall  come  forth  out  of  dark  and  gloomy  caves  that  which 
shall  cause  the  whole  human  race  to  undergo  great  afflictions,  perils, 
and  death.  To  many  of  those  who  follow  it,  after  much  tribulation  it 
will  yield  delight;  but  whosoever  pays  it  no  homage  will  die  in  want 
and  misery.  It  shall  bring  to  pass  an  endless  number  of  crimes;  it  shall 
prompt  and  incite  wretched  men  to  assassinate,  to  steal,  and  to  enslave; 
it  shall  hold  its  own  followers  in  suspicion;  it  shall  deprive  free  cities 
of  their  rank:  it  shall  take  away  life  itself  from  many;  it  shall  make 
men  torment  each  other  with  many  kinds  of  subterfuge,  deceits,  and 
treacheries. 


PROPHECIES  mi 

O  vile  monster!  How  much  better  were  it  for  men  that  thou  shoultlst 
go  hack  to  hell!  For  this  the  vast  forests  shall  be  stripped  of  their  trees; 
for  this  an  infinite  number  of  creatures  shall  lose  their  lives. 

OF  FIRE 

From  small  beginnings  shall  arise  that  which  shall  rapidly  become 
great;  and  it  shall  have  respect  for  no  created  thing,  but  its  power  shall 
be  such  as  to  enable  it  to  transform  almost  everything  from  its  natural 
condition. 

OF  SHIPS  THAT  FOUNDER 

There  shall  be  seen  huge  bodies  devoid  of  life,  carrying  great  num- 
bers of  men  with  fierce  speed  to  the  destruction  of  their  lives.

ANOTHER

BY  AN  INFINITE  NUMBER  OF  LINES,  IN  SUCH  A  WAY 

THAT  EVERY  MAN  HAS  ALWAYS  ONE  OF 

THESE  LINES  BETWEEN  HIS  FEET

other's  language. 

OF  PRIESTS  WHO  SAY  MASS 

Many  shall  there  be  who  in  order  to  practise  their  calling  shall  put 
on  the  richest  vestments,  and  these  shall  seem  to  be  made  after  the 
manner  of  aprons. 

OF  FRIARS  WHO  HOLD  CONFESSION 

The  unhappy  women  of  their  own  accord  shall  go  to  reveal  to  men 
?11  their  wantonness  and  their  shameful  and  most  secret  acts. 


iii2  PROPHECIES 

OF  THE  CHURCHES  AND  HABITATIONS  OF  FRIARS 
There  will  be  many  who  will  abandon  work  and  labour  and  poverty 
of  life  and  possessions,  and  will  go  to  dwell  among  riches  and  in 
splendid  buildings,  pretending  that  this  is  a  means  of  becoming  accept- 
able to  God. 

OF  THE  SELLING  OF  PARADISE 

A  countless  multitude  will  sell  publicly  and  without  hindrance 
things  of  the  very  greatest  value,  without  licence  from  the  Lord  of 
these  things,  which  were  never  theirs  nor  in  their  power;  and  human 
justice  will  take  no  account  of  this. 

OF  THE  DEAD  WHO  ARE  TAKEN  TO  BE  BURIED 

The  simple  folk  will  carry  a  great  number  of  lights  to  light  up  the 
journeys  of  all  those  who  have  wholly  lost  the  power  of  sight.  O 
human  folly!  O  madness  of  mankind!  These  two  phrases  stand  for 
the  commencement  of  the  matter. 

OF  THE  DOWRIES  OF  MAIDENS 

And  whereas  at  first  young  maidens  could  not  be  protected  from  the 
lust  and  violence  of  men,  either  by  the  watchfulness  of  parents  or  by 
the  strength  of  walls,  there  will  come  a  time  when  it  will  be  necessary 
for  the  fathers  and  relatives  of  these  maidens  to  pay  a  great  price  to 
whoever  is  willing  to  marry  them,  even  although  they  may  be  rich  and 
noble  and  exceedingly  beautiful.  Herein  it  seems  certain  that  Nature 
desires  to  exterminate  the  human  race,  as  a  thing  useless  to  the  world 
and  the  destroyer  of  all  created  things. 

OF  THE  CRUELTY  OF  MAN 

Creatures  shall  be  seen  upon  the  earth  who  will  always  be  fighting 
one  with  another,  with  very  great  losses  and  frequent  deaths  on  either 
side.  These  shall  set  no  bounds  to  their  malice;  by  their  fierce  limbs  a 
great  number  of  the  trees  in  the  immense  forests  of  the  world  shall  be 
laid  level  with  the  ground;  and  when  they  have  crammed  themselves 


PROPHECIES  iiij 

with  food  it  shall  gratify  their  desire  to  deal  out  death,  affliction, 

labours,  terrors  and  banishment  to  every  living  thing.  And  by  reason 
of  their  boundless  pride  they  shall  wish  to  rise  towards  heaven,  but  the 
excessive  weight  of  their  limbs  shall  hold  them  down.  There  shall  be 
nothing  remaining  on  the  earth  or  under  the  earth  or  in  the  waters 
that  shall  not  be  pursued  and  molested  or  destroyed,  and  that  which 
is  in  one  country  taken  away  to  another;  and  their  own  bodies  shall 
be  made  the  tomb  and  the  means  of  transit  of  all  the  living  bodies 
which  they  have  slain.  O  Earth!  what  delays  thee  to  open  and  hurl 
them  headlong  into  the  deep  fissures  of  thy  huge  abysses  and  caverns, 
and  no  longer  to  display  in  the  sight  of  heaven  so  savage  and  ruthless 
a  monster? 

OF  SAILING  IN  SHIPS 

The  trees  of  the  vast  forests  of  Taurus  and  of  Sinai,  of  the  Apen- 
nines and  of  Atlas,  shall  be  seen  speeding  by  means  of  the  air  from 
east  to  west,  and  from  north  to  south,  and  transporting  by  means  of 
the  air  a  great  quantity  of  men.  Oh,  how  many  vows!  How  many 
deaths!  What  partings  between  friends  and  relatives  shall  there  be! 
How  many  who  shall  nevermore  behold  their  own  lands  or  their 
native  country,  and  shall  die  unsepulchred  and  their  bones  be  scattered 
in  divers  parts  of  the  world! 

OF  REMOVING  ON  ALL  SAINTS'  DAY 

Many  shall  leave  their  own  dwellings,  and  shall  carry  with  them  all 
their  goods  and  go  to  dwell  in  other  lands. 

OF  ALL  SOULS'  DAY 

How  many  will  there  be  who  will  mourn  for  their  dead  ancestors, 
carrying  lights  for  them!

GREAT  RICHES  AND  BESTOW  PARADISE

The  water  fallen  from  the  clouds  will  so  change  its  nature  as  to

Personalia 

'0  Leonardo,  why  do  you  toil  so  much?' 

To  write  thus  clearly  of  the  kite  would  seem  to  be  my  destiny,  because 
in  the  earliest  recollections  of  my  infancy  it  seemed  to  me  when  I  was 
in  the  cradle  that  a  kite  came  and  opened  my  mouth  with  its  tail,  and 
struck  me  within  upon  the  lips  with  its  tail  many  times,     c.a.  66  v.  b 

Pray  hold  me  not  in  scorn!  I  am  not  poor! 

Poor  rather  is  the  man  who  desires  many  things. 

Where  shall  I  take  my  place?  Where  in  a  little  time  from  henceforth 
you  shall  know.  Do  you  answer  for  yourself!  From  henceforth  in  a

If  it  is  said  that  the  King  lacks  seventy-two  ducats  of  revenue  when 
this  water  is  drawn  ofif  from  San  Cristoforo.  .  .  . 

This  His  Majesty  knows:  what  he  gives  me  he  takes  from  himself. 

But  in  this  instance  nothing  will  be  taken  from  the  King,  but  it  will 
be  taken  away  from  him  who  has  stolen  it,  because  of  the  regulation  of 
the  exits  which  the  thieves  of  the  water  have  enlarged. 

If  it  should  be  said  that  this  causes  loss  to  many,  it  amounts  to 
nothing  more  than  taking  away  from  the  thieves  what  they  have  to 
restore. 

And  indeed  the  magistrate  continually  takes  this  away  again  without 
any  thought  of  me,  and  it  exceeds  five  hundred  ounces  of  water, 
whereas  for  me  it  is  fixed  only  at  twelve  ounces.

1  This  interpretation  is  due  to  Gerolamo  Calvi,  who  considers  the  note  to  have  been 
written  in  the  last  years  of  Leonardo's  life,  either  when  on  the  point  of  departing  from 
Rome  or  in  France.  His  patron  Giuliano  de'Medici  had  died  and  the  Medici  Pope, 
Leo  X,  had  failed  to  give  him  any  employment  commensurate  with  his  powers.  He  thus 
sets  in  terse  antithesis  this  destruction  of  his  hopes  and  the  fact  that  Lorenzo  il  Mag- 
nifko  was  his  first  patron.  The  latter  statement  is  confirmed  by  the  testimony  of  the 
Anonimo  Gaddiano: — ' stette  da  giovane  col  Magnifico  Lorenzo  de'Medici,  et  dandolj 
provisione  per  se  il  jaceva  lav  or  are  nel  giardino  sidla  piaza  di  san  Marcho  dj  Firenze, 
et  haveva  30  annj,  che  dal  detto  Magnifico  Lorenzo  fn  mandato  al  duca  di  Milano.' 

The  sentence  has  also  been  held  to  refer  to  the  medical  profession  to  whom  on  occa- 
sion he  alludes  with  marked  asperity.  In  MS.  F  96  v.  he  characterises  them  as  'destroyers 
of  life'.  In  Arundel  MS.  147  v.  he  speaks  of  men  being  chosen  to  be  doctors  for  dis- 
eases about  which  they  do  not  know. 

2  On  the  same  page  of  MS.  occurs  the  line 

Laus  Deo  1500  a  di  [.  .  .]   marzo. 
The  juxtaposition  does  not  however  warrant  any  supposition  as  to  a  visit  to  Rome  of 
about  this  date.

[Dated  Note.   Thefts  of  pupil.  Pageant  ararnged  by  Leonardo] 

On  the  twenty-third  day  of  April  1490  I  commenced  this  book  and 
recommenced  the  horse. 

Giacomo  came  to  live  with  me  on  St.  Mary  Magdalene's  Day,1  1490, 
when  ten  years  of  age.  Thievish,  lying,  obstinate,  greedy. 

The  second  day  I  had  two  shirts  cut  out  for  him,  a  pair  of  hose  and 
a  doublet,  and  when  I  put  money  aside  to  pay  for  these  things  he  stole 
the  money  from  the  wallet,  and  it  was  never  possible  to  make  him 
confess,  although  I  was  absolutely  convinced.  4  lire. 

On  the  following  day  I  went  to  supper  with  Giacomo  Andrea,  and 
the  other  Giacomo  had  supper  for  two  and  did  mischief  for  four,  for 
he  broke  three  flagons,  spilt  the  wine,  and  after  this  came  to  supper 
where  I  .  .  . 

Item,  on  the  seventh  day  of  September  he  stole  a  style  worth  twenty- 
two  soldi  from  Marco  who  was  with  me.  It  was  of  silver,  and  he  took 
it  from  his  studio.  After  the  said  Marco  had  searched  for  it  a  long  time 
he  found  it  hidden  in  the  box  of  the  said  Giacomo.       2  lire  1  soldo. 

Item,  on  the  twenty-sixth  day  of  the  following  January  when  I  was 
in  the  house  of  Messer  Galeazzo  da  Sanseverino  in  order  to  arrange  the 
pageant  at  his  tournament,  and  certain  of  the  pages  had  taken  off  their 
clothes  in  order  to  try  on  some  of  the  costumes  of  the  savages  who  were 
to  appear  in  this  pageant,  Giacomo  went  to  the  wallet  of  one  of  them 
as  it  lay  on  the  bed  with  the  other  effects,  and  took  some  money  that 
he  found  there.  2  lire  4  soldi. 

Item,  a  Turkish  hide  had  been  given  me  in  the  same  house  by  the 
Master  Agostino  of  Pavia  in  order  to  make  a  pair  of  boots,  and  this 
Giacomo  stole  it  from  me  within  a  month  and  sold  it  to  a  cobbler  for 
twenty  soldi,  and  with  the  money  as  he  has  himself  confessed  to  me 
he  bought  aniseed  comfits.  2  lire. 

Item,  further  on  the  second  day  of  April  Giovanni  Antonio  chanced 
to  leave  a  silver  style  upon  one  of  his  drawings,  and  this  Giacomo  stole 
it  from  him,  and  it  was  worth  twenty-four  soldi.  1  lira  4  soldi. 

The  first  year:  a  cloak  2  lire,  6  shirts  4  lire,  3  doublets  6  lire,  4  pairs

PERSONALIA  1127 

When  I  was  at  sea  in  a  position  equally  distant  from  a  level  shore 
and  a  mountain,  the  side  on  which  the  shore  was,  seemed  much  farther 
ofi  than  that  of  the  mountain.'  l  77  v. 

Like  a  eddying  wind  scouring  through  a  hollow,  sandy  valley,  and 
with  speeding  course  driving  into  its  vortex  everything  that  opposes  its 
furious  onset  .  .  . 

Not  otherwise  does  the  northern  blast  drive  back  with  its  hurri- 
cane .  .  . 

Nor  does  the  tempestuous  sea  make  so  loud  a  roaring  when  the 
northern  blast  beats  it  back  in  foaming  waves  between  Scylla  and 
Charybdis,  nor  Stromboli  nor  Mount  Etna  when  the  pent  up,  sulphur- 
ous fires,  bursting  open  and  rending  asunder  the  mighty  mountain  by 
their  force,  are  hurling  through  the  air  rocks  and  earth  mingled  together 
m  the  issuing  belching  flames.  .  .  . 

Nor  when  Etna's  burning  caverns  vomit  forth  and  give  out  again  the 
uncontrollable  element,  and  thrust  it  back  to  its  own  region  in  fury, 
driving  before  it  whatever  obstacle  withstands  its  impetuous  rage.  .  .  . 

And  drawn  on  by  my  eager  desire,  anxious  to  behold  the  great 
abundance  of  the  varied  and  strange  forms  created  by  the  artificer 
Nature,  having  wandered  for  some  distance  among  the  overhanging 
rocks,  I  came  to  the  mouth  of  a  huge  cavern  before  which  for  a  time 
I  remained  stupefied,  not  having  been  aware  of  its  existence,  my  back 
bent  to  an  arch,  my  left  hand  clutching  my  knee,  while  with  the  right 
I  made  a  shade  for  my  lowered  and  contracted  eyebrows;  and  I  was 
bending  continually  first  one  way  and  then  another  in  order  to  see 
whether  I  could  discern  anything  inside,  though  this  was  rendered 
impossible  by  the  intense  darkness  within.  And  after  remaining  there 
for  a  time,  suddenly  there  were  awakened  within  me  two  emotions,  fear 

1  In  the  sketch  that  accompanies  this  note  a  vessel  is  seen  proceeding  from  a  moun- 
tainous shore  to  one  more  low-lying.  The  note  is  designated  by  M.  Ravaisson-Mollien 
'an  optical  delusion'.  Its  major  interest  is  in  the  biographical  question  it  raises.  That 
Leonardo  was  himself  once  at  sea  in  a  position  equally  distant  between  a  level  and  a 
mountainous  shore,  both  visible  at  once,  is  here  clearly  stated.  In  discussing  the  interpre- 
tation of  the  Armenian  letters  in  the  Codice  Atlantico  (The  Mind  of  L.  da  V.,  p.  232, 
etc.)  I  have  shown  that  the  experience  is  such  as  would  befall  a  traveller  journeying 
from  Khelindreh,  the  medieval  port  of  Armenia,  mentioned  in  Leonardo's  text  as 
Calindra,  to  Cyprus,  which  is  referred  to  in  a  passage  in  the  Windsor  Manuscripts, 
'setting  out  from  the  coast  of  Cilicia  towards  the  south  you  discover  the  beauty  of  the 
island  of  Cyprus'

O  powerful  and  once  living  instrument  of  constructive  Nature,  thv 
great  strength  not  availing  thee,  thou  must  needs  abandon  thy  tranquil 
life  to  obey  the  law  which  God  and  time  ordained  for  all-procreative 
Nature!  To  thee  availed  not  the  branching,  sturdy  dorsal  fins  where- 
with pursuing  thy  prey  thou  wast  wont  to  plough  thy  way,  tempestu- 
ously tearing  open  the  briny  waves  with  thy  breast. 

O  how  many  times  the  frightened  shoals  of  dolphins  and  big  tunny- 
fish  were  seen  to  flee  before  thy  insensate  fury;  and  thou,  lashing  with 
swift,  branching  fins  and  forked  tail,  didst  create  in  the  sea  sudden 
tempest  with  loud  uproar  and  foundering  of  ships;  with  mighty  wave 
thou  didst  heap  up  the  open  shores  with  the  frightened  and  terrified 
fishes,  which  thus  escaping  from  thee  were  left  high  and  dry  when  the 
sea  abandoned  them,  and  became  the  plenteous  and  abundant  spoil  of 
the  neighbouring  peoples. 


O  Time,  swift  despoiler  of  created  things!  How  many  kings,  how 
many  peoples  hast  thou  brought  low!  How  many  changes  of  state  and 
circumstance  have  followed  since  the  wondrous  form  of  this  fish  died 
here  in  this  hollow  winding  recess  ?  Now,  destroyed  by  Time,  patiently 
it  lies  within  this  narrow  space,  and,  with  its  bones  despoiled  and  bare, 
it  is  become  an  armour  and  support  to  the  mountain  which  lies  above  it.

.stationary,  and  it  retained  the  light  of  the  sun  on  its  apex  for  an  houi 
and  a  half  after  sunset,  so  enormous  was  its  size.  Leic.  28  r.

Dearest  father, 

On  the  last  of  the  past  month  I  had  the  letter  you  wrote  to  me  which 
in  a  brief  space  caused  me  pleasure  and  also  sorrow.  I  was  pleased  at 
learning  from  it  that  you  were  in  good  health,  for  which  God  be 
praised.  I  was  filled  with  sorrow  at  hearing  of  your  discomfort.

Description  of  Mount  Taurus  and  of  the  river  Euphrates.  To  the 
Devatdar  of  Syria,  lieutenant  of  the  sacred  Sultan  of  Babylon: 

The  recent  unforeseen  event  which  has  occurred  in  these  our  northern 
parts  which  I  am  certain  will  strike  terror  not  only  into  you  but  into 
the  whole  world  shall  be  revealed  to  you  in  its  due  order,  showing  first 
the  effect  and  then  the  cause. 

Finding  myself  in  this  part  of  Armenia  in  order  to  discharge  with 
devotion  and  care  the  duties  of  that  office  to  which  you  have  appointed 
me,  and  making  a  beginning  in  those  parts  which  seem  to  me  to  be 
most  suitable  for  our  purpose,  I  entered  into  the  city  of  Calindra  which 
is  near  to  our  borders.  This  city  is  situated  on  the  sea-coast  of  that  part 
of  the  Taurus  range  which  is  separated  from  the  Euphrates  and  looks 
westward  to  the  peaks  of  the  great  Mount  Taurus.  These  peaks  are  of 
such  a  height  that  they  seem  to  touch  the  sky,  for  in  the  whole  world 
there  is  no  part  of  the  earth  that  is  higher  than  their  summit,  and  they 
are  always  struck  by  the  rays  of  the  sun  in  the  east  four  hours  before 
day.  And  being  of  exceedingly  white  stone  this  shines  brightly  and 
performs  the  same  office  for  the  Armenians  of  these  parts  as  the 
beautiful  light  of  the  moon  would  in  the  midst  of  the  darkness;  and 
by  reason  of  its  great  height  it  outstretches  the  highest  level  of  the 
clouds  for  a  space  of  four  miles  in  a  straight  line. 

This  peak  is  visible  from  a  great  part  of  the  west  illuminated  by  the 
sun  after  its  setting  during  the  third  part  of  the  night.  And  it  is  this 
which  among  you  in  calm  weather  has  formerly  been  thought  to  be  a 


EI54  LETTERS 

comet,  and  seems  to  us  in  the  darkness  of  the  night  to  assume  various 
shapes,  sometimes  dividing  into  two  or  three  parts,  sometimes  long  and 
sometimes  short.  And  this  proceeds  from  the  fact  that  the  clouds  on  the 
horizon  come  between  part  of  this  mountain  and  the  sun,  and  by  their 
cutting  these  solar  rays  the  light  of  the  mountain  is  broken  by  various 
spaces  of  clouds  and  therefore  its  brightness  is  variable  in  shape. 

Why  the  mountain  shines  at  its  summit  half  or  a  third  of  the  night, 
and  seems  a  comet  after  sunset  to  those  who  dwell  in  the  west,  and 
before  sunrise  to  those  who  dwell  in  the  east. 

Why  this  comet  seems  variable  in  shape,  so  that  at  one  time  it  is 
round,  at  another  long,  at  another  divided  into  two  or  three  parts,  at 
another  united,  and  sometimes  invisible  and  sometimes  becoming 
visible  again.  ca.  145  v.  a 

OF  THE  SHAPE  OF  MOUNT  TAURUS 

I  am  not  justly  to  be  accused  of  idleness,  O  Devatdar,  as  your  stric- 
tures seem  to  intimate,  but  your  unbounded  affection  which  has  caused 
you  to  confer  these  benefits  upon  me  has  constrained  me  to  employ  the 
utmost  care  in  seeking  out  and  diligently  investigating  the  cause  of  so 
momentous  and  so  startling  an  occurrence,  and  for  this  time  was 
necessary. 

In  order  now  to  make  you  well  acquainted  with  the  cause  of  so  great 
an  effect  it  is  necessary  that  I  shall  describe  the  nature  of  the  place,  and 
then  I  will  proceed  to  the  event,  by  which  process  I  believe  you  will  be 
fully  satisfied. 

Do  not  distress  yourself,  O  Devatdar,  at  my  delay  in  replying  to  your 
urgent  request,  because  the  matters  about  which  you  have  asked  me 
are  of  such  a  nature  as  cannot  well  be  expressed  without  lapse  of  time, 
and  especially  because  in  wishing  to  expound  the  cause  of  so  great  an 
effect  it  is  necessary  to  describe  exactly  the  nature  of  the  place,  and  you 
will  afterwards  be  able  by  means  of  this  easily  to  satisfy  yourself  as  to 
the  above-mentioned  request. 

I  will  omit  any  description  of  the  shape  of  Asia  Minor,  or  of  what 
seas  or  lands  they  are  which  determine  the  aspect  of  its  surface,  know- 
ing as  I  do  your  diligence  and  care  in  your  studies  to  be  such  that  you 
will  already  have  acquired  this   knowledge;   I   pass   on   thefefore  to

furnish  you  with  an  account  of  the  true  shape  of  Mount  Taurus  which 

has  been  the  scene  of  so  surprising  and  destructive  a  catastrophe,  for 
this  may  serve  to  advance  our  purpose. 

It  is  this  Mount  Taurus  which,  according  to  many,  is  said  to  be  the 
ridge  of  the  Caucasus,  hut,  wishing  to  be  quite  clear  about  this,  1  set 
mvself  to  interrogate  some  of  the  inhabitants  of  the  shores  of  the 
Caspian  Sea;  and  they  inform  me  that  although  their  mountains  bear 
the  same  name  these  are  of  greater  height,  and  they  confirm  this 
therefore  to  be  the  true  Mount  Caucasus,  since  Caucasus  in  the  Scythian 
tongue  means  'supreme  height'.  And  in  fact  nothing  is  known  of  the 
existence  either  in  the  east  or  the  west  of  any  mountain  of  so  great  a 
height,  and  the  proof  of  this  is  that  the  inhabitants  of  those  countries 
which  are  on  the  west  see  the  sun's  rays  illuminating  part  of  its  summit 
for  a  fourth  part  of  the  longest  night,  and  similarly  with  the  countries 
which  are  on  the  east. 


OF  THE  STRUCTURE  AND  DIMENSIONS  OF 
MOUNT  TAURUS 

The  shadow  of  this  ridge  of  the  Taurus  is  so  high  that  in  the  middle 
of  June  when  the  sun  is  at  the  meridian  it  reaches  to  the  borders  of 
Sarmatia,  which  are  twelve  days'  journey,  and  in  mid-December  it 
extends  as  far  as  the  Hyperborean  Mountains,  which  are  a  month's 
journey  to  the  north.  And  the  side  that  faces  the  way  the  wind  blows 
is  full  of  clouds  and  mists,  because  the  wind  which  is  cleft  in  twain 
as  it  strikes  against  the  rock  and  closes  up  again  beyond  it,  carries  with 
it  in  this  way  the  clouds  from  all  parts  and  leaves  them  where  it  strikes, 
and  it  is  always  full  of  thunderbolts  through  the  great  number  of  clouds 
which  are  gathered  there,  and  this  causes  the  rock  to  be  all  fissured  and 
filled  with  huge  debris. 

This  mountain  at  its  base  is  inhabited  by  a  very  opulent  people;  it 
abounds  in  most  beautiful  springs  and  rivers;  it  is  fertile  and  teems 
with  everything  that  is  good  and  especially  in  those  parts  which  have  a 
southern  aspect.  After  an  ascent  of  about  three  miles,  you  come  to 
where  begin  the  forests  of  great  firs  and  pines  and  beeches  and  other 
similar  trees;  beyond  for  a  space  of  another  three  miles  you  find  mead- 
ows and  vast  pastures,  and  all  the  rest  as  far  as  the  beginning  of  the 


1136 


LETTERS 


peak  of  Taurus  is  eternal  snow,  for  this  never  disappears  in  any  season, 
11  nd  it  extends  at  this  height  for  about  fourteen  miles  in  all.  From  the 
point  where  the  peak  begins  for  about  a  mile  the  clouds  never  pass,  so 
that  they  extend  for  about  fifteen  miles  with  a  height  of  about  five  in  a 
straight  line.  As  far  beyond  or  thereabouts  we  find  the  summit  of  the 
peaks  of  Taurus,  and  here  from  about  half  way  upwards  we  commence 
to  find  the  air  grow  warm,  and  there  is  no  breath  of  wind  to  be  felt  and 
nothing  can  live  there  very  long.  Nothing  is  brought  forth  there  except 
some  birds  of  prey,  which  nest  in  the  deep  gorges  of  the  Taurus  and 
descend  below  the  clouds  to  seek  their  prey  upon  the  grassy  hills.  It  is 
all  bare  rock  from  above  where  the  clouds  are,  and  the  rock  is  of  a 
dazzling  whiteness,  and  it  is  not  possible  to  go  to  the  lofty  summit 
because  the  ascent  is  rough  and  dangerous.  c.a.  145  v.  b 

People  were  to  be  seen  who  in  a  state  of  great  excitement  were  bring- 
ing together  all  sorts  of  provisions  upon  vessels  of  all  descriptions  hastily 
put  together  as  necessity  dictated. 

The  gleaming  of  the  waves  was  not  visible  in  the  parts  that  reflected 
the  dark  rain  and  the  clouds.  But  where  they  reflect  the  flashes  produced 
by  the  thunderbolts,  as  many  gleams  were  seen  caused  by  the  images 
of  these  flashes  as  were  the  waves  that  reflected  them  to  the  eyes  of  the 
spectators.  And  the  number  of  the  images  caused  by  the  flashes  of  the 
lightning  upon  the  waves  of  the  water  increased  in  proportion  to 
the  distance  of  the  eyes  of  the  spectators.  Similarly  also  the  number  of 
the  images  diminished  in  proportion  as  they  were  nearer  to  the  eyes 
which  saw  them;  as  is  proved  in  the  definition  of  the  radiance  of  the 
moon  and  of  our  maritime  horizon,  when  the  sun  is  reflected  there 
with  its  rays  and  the  eye  which  receives  this  reflection  is  at  a  great 
distance  from  this  sea.  c.a.  155  r.  b 

I  wished  to  keep  him  to  eat  with  me,  as  .  .  . 

He  went  to  eat  with  the  bodyguard,  and  through  this  not  only  did 
he  spend  two  or  three  hours  at  table,  but  very  frequently  the  remainder 
of  the  day  was  spent  in  going  about  with  a  gun  amid  the  ruins  killing 
birds. 

And  if  any  of  my  servants  entered  the  workshop  he  abused  them,  and 
if  anyone  reproved  him  he  said  that  he  was  working  for  the  arsenal 


LETTERS  [137 

cleaning  armour   and   guns.   As   regards   money,   right    from   the  very 
beginning  of  the  month  he  was  very  eager  to  get  hold  of  it. 

And  in  order  not  to  he  disturbed  he  left  the  workshop  and  made 
himself  one  in  his  room,  and  worked  for  others,  and  so  at  last  I  had 
to  tell  him  .  .  . 

As  I  saw  that  he  was  very  little  in  the  workshop  and  consumed  a 
good  deal,  I  sent  a  message  to  him  that  if  it  pleased  him  I  would  strike 
a  bargain  with  him  for  whatever  he  made,  and  have  it  valued,  and  I 
would  then  give  him  as  much  as  we  agreed  upon:  he  took  counsel  with 
his  neighbour  and  gave  up  his  room,  selling  everything  and  came  to 
look  for  .  .  . 

This  other  has  hindered  me  in  anatomy  before  the  Pope,  traducing 
me,  and  also  with  the  hospital;  and  he  has  filled  the  whole  of  this 
Belvedere  with  workshops  for  mirrors,  and  workmen,  and  he  has  done 
the  same  in  the  apartment  of  the  master  Giorgio. 

He  never  did  any  work  without  discussing  it  every  day  with 
Giovanni,  who  then  spread  the  news  of  it  and  proclaimed  it  everywhere, 
stating  that  he  was  a  master  of  such  art;  and  as  regards  the  part  which 
he  did  not  understand  he  announced  that  I  did  not  know  what  I  wanted 
to  do,  thus  shifting  the  blame  of  his  ignorance  upon  me. 

I  cannot  make  anything  secretly  because  of  him,  for  the  other  is 
always  at  his  elbow,  since  the  one  room  leads  into  the  other.  But  his 
whole  intent  was  to  get  possession  of  these  two  rooms  in  order  to  get  to 
work  on  the  mirrors.  And  if  I  set  him  there  to  make  my  model  of  a 
curved  one  he  would  publish  it. 

He  said  that  he  had  been  promised  eight  ducats  per  month,  to 
commence  from  the  first  day  that  he  set  out,  or  at  latest  from  when  he 
had  his  interview  with  you,  and  that  you  agreed  to  this.  c.a.  182  v.  c 

My  most  beloved  brother,1 

This  is  sent  merely  to  inform  you  that  a  short  time  ago  I  received  a 
letter  from  you  from  which  I  learnt  that  you  have  had  an  heir,  which 
circumstance  I  understand  has  afforded  you  a  great  deal  of  pleasure. 
Now  in  so  far  as  I  had  judged  you  to  be  possessed  of  prudence  I  am 
now  entirely  convinced  that  I  am  as  far  removed  from  having  an 
accurate  judgment  as  you  are  from  prudence;  seeing  that  you  have  been

congratulating  yourself  in  having  created  a  watchful  enemy,  who  will 
strive  with  all  his  energies  after  liberty,  which  can  only  come  into 
being  at  your  death.  c.a.  202  v.  a 

You  wished  the  utmost  evil  to  Francesco  and  have  let  him  enjoy  your 
property  in  your  life;  to  me  you  do  not  wish  great  evil  .  .  . 

To  whom  have  you  wished  better?  To  Francesco  or  to  me?  To  you 
he  wishes  it,  and  he  gives  mine  after  me  so  that  I  cannot  act  according 
to  my  wish,  and  he  knows  that  I  cannot  alienate  my  heir.  He  wishes 
then  to  demand  from  my  heirs  and  not  as  F.,  but  as  one  entirely  alien, 
and  I  as  one  entirely  alien  will  receive  him  and  his. 

Have  you  given  such  money  to  Leonardo?  No.  Oh  what  excuse 
whether  feigned  or  true  will  you  be  able  to  give  for  having  drawn  him 
into  this  trap,  except  to  take  him  and  his  money.  And  I  will  not  say 
anything  to  him  as  long  as  he  lives.  You  do  not  wish  therefore  to  repay 
the  money  lent  on  your  account  to  his  heirs;  but  you  wish  that  he 
should  pay  over  the  revenues  that  he  has  from  this  possession. 

Oh  why  do  you  not  allow  him  to  enjoy  them  during  his  life,  since 
afterwards  they  would  return  to  your  children,  and  he  cannot  live 
many  years? 

If  then  you  take  into  account  that  I  may  do  that,  you  will  wish  that 
I  was  the  heir,  because  I  should  not  be  able  as  heir  to  demand  from 
you  the  moneys  which  I  had  had  from  Francesco.  c.a.  214  v.  a 

As  I  have  in  my  letters  rejoiced  with  you  many  times  over  your 
prosperous  fortunes  so  I  know  now  that  you  as  a  friend  will  share  my 
sorrow  at  the  miserable  condition  to  which  I  am  reduced;  for  the  fact 
is  that  in  these  last  days  I  have  had  so  many  anxieties,  so  many  fears, 
dangers  and  losses,  as  have  also  the  wretched  country-folk,  that  we  have 
come  to  envy  the  dead. 

And  certainly  I  for  my  part  cannot  imagine  that  since  first  the 
elements  by  their  separation  made  order  out  of  chaos,  they  can  ever 
have  united  their  force  or  rather  their  frenzy  to  work  such  destruction 
to  mankind,  as  has  now  been  seen  and  experienced  by  us;  so  that  I 
cannot  imagine  what  could  further  increase  so  great  a  misfortune  as 
this  that  we  have  experienced  in  a  space  of  ten  hours.  First  we  were 
assailed  and  bufTeted  by  the  might  and  fury  of  the  winds,  and  then 
followed  the  avalanches  from  the  great  snow-covered  mountains  which 


LETTERS  1 139 

have  choked  up  all  these  valleys,  and  caused  a  great  pan  of  this  city  to 
tall  in  ruins.  And,  not  content  with  this,  the  tempest  has  submerged 
with  a  sudden  deluge  of  water  all  the  lower  parts  oi  the  city;  and 
beyond  all  this  there  was  added  a  sudden  storm  of  rain  and  a  furious 
hurricane,  laden  with  water,  sand,  mud,  and  stones  all  mingled  together 
with  roots,  branches,  and  stumps  of  various  trees;  and  every  kind  of 
thing  came  hurtling  through  the  air  and  descended  upon  us,  and  finally 
a  great  fire — which  did  not  seem  to  be  borne  by  the  wind  but  as  though 
carried  by  thirty  thousand  devils — has  burnt  up  and  destroyed  all  this 
country  and  has  not  yet  ceased.  And  the  few  of  us  who  remain  are  left 
in  such  a  state  of  dismay  and  fear  that,  like  those  who  are  half-witted, 
we  scarce  dare  to  hold  speech  one  with  another,  but  giving  up  even  the 
attempt  at  work  we  stay  huddled  together  in  the  ruins  of  some  of  the 
churches,  men  and  women  small  and  great  all  mingled  together  like 
herds  of  goats;  and  but  for  certain  people  having  helped  us  with 
provisions  we  should  all  have  died  of  hunger.  Now  you  can  understand 
the  state  we  are  in;  and  yet  all  these  evils  are  as  nothing  by  comparison 
with  those  which  threaten  us  within  a  brief  space  of  time. 

I  know  that  you  as  a  friend  will  have  a  fellow-feeling  for  my  mis- 
fortunes, even  as  I  in  my  former  letters  have  shown  myself  glad  at  your 
prosperity.1  c.a.  214  v.  d

My  most  illustrious  Lords, 

As  I  have  perceived  that  the  Turks  cannot  invade  Italy  by  any  part 
of  the  mainland  without  crossing  the  river  Isonzo  .  .  .  and  although 
I  know7  that  it  is  not  possible  to  devise  any  means  of  protection  which 
shall  endure  for  any  length  of  time,  I  cannot  refrain  from  bringing  to 
your  notice  the  fact  that  a  small  number  of  men  aided  by  this  river 
might  do  the  work  of  many,  seeing  that  where  these  rivers  .  .  . 

I  have  formed  the  opinion  that  it  is  not  possible  to  make  a  defence

in  any  other  position  which  would  be  of  such  universal  efficacy  as  that 
made  over  this  river. 

In  proportion  as  the  water  is  more  turbid  it  is  heavier,  and  as  it  is 
heavier  it  is  the  swifter  in  its  descent,  and  that  substance  which  is 
swifter  makes  more  impression  upon  its  object.

An  armed  force  cannot  prevail  against  these  if  it  is  not  united,  and 
if  it  is  united  it  can  only  be  in  one  particular  place,  and  being  thus 
united  in  one  particular  place  it  is  either  weaker  or  stronger  than  the 
enemy;  and  if  it  be  weaker  and  this  be  discerned  by  the  enemy  by 
means  of  its  spies  they  will  pass  by  treachery  .  .  . 

(I  having)  my  most  illustrious  lords  (examined  closely  the  river  of 
the  Isonzo)  having  the  conditions  (and  in  addition  to  this  having  been 
informed)  by  the  country-folk  (I  have  been  informed)  how  from 
whatever  side  (the  country-folk)  the  enemy  may  arrive. 

My  most  illustrious  Lords — As  I  have  carefully  examined  the  con- 
ditions of  the  river  Isonzo,  and  have  been  given  to  understand  by  the 
country-folk  that  whatever  route  on  the  mainland  the  Turks  may  take 
in  order  to  approach  this  part  of  Italy  they  must  finally  arrive  at  this 
river,  I  have  therefore  formed  the  opinion  that  even  though  it  may  not 
be  possible  to  make  such  defences  upon  this  river  as  would  not 
ultimately  be  ruined  and  destroyed  by  its  floods  .  .  . 

My  most  illustrious  Lords — As  I  have  (well  considered  the  conditions 
of  the  river)  recognised  that  by  whatever  side  of  the  mainland  the 
Turks  may  think  to  approach  our  Italian  lands  they  must  needs  finally 
arrive  at  them  by  the  river  Isonzo  .  .  . 

OF  CHANGING  THE  POSITION  OF  THE  RIVER 

Of  what  may  be  said  against  its  permanence,  and  what  the  logs 
which  are  brought  by  the  rivers  will  break. 

To  this  I  reply  that  all  the  supports  should  be  equal  in  height  with 
the  lowest  depth  of  the  banks;  so  if  the  river  should  come  to  rise  to 
this  height  it  will  not  enter  in  the  woods  near  to  the  bank,  and  not 


LETTERS  1141 

entering  there  it  will  not  be  possible  lor  it  to  carry  away  any  logs,  and 
so  the  river  will  flow  with  only  its  own  water  in  mere  turbulence. 

And  it  it  rises  above  its  bank,  as  has  been  seen  this  year  when  it  rose 
about  four  braeeia  above  the  lower  bank,  it  carries  very  great  logs  with 
it,  bearing  them  floating  along  accompanying  its  course,  and  then  leaves 
them  resting  firmly  fixed  against  the  larger  trees  which  are  of  such  a 
kind  as  to  offer  resistance,  and  they  remain  caught  in  the  branches. 

If  however  they  are  borne  along  on  the  river  it  is  because  they  have 
few  or  no  branches  and  float  on  the  surface  and  do  not  touch  the 
toothed  barrier  which  I  have  set  up. 

When  the  great  floods  come  which  carry  logs  and  very  large  trees 
they  will  pass  four  or  five  braccia  above  the  tops  of  these  defences,  and 
the  signs  of  this  are  seen  by  the  objects  left  fixed  to  the  branches  of  the 
trees  when  it  has  risen. 

When  the  water  has  no  current  it  will  easily  and  speedily  become 
choked  up  with  faggots,  for  those  which  have  fallen  into  it  will  be 
always  turning  back  .  .  . 1  c.a.  234  v.  c 

So  greatly  did  I  rejoice,  most  illustrious  Lord,  at  your  much  wished- 
for  restoration  to  health  that  I  found  my  own  malady  had  almost  left 
me  at  the  news  of  your  Excellency's  recovery.  But  I  am  extremely  sorry 
that  I  have  not  been  able  entirely  to  satisfy  your  Excellency's  desires, 
through  the  malice  of  this  rogue,  as  regards  whom  I  have  never  omitted 
to  do  anything  which  I  possibly  could  which  might  be  of  service  to 
him.  In  the  first  place,  his  salary  was  always  paid  him  before  it  was  due, 

1 1  have  ventured  to  change  the  order  of  a  few  of  the  sentences  of  this  letter  as  they 
occur  in  the  edition  published  by  the  Accademia  dei  Lincei,  in  the  attempt  to  enhance 
the  sense  of  continuity. 

On  the  same  page  is  a  slighdy  drawn  sketch  or  plan  of  road  and  river  communica- 
tions with  the  words  ponte  di  goritia  (bridge  of  Gorizia)  and  vil  pagho  alta  alta.  The 
last  word  refers  presumably  to  the  nature  of  the  land,  the  first  is  identical  with  Wip- 
pach  (Italian  Vipacco),  the  name  of  an  eastern  tributary  of  the  Isonzo  and  also  of  a 
village  under  which  it  flows,  which  lies  on  a  spur  of  the  hills  some  twenty  kilometres 
west  of  Gorizia.  From  the  position  of  Wippach  it  would  seem  to  dominate  the  road 
across  the  mountains  from  Laibach  to  Gorizia,  which  would  be  the  probable  route  that 
would  be  taken  by  an  army  advancing  from  the  east  to  cross  the  Isonzo  at  Gorizia. 
Wippach  lies  some  four  kilometres  to  the  south  of  this  road  and  is  connected  with  it 
bv  two  roads  running  north-east  and  north-west.

which  I  believe  he  would  gladly  deny  if  it  were  not  that  I  had  the 
signature  witnessed  by  the  hand  of  the  interpreter.  And  as  I  saw  that 
he  would  not  work  for  me  unless  he  could  not  find  any  work  to  do  for 
others,  and  that  he  sought  for  this  diligently,  I  urged  him  to  have  his 
meals  with  me  and  to  work  with  his  files  near  to  me,  for  besides  this 
being  economical  and  good  for  his  work  it  would  help  him  to  acquire 
Italian;  and  so  he  always  promised  to  do  but  he  was  never  willing  to 
do  it.  He  acted  in  this  way  because  that  German  Giovanni  who  makes 
mirrors  was  every  day  in  his  workshop,  and  wanted  to  see  and  under- 
stand all  that  was  being  done  and  then  talked  about  it  everywhere, 
finding  fault  with  what  he  did  not  understand.  And  also  because  he 
went  to  dine  with  the  men  of  the  Pope's  guard,  and  then  went  out  with 
them  with  guns  to  kill  birds  in  the  ruins,  and  pursued  this  course  from 
dinner-time  until  the  evening.  And  if  I  sent  Lorenzo  to  him  to  urge  him 
to  work  he  got  in  a  rage  with  him,  and  told  him  that  he  wasn't  going 
to  have  so  many  masters  over  him,  and  that  he  was  at  work  upon  your 
Excellency's  Wardrobe.  So  two  months  passed  and  the  thing  still  went 
on,  until  one  day  happening  to  find  Gian  Niccolo  of  the  Wardrobe  I 
asked  him  whether  the  German  had  finished  his  work  for  II  Magnifico, 
and  he  told  me  that  it  was  none  of  it  true  because  he  had  only  given 
him  two  guns  to  clean.  After  this  when  I  expostulated  with  him  he  left 
the  workshop  and  began  to  work  in  his  own  room,  and  wasted  a  lot  of 
time  in  making  another  vice  and  files  and  other  instruments  with 
screws,  and  made  shuttles  there  to  twist  silk  and  gold,  which  he  hid 
whenever  any  of  my  people  went  in,  and  this  with  a  thousand  oaths 
and  revilings,  so  that  none  of  them  were  willing  to  go  there  any  more. 

So  greatly  did  I  rejoice,  most  illustrious  Lord,  at  your  much  wished- 
for  restoration  to  health  that  my  own  malady  almost  left  me.  But  I 
greatly  regret  that  I  have  been  unable  to  satisfy  the  desires  of  your 
Excellency,  entirely  through  the  malice  of  that  German  rogue,  as 
regards  whom  I  have  left  nothing  undone  which  I  thought  might  give 
him  pleasure.  And  firstly  because  I  invited  him  to  take  up  his  abode 
and  have  meals  with  me,  so  that  I  could  always  see  what  work  he  was 
doing  and  could  easily  correct  his  errors,  and  moreover  he  would 
acquire  Italian  and  so  be  able  to  speak  it  easily  without  an  interpreter, 
and  most  important  of  all  the  moneys  due  to  him  could  always  be  paid

before  the  time,  as  always  has  been.  Then  he  asked  that  he  might  have 
the  models  finished  in  wood  just  as  they  were  to  be  in  iron,  and  wished 
to  carry  them  away  to  his  own  country.  But  this  I  refused,  telling  him 
that  I  would  give  him  a  drawing  of  the  width,  length,  thickness  and 
outline  of  what  he  had  to,  and  so  we  remained  at  enmity. 

The  second  thing  was  that  in  the  room  where  he  slept  he  made 
himself  another  workshop  with  new  screw-vices  and  instruments,  and 
diere  worked  for  others.  Afterwards  he  went  to  dine  with  the  Swiss  of 
the  Guard  where  there  are  plenty  of  idlers,  but  he  beat  them  all  at  it. 
Then  he  used  to  go  out  and  more  often  than  not  two  or  three  of  them 
went  together  with  guns  to  shoot  birds  among  the  ruins,  and  this  went 
on  until  the  evening. 

Finally  I  discovered  that  it  was  this  master  Giovanni  who  made 
mirrors  who  had  brought  all  this  about  and  this  for  two  reasons;  first 
because  he  had  said  that  my  coming  here  had  deprived  him  of  the 
countenance  and  favour  of  your  Lordship  which  always  . . . ,  and  the 
other  reason  is  because  he  says  the  room  of  this  iron-worker  would  suit 
him  for  working  at  mirrors,  and  he  has  given  proof  of  this,  for  besides 
setting  him  against  me  he  has  made  him  sell  all  his  effects  and  leave  his 
workshop  to  him,  and  he  has  established  himself  there  now  with  a 
number  of  assistants  making  many  mirrors  to  send  to  the  fairs.

My  Lords,  Fathers,  Deputies, — Just  as  for  the  doctors,  the  tutors  and 
guardians  of  the  sick,  it  is  necessary  that  they  should  understand  what 
man  is,  what  life  is,  and  what  health  is,  and  how  a  parity  or  harmony 
of  elements  maintains  this,  and  in  like  manner  a  discord  of  these  ruins 
and  destroys  it;  and  anyone  who  has  acquired  a  good  knowledge  of 
these  conditions  will  be  better  able  to  effect  cures  than  one  who  is 
without  it  .  .  . 

You  know  that  medicines  when  well  used  restore  health  to  the  sick: 
they  will  be  well  used  when  the  doctor  together  with  his  understanding 
of  their  nature  shall  understand  also  what  man  is,  what  life  is,  and 
what  constitution  and  health  are.  Know  these  well  and  you  will  know 
their  opposites;  and  when  this  is  the  case  you  will  know  well  how  to 
devise  a  remedy — 


H44  LETTERS 

You  know  that  medicines  when  well  used  restore  health  to  the  sick, 
and  he  who  knows  them  well  will  use  them  well  when  he  also  knows 
what  man  is,  and  what  life  and  the  constitution  are,  and  what  health  is. 
Knowing  these  well  he  will  know  their  opposites,  and  being  thus 
equipped  he  will  be  nearer  to  devising  a  remedy  than  anyone  else.  In 
just  the  same  way  a  cathedral  in  need  of  repair  requires  a  doctor- 
architect  who  understands  well  what  a  building  is,  and  on  what  rules 
the  correct  method  of  construction  is  based,  and  from  whence  these 
rules  are  derived,  and  into  how  many  parts  they  are  divided,  and  what 
are  the  causes  which  hold  the  structure  together,  and  make  it  perma- 
nent, and  what  the  nature  of  weight  is  and  what  the  desire  of  strength, 
and  how  these  should  be  interwoven  and  bound  up  together,  and  what 
effect  their  union  produces.  Whoever  shall  have  a  true  knowledge 
about  the  above-named  things  will  satisfy  you  both  by  his  intelligence 
and  his  work. 

So  for  this  reason  I  shall  endeavour  without  disparaging  and  with- 
out defaming  anyone  to  satisfy  you  partly  by  arguments  and  partly  by 
demonstration,  sometimes  revealing  the  effects  from  the  causes,  some- 
times confirming  the  reasoning  from  experience,  fitting  with  them 
certain  of  the  principles  of  the  architects  of  old  time  and  the  evidence 
of  the  buildings  they  constructed  and  [showing]  what  were  the  reasons 
of  their  destruction  or  their  permanence. 

And  I  shall  show  at  the  same  time  what  is  the  first  [law]  of  weight, 
and  what  and  how  many  are  the  causes  which  bring  ruin  to  buildings, 
and  what  is  the  condition  of  their  stability  and  permanence. 

But  in  order  not  to  be  diffuse  to  your  Excellencies  I  will  speak  first 
of  the  invention  of  the  first  architect  of  the  cathedral,  and  will  show 
you  clearly  what  was  his  purpose,  confirming  this  by  the  building 
which  has  been  commenced,  and  when  I  have  made  you  understand 
this  you  will  be  able  clearly  to  recognise  that  the  model  which  I  have 
constructed  possesses  in  itself  that  symmetry,  that  harmony,  and  that 
regularity  which  belongs  to  the  building  already  begun. 

What  a  building  is,  and  where  the  rules  of  sound  construction  de- 
rive their  origin,  and  what  and  how  many  are  the  parts  that  belong  to 
these.  .  .  . 

Either  I  or  some  other  who  may  expound  it  better  than  I,  choose 
him,  and  set  aside  all  partiality.  c.a.  270  r.  c

So  greatly  did  I  rejoice,  most  illustrious  Lord,  at  your  much  wished 
for  restoration  to  health  that  my  own  malady  almost  left  me,  for  which 
God  be  praised.  But  I  am  extremely  sorry  that  I  have  not  been  able 
entirely  to  satisfy  your  Excellency's  desires,  through  the  malice  of  this 
German  rogue,  as  regards  whom  I  have  left  nothing  undone  which  I 
thought  would  give  him  pleasure. 

And  in  the  first  place  his  money  was  always  paid  in  full  before  the 
date  of  the  month  at  which  his  salary  was  due;  secondly  I  invited  him 
to  lodge  and  board  with  me;  for  which  purpose  I  was  prepared  to  set 
up  a  table  at  the  foot  of  one  of  these  windows,  where  he  could  work 
with  his  file  and  finish  the  things  he  had  made  below;  and  by  this 
means  I  should  always  see  the  work  that  he  did  and  it  could  be  cor- 
rected with  ease.  And  besides  this  he  would  learn  the  Italian  language 
and  so  be  able  to  speak  it  easily  without  an  interpreter,   c.a.  283  r.  a

I  do  not  regret  so  much  my  being.  .  .  . 

I  regret  very  much  my  being  in  want,  but  I  mourn  for  it  the  more 
because  it  has  been  the  means  of  preventing  me  from  carrying  out  my 
desire,  which  has  always  been  to  obey  your  Excellency. 

I  regret  very  much  that  you  should  have  requisitioned  me  and  found 
me  in  want,  and  that  the  fact  of  my  having  to  gain  my  living  should 
have  hindered  me. 

I  regret  very  much  that  the  fact  of  my  having  to  gain  my  living 
should  have  prevented  me  from  continuing  the  work  which  your 
Highness  has  entrusted  to  me:  but  I  hope  that  within  a  short  time  I 
shall  have  earned  so  much  as  to  be  able  with  a  tranquil  mind  to  sat- 
isfy your  Excellency,  to  whom  I  commend  myself.  If  your  Highness 
thought  that  I  had  money,  you  were  deceived,  for  I  have  had  six 
mouths  to  feed  for  thirty-six  months,  and  I  have  had  fifty  ducats. 

It  may  be  that  your  Excellency  did  not  give  any  further  orders  to 
Messer  Gualtieri,  believing  that  I  had  money.  c.a.  315  v.  a

that  I  have  received  from  your  Excellency,  may  have  made  you  some- 
what indignant  with  me,  and  thus  it  is  that  I  have  written  so  many 
letters  to  your  Lordship  and  have  never  had  a  reply.  I  now  send  Salai 
to  you,  to  explain  to  your  Lordship  that  I  am  almost  at  the  end  of  the 
lawsuit  that  I  have  had  with  my  brothers,  and  that  I  expect  to  find 
myself  with  you  this  Easter,  and  to  bring  with  me  two  pictures  of  the 
Madonna,  of  different  sizes,  which  have  been  made  either  for  our  Most 
Christian  King,  or  for  whomsoever  your  Lordship  pleases.  I  should  be 
very  glad  to  know  on  my  return  there  where  I  am  to  take  up  my 
abode,  as  I  would  not  give  any  more  trouble  to  your  Lordship;  and 
also,  as  I  have  been  working  for  the  Most  Christian  King,  whether  my 
salary  is  to  continue  or  not. 

I  am  writing  to  the  President  about  that  water  which  the  King 
granted  me,  and  of  which  I  was  not  given  the  possession,  because  at 
that  time  there  was  a  shortage  in  the  canal  by  reason  of  the  great 
drought,  and  because  its  outlets  were  not  being  regulated;  but  he  gave 
me  a  definite  promise  that  when  this  was  done  I  should  be  put  in  pos- 
session, so  that  I  beseech  your  Lordship  not  to  be  unwilling  now  that 
the  outlets  are  regulated  to  remind  the  President  of  my  suit,  namely 
that  I  should  be  given  possession  of  this  water,  for  when  I  am  estab- 
lished there  I  look  forward  to  constructing  machines  and  devices  which 
should  be  a  source  of  great  pleasure  to  our  Most  Christian  King.  Noth-

Piacenza  is  a  place  of  resort  like  Florence. 

Illustrious  Commissioners  of  Buildings!  hearing  that  your  Excellen- 
cies have  resolved  upon  the  construction  of  certain  great  works  in 
bronze,  I  propose  to  offer  you  certain  counsels  on  the  subject.  First 
then  take  care  not  to  act  so  swiftly  and  hastily  in  awarding  the  com- 
mission that  by  your  speed  you  put  it  out  of  your  power  to  make  a 
good  choice  both  of  subject  and  of  a  master,  as  Italy  has  a  number  of 
men  of  capacity.  Some  fellow,  that  is,  who  by  his  incompetence  may 
afterwards  afford  occasion  to  your  successors  to  cast  blame  on  your- 
selves and  your  generation,  judging  that  this  age  was  poorly  equipped 
either  with  men  of  good  judgment  or  good  masters,  seeing  that  other 
cities  and  especially  the  city  of  the  Florentines  were  almost  at  this  very 
same  time  enriched  with  such  beautiful  and  great  works  in  bronze, 


LETTERS  1147 

amongst  these  being  the  gates  of  their  baptistery.  Florence  indeed,  like 
Piacenza,  is  a  place  oi  resort,  where  many  visitors  congregate,  and 

these  when  they  see  its  beautiful  and  stately  works  of  art  form  the  im- 
sion  that  the  city  must  have  worthy  inhabitants,  seeing  that  these 
works  serve  as  evidence  of  this;  but  they  form  quite  a  different  im- 
pression if  they  see  a  great  expenditure  in  metal  wrought  so  poorly 
that  it  would  be  less  of  a  reproach  to  the  city  if  the  doors  were  of  plain 
wood,  for  then  the  material  would  have  cost  little  and  therefore  would 
not  seem  to  require  a  great  degree  of  skill. 

Now,  the  parts  principally  sought  for  in  cities  are  their  cathedrals, 
and,  as  one  approaches  these,  the  first  objects  which  meet  the  eye  are 
their  doors  by  which  one  enters  into  the  churches. 

Beware,  gentlemen  of  the  Commission,  lest  the  too  great  speed, 
whereby  you  desire,  with  such  swiftness  as  I  perceive  you  use,  to  allot 
the  commission  for  so  important  a  work,  may  become  the  reason  why 
what  was  intended  for  the  honour  of  God  and  of  men  may  prove  a 
great  dishonour  to  your  judgment  and  to  your  city,  where  as  it  is  a 
place  of  distinction  and  of  resort  there  is  an  innumerable  concourse  of 
visitors.  This  disgrace  would  befall  you  if  by  your  negligence  you  put 
your  trust  in  some  braggart  who,  by  his  subterfuges  or  by  the  favour 
here  shown  him,  were  to  be  awarded  such  a  commission  by  you  as 
should  bring  great  and  lasting  shame  both  to  him  and  to  you. 

I  cannot  help  feeling  angry  when  I  reflect  upon  the  sort  of  men  who 
have  made  me  a  confidant  of  their  desire  to  embark  upon  such  an 
undertaking,  without  giving  a  thought  to  their  capacity  for  it — not  to 
say  more. 

One  is  a  maker  of  pots,  another  of  cuirasses,  a  third  makes  bells  and 
another  collars  for  them,  another  even  is  a  bombardier;  yet  another  is 
in  the  Duke's  household  and  boasts  that  he  is  by  way  of  being  an  inti- 
mate acquaintance  of  Messer  Ambrogio  Ferrere,  and  that  he  has  some 
influence  and  has  made  certain  promises  to  him,  and  if  this  does  not 
satisfy  you  he  will  get  on  his  horse  and  ride  off  to  the  Duke,  and  will 
get  such  letters  from  him  that  you  will  never  be  able  to  refuse  him  the 
work. 

But  consider  to  what  straits  the  poor  masters  who  by  study  have 
made  themselves  competent  to  execute  such  works  are  reduced,  when

they  have  to  contend  against  fellows  like  these!  What  hope  have  they 
of  being  able  to  look  for  reward  for  their  talent! 

Open  your  eyes  and  try  to  ensure  that  your  money  is  not  so  spent  as 
to  purchase  your  own  shame.  I  can  assure  you  that  from  this  district 
you  will  get  nothing  except  the  works  of  hard,  mean,  or  clumsy  mas- 
ters. There  is  not  a  man  who  is  capable — and  you  may  believe  me — 
except  Leonardo  the  Florentine  who  is  making  the  bronze  horse  of 
the  Duke  Francesco;  and  you  can  leave  him  out  of  your  calculations 
altogether,  for  he  has  a  work  to  do  which  will  last  him  the  whole  of 
his  life,  and  indeed  I  doubt  whether  he  will  ever  finish  it,  so  great  it  is.

much,  to  do  that  he  will  never  finish  it.

Amid  the  whirling  currents  of  the  winds  were  seen  a  great  number 
of  companies  of  birds  coming  from  distant  lands,  and  these  appeared 
in  such  a  way  as  to  be  almost  indistinguishable,  for  in  their  wheeling 
movements  at  one  time  all  the  birds  of  one  company  were  seen  edge- 
wise, that  is  showing  as  little  as  possible  of  their  bodies,  and  at  another 
time  showing  the  whole  measure  of  their  breadth,  that  is  full  in  face; 
and  at  the  time  of  their  first  appearance  they  took  the  form  of  an 
indistinguishable  cloud,  and  then  the  second  and  third  bands  became 
by  degrees  more  clearly  defined  as  they  approached  nearer  to  the  eye 
of  the  beholder. 

And  the  nearest  of  the  above-mentioned  bands  dropped  down  low 
with  a  slanting  movement,  and  settled  upon  the  dead  bodies,  which 
were  borne  along  by  the  waves  of  this  great  deluge,  and  fed  upon 
them,  and  so  continued  until  such  time  as  the  buoyancy  of  the  inflated 
dead  bodies  came  to  fail,  and  with  slow  descent  they  sank  gradually 
down  to  the  bottom  of  the  waters.1  c.a.  354  v.  b

Illustrious  President, — Having  often  remembered  the  promises  made 
Ko  me  by  your  Excellency,  I  have  several  times  thought  of  insuring

myself  by  writing  and  reminding  you  of  the  promise  made  to  me  at 
my  last  departure,  namely  as  to  the  possession  of  those  twelve  ounces 
of  water  granted  to  me  by  the  Most  Christian  King.  Your  Lordship 
knows  that  I  did  not  enter  into  possession  of  it,  because  at  the  time 
when  it  was  granted  to  me  there  was  a  dearth  of  water  in  the  canal, 
partly  on  account  of  the  great  drought  and  partly  because  the  outlets 
had  not  yet  been  regulated.  But  your  Excellency  promised  me  that 
when  this  had  taken  place  I  should  have  my  expectations  fulfilled. 
Consequently  when  I  was  given  to  understand  that  the  canal  had  been 
regulated  I  wrote  several  times  to  your  Lordship  and  to  Messer 
Girolamo  da  Cusano  who  has  the  deed  of  gift  in  his  keeping,  and  I 
wrote  also  to  Corigero,  but  have  never  had  any  reply. 

I  am  now  sending  to  you  as  bearer  of  this  [letter]  Salai,  my  pupil, 
to  whom  your  Lordship  will  be  able  to  tell  by  word  of  mouth  all  that 
has  occurred  as  regards  the  matter  in  which  I  am  petitioning  your 
Excellency. 

I  expect  to  be  with  you  this  Easter  as  I  am  almost  at  the  end  of  my 
lawsuit,  and  I  shall  bring  with  me  two  Madonna  pictures  which  I  have 
begun,  and  which  considering  the  time  at  my  disposal  I  have  brought 
to  a  very  fair  state  of  completion.  Nothing  else  occurs  to  me.  .  .  . 

My  Illustrious  Lord  [Antonio  Maria],  the  affection  which  your 
Excellency  has  always  shown  to  me  and  the  benefits  which  I  have 
received  from  you  are  continually  in  my  thoughts. 

I  have  a  suspicion  that  the  small  response  I  have  made  for  the  great 
benefits  which  I  have  received  from  your  Excellency  may  have  made 
you  somewhat  incensed  with  me;  and  that  this  is  the  reason  why  I 
have  never  had  any  reply  to  the  many  letters  that  I  have  written  to 
your  Excellency.  I  am  now  sending  Salai  to  you  to  explain  to  your 
Lordship  that  I  am  almost  at  the  end  of  my  litigation  with  my  brothers, 
and  that  I  hope  to  be  with  you  this  Easter,  and  to  bring  with  me  two 
pictures  of  the  Madonna  of  different  sizes,  which  I  have  begun  for  the 
Most  Christian  King  or  for  whomsoever  else  it  shall  please  you.  I  shall 
be  very  glad  to  know  on  my  return  there  where  I  am  to  have  my 
lodging,  because  I  would  not  wish  to  give  any  more  trouble  to  your 
Lordship,  and  further  whether  seeing  that  I  have  been  engaged  in 
work  for  the  Most  Christian  Kins:  mv  salary  is  to  continue  or  not.  I

am  writing  to  the  President  of  that  water  which  the  king  granted  me, 

of  which  1  was  not  given  possession  on  account  of  the  scarcity  in  the 
canal  due  to  the  great  drought,  and  to  the  tact  of  the  outlets  not  having 
been  regulated;  he  promised  me  however  that  as  soon  as  this  was  done 

I  should  be  put  in  possession;  so  that  I  beseech  you  if  you  should 
happen  to  meet  the  said  President  not  to  think  it  irksome,  now  that 
these  outlets  are  regulated,  to  remind  him  to  have  me  put  in  possession 
of  this  water,  since  I  am  given  to  understand  that  in  great  measure  it 
rests  with  him.  Nothing  else  occurs  to  me.  I  am  always  at  your  com- 
mands. 


Good  day  to  you,  Messer  Francesco,  God  knows  why  when  I  have 
written  you  so  many  letters  you  have  never  made  me  a  single  reply. 
Just  wait  until  I  come  to  you,  by  God,  for  I  will  make  you  write  so 
much  that  you  will  perhaps  be  sorry  for  it. 

Dear  Messer  Francesco,  I  am  sending  Salai  to  you  in  order  to  learn 
from  his  Excellency  the  President  what  conclusion  has  been  reached  in 
the  matter  of  the  regulation  of  the  water,  since  at  my  departure  the 
order  for  the  outlets  of  the  canal  had  been  set  in  hand;  because  the 
illustrious  President  promised  me  that  my  claim  should  be  settled  so 
soon  as  ever  this  adjustment  had  been  made.  It  is  now  a  considerable 
time  since  I  learnt  that  the  canal  was  set  in  working  order  and  likewise 
its  outlets,  and  I  wrote  immediately  to  the  President  and  to  you,  and 
then  repeated  my  letters,  but  have  never  had  any  reply.  Will  you  there- 
fore have  the  kindness  to  write  and  inform  me  what  has  taken  place, 
and  unless  it  is  actually  on  the  point  of  settlement,  will  you  for  my 
sake  be  so  kind  as  to  exert  a  little  pressure  on  the  President  and  also 
on  Messer  Girolamo  da  Cusano,  to  whom  please  commend  me,  and 
also  ofler  my  respects  to  his  Excellency?  c.a.  372  v.  a 

I  have  one  who  having  promised  himself  things  from  me  which 
were  not  at  all  what  he  deserved,  and  being  baulked  of  his  presump- 
tuous desire  has  tried  to  turn  all  my  friends  from  me.  And  because  he 
has  found  them  wise  and  not  pliant  to  his  will,  he  has  threatened  me 
that  he  will  spread  such  a  report x  about  me  as  will  deprive  me  of  my 
benefactors.  For  this  reason  I  have  informed  your  Lordship  of  this,  so

that  when  this  fellow  attempts  to  sow  the  usual  scandals  he  may  find 
no  ground  suitable  for  sowing  to  receive  the  thoughts  and  acts  of  his 
evil  nature.  Consequently  if  he  should  try  to  make  your  Lordship  the

[Draft  of  letter  to  hudovic  Sforza,  1482  (circa)] 

Most  Illustrious  Lord,  having  now  sufficiently  seen  and  considered 
the  proofs  of  all  those  who  count  themselves  masters  and  inventors  of 
instruments  of  war,  and  finding  that  their  invention  and  use  of  the 
said  instruments  does  not  differ  in  any  respect  from  those  in  common 
practice,  I  am  emboldened  without  prejudice  to  anyone  else  to  put 
myself  in  communication  with  your  Excellency,  in  order  to  acquaint 
you  with  my  secrets,  thereafter  offering  myself  at  your  pleasure  effectu- 
ally to  demonstrate  at  any  convenient  time  all  those  matters  which  are 
in  part  briefly  recorded  below. 

1.  I  have  plans  for  bridges,  very  light  and  strong  and  suitable  for 
carrying  very  easily,  with  which  to  pursue  and  at  times  defeat  the 
enemy;  and  others  solid  and  indestructible  by  fire  or  assault,  easy  and 
convenient  to  carry  away  and  place  in  position.  And  plans  for  burning 
and  destroying  those  of  the  enemy. 

2.  When  a  place  is  besieged  I  know  how  to  cut  off  water  from  the 
trenches,  and  how  to  construct  an  infinite  number  of  bridges,  mantlets, 
scaling  ladders  and  other  instruments  which  have  to  do  with  the  same 
enterprise. 

3.  Also  if  a  place  cannot  be  reduced  by  the  method  of  bombard- 
ment, either  through  the  height  of  its  glacis  or  the  strength  of  its  posi- 
tion, I  have  plans  for  destroying  every  fortress  or  other  stronghold 
unless  it  has  been  founded  upon  rock. 

4.  I  have  also  plans  for  making  cannon,  very  convenient  and  easy  of 
transport,  with  which  to  hurl  small  stones  in  the  manner  almost  of 
hail,  causing  great  terror  to  the  enemy  from  their  smoke,  and  great  loss 
and  confusion. 

9.  And  if  it  should  happen  that  the  engagement  was  at  sea,  I  have 
plans  for  constructing  many  engines  most  suitable  either  for  attack  or 
defence,  and  ships  which  can  resist  the  fire  of  all  the  heaviest  cannon, 
and  powder  and  smoke. 


LETTERS  1153 

5,  Also  I  have  ways  ot  arriving  .it  a  certain  fixed  spot  by  caverns  and 
secret  winding  passages,  made  without  any  noise  even  though  it  may 

be  necessary  to  pass  underneath  trenches  or  a  river. 

(>.  Also  I  can  make  armoured  ears,'  safe  and  unassailable,  which  will 
enter  the  serried  ranks  of  the  enemy  with  their  artillery,  and  there  is  no 
company  of  men  at  arms  so  great  that  they  will  not  break  it.  And 
behind  these  the  infantry  will  be  able  to  follow  quite  unharmed  and 
without  any  opposition. 

7.  Also,  if  need  shall  arise,  I  can  make  cannon,  mortars,  and  light 
ordnance,  of  very  beautiful  and  useful  shapes,  quite  different  from 
those  in  common  use. 

8.  Where  it  is  not  possible  to  employ  cannon,  I  can  supply  catapults, 
mangonels,  trabocchi  and  other  engines  of  wonderful  efficacy  not  in 
general  use.  In  short,  as  the  variety  of  circumstances  shall  necessitate,  I 
can  supply  an  infinite  number  of  different  engines  of  attack  and 
defence. 

10.  In  time  of  peace  I  believe  that  I  can  give  you  as  complete  satis- 
faction as  anyone  else  in  architecture  in  the  construction  of  buildings 
both  public  and  private,  and  in  conducting  water  from  one  place  to 
another. 

Also  I  can  execute  sculpture  in  marble,  bronze  or  clay,  and  also 
painting,  in  which  my  work  will  stand  comparison  with  that  of  anyone 
else  whoever  he  may  be. 

Moreover,  I  would  undertake  the  work  of  the  bronze  horse,  which 
shall  endue  with  immortal  glory  and  eternal  honour  the  auspicious 
memory  of  the  Prince  your  father  and  of  the  illustrious  house  of 
Sforza. 

And  if  any  of  the  aforesaid  things  should  seem  impossible  or  im- 
practicable to  anyone,  I  offer  myself  as  ready  to  make  trial  of  them  in 
your  park  or  in  whatever  place  shall  please  your  Excellency,  to  whom  I 
commend  myself  with  all  possible  humility.  c.a.  391  r.  a

Most  Illustrious  and  Most  Reverend  Lord, 

A  few  days  ago  I  arrived  from  Milan,  and  finding  that  one  of  my 
elder  brothers  refuses  to  carry  out  the  provisions  of  a  will  made  three 
years  ago  when  our  father  died:  as  also  no  less  because  I  would  not 
seem  to  myself  to  fail  in  a  matter  that  I  consider  most  urgent,  I  cannot 
forbear  to  request  of  your  most  Reverend  Highness  a  letter  of  com- 
mendation and  favour  to  Ser  Raphaello  Hieronymo,  who  is  now  one 
of  the  members  of  our  illustrious  Signoria  before  whom  my  case  is 
being  tried;  and  more  particularly  it  has  been  referred  by  his  Excel- 
lency the  Gonfaloniere  to  the  said  Ser  Raphaello,  so  that  his  Lordship 
may  be  able  to  reach  a  decision  and  bring  it  to  completion  before  the 
coming  of  the  festival  of  All  Saints. 

And  therefore,  my  Lord,  I  beseech  you,  as  earnestly  as  I  know  how 
and  am  able,  that  your  Highness  will  write  a  letter  to  the  said  Ser 
Raphaello  in  that  happy  and  engaging  manner  that  you  have  the  art

[Of  Squaring  the  Circle}

Having  for  a  long  time  sought  to  square  the  angle  of  two  curved 
sides,  that  is  the  angle  e,  which  has  two  curved  sides  of  equal  curve, 
that  is  curve  created  by  the  same  circle:  now  in  the  year  1509,  on  the 
eve  of  the  calends  of  May,  I  have  solved  the  proposition  at  ten  o'clock

the  same  value  with  the  portion  c  as  the  rectilinear  triangle  d  c  corre- 
sponds exactly  to  the  curvilinear  triangle  e  c,  I  would  call  it  the

according  to  Calvi,  between  1504  and  1506,  Leonardo  refers  to  the  multitude  of  shells 
and  corals  sticking  to  the  rocks  which  are  to  be  seen  in  the  mountains  of  Parma  and 
Piacenza.  The  passage  has  the  air  of  being  based  on  first-hand  knowledge.  If  the 
suggestion  campagna  be  accepted  it  might  be  that  Leonardo  was  revisiting  some  of  his 
old  haunts.  The  text,  however,  really  only  establishes  his  presence  at  Parma  on  the  date 
mentioned.  As  such,  it  proves  that  his  stay  in  Rome  was  interrupted.  Dated  references 
attest  his  presence  there  on  the  seventh  of  July  1514,  and  as  late  as  August  151 6. 
The  visit  to  Parma  may  possibly  have  been  connected  with  the  fact  that  Parma  was  one 
of  the  papal  cities  of  which  Giuliano  de'  Medici,  Leonardo's  patron  in  Rome,  had  been 
made  the  governor.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL  NOTES 

The  existence  of  this  list  of  books  on  a  page  of  the  Codice  Atlantico 
affords  fair  ground  for  the  supposition  that  Leonardo  was  enumerating 
the  books  which  he  possessed. 

Marchese  Girolamo  d'Adda,  from  whose  erudition  as  displayed  in  a 
rare  tract — Leonardo  da  Vinci  e  la  sua  Libreria — note  di  tin  Bibliofilo, 
Milano  1873 — the  notes  that  follow  are  mainly  derived,  has  suggested 
that  as  Leonardo  uses  the  Italian  and  not  the  classical  form  of  the 
names  of  classical  authors  he  may  be  supposed  to  be  referring  to  Italian 
translations.  I  cannot  think  that  this  inference  necessarily  holds,  any 
more  than  it  would  in  the  case  of  a  modern  writer  who  might  use  the 
forms  Virgil  and  Horace  in  a  list  of  books.  There  were,  however,  in 
existence  Italian  translations  of  all  the  classical  works  mentioned,  and 
any  of  these  may  have  been  in  Leonardo's  possession.  D'Adda's  wealth 
of  bibliographical  knowledge  causes  his  descriptions  of  the  various 
works  in  the  list  to  serve  as  an  'open  sesame'  to  Leonardo's  library.  The 
notes  that  follow  fall  by  contrast  under  the  censure  that  Leonardo 
invoked  on  those  who  make  epitomes: —

1  In  the  introduction  to  his  edition  of  the  Leicester  Manuscript,  Gerolamo  Calvi 
suggests  that  these  two  lines  refer  to  the  search  for  and  possession  of  a  copy  of  one  of 
the  works  of  Ramon  Lull,  the  Majorcan  philosopher  and  mystic.  This  seems  to  offer  a 
probable  explanation  of  lines  which  otherwise  form  an  enigma.  An  edition  of  Lull's 
Ars  generalis  ultima  was  printed  in  Venice  in  the  year  1480,  others  of  his  works  ap- 
peared in  Rome  and  Barcelona.  Leonardo  may  however  have  been  in  quest  of  one  of  his 
manuscripts.  The  so-called  'Lullian  method',  an  attempt  to  supply  a  mechanical  aid  to 
the  mind  in  the  acquisition  of  knowledge  by  combinations  formed  by  revolving  circles, 
was  dismissed  in  a  couple  of  sentences  by  Francis  Bacon:  'Any  sciolist  may  make  some 
show  and  ostentation  of  learning.  Such  was  the  art  of  Lullius'.  The  'doctor  illuminatus", 
as  he  was  styled,  is  to-day  a  mere  name  in  the  history  of  philosophy,  and  such  interest 
as  exists  in  him  centres  in  his  work  as  poet  and  mystic.  His  latest  biographer,  Professor 
Peers,  devotes  a  chapter  each  to  his  romances  Blanquerna  and  Felix  and  a  single  page  to 
his  formidable  Ars  Generalis.  But  although  the  mechanical  contrivances  associated  with 
the  'Lullian  method'  sufficed  deservedly  to  discredit  it,  Lull  as  a  thinker  broke  from  the 
restraints  of  the  schoolmen,  and  as  the  titles  of  certain  chapters  in  his  treatises  serve  to 
show,  the  workings  of  his  curiosity  concerning  the  laws  of  operation  of  natural  forces 
offer  many  parallels  to  the  writings  of  Leonardo.  The  field  of  his  activities  in  science 
included  geometry,  astronomy,  physics,  chemistry,  anthropology,  the  causes  of  wind  and 
rain,  the  laws  of  navigation,  and  warfare.  He  was  not  unlike  Roger  Bacon  in  the  extraor- 
dinary scope  of  his  scientific  interests;  the  two  lines  in  which  Leonardo  expresses  his 
desire  to  possess  a  work  of  Ramon  Lull  may  be  paralleled  with  the  sentence,  also  in  the 
Arundel  Manuscript  B.M.  71  v,  'Roger  Bacon  done  into  print'.  Leonardo  may  very 
probably  have  owed  the  first  awakening  of  his  interest  in  the  work  of  both  to  the  fact  of 
his  association  in  study  with  Fra  Luca  Pacioli,  who  belonged  to  the  Franciscan  order,  as 
did  also  Lull  and  Bacon,  and  who  was  therefore  the  more  likely  to  have  acquaintance 
with  their  works. 

2  Nonius  Marcellus  and  Sextus  Pompeius  Festus  were  Roman  Grammarians  of  about

authors  printed  at  Parma  in  1480.

The  action  of  cutting  the  nostrils  of  horses  is  a  practice  worthy  of

men  have  to  be  her  correctors. 

Nature  has  made  the  two  holes  in  the  nose,  each  of  which  is  half  the 
width  of  the  pipe  from  the  lungs  by  which  the  hard  breathing  goes 
out;  and  if  these  holes  were  not  there  the  mouth  would  suffice  for  this 
abundance  of  breathing. 

And  if  you  should  ask  me  why  nature  has  made  the  nostril  thus  in 
animals,  when  the  breathing  through  the  mouth  is  sufficient,  my  reply

El  vin  sia  temprato,  poco  e  spesso,

If  you  wish  to  make  a  paste  out  of  small  pearls  take  the  juice  of  some

solved.  And  when  it  has  all  settled  throw  away  the  lemon  juice  and 
put  fresh,  and  do  this  two  or  three  times,  so  that  the  paste  may  be  very 
fine.  Then  wash  the  said  paste  with  clear  water  a  sufficient  number  of 
times  for  it  to  lose  all  trace  of  the  lemon  juice.  After  doing  this  let  the 
paste  dry  so  that  it  turns  to  powder.  Then  take  white  of  egg,  beat  it 
well  and  leave  it  to  settle,  and  then  moisten  the  said  powder  with  this 
so  that  it  becomes  a  paste  again. 

And  from  this  you  can  make  pearls  as  large  as  you  wish,  and  leave 
them  to  dry.  Then  place  them  in  a  small  turning  lathe  and  polish 
them,  if  you  wish  with  a  dog's  tooth,  or  if  you  prefer  with  a  polishing 
stick  of  crystal  or  chalcedony. 

And  polish  it  until  it  has  the  same  lustre  that  it  had  before.  And  I 
believe  that  if  you  dissolve  mother-of-pearl  you  get  the  same  result  as 
with  the  pearls.  c.a.  109  v.  b

the  fact  that  the  legs  when  less  submerged  are  less  impeded,  and  conse-

[Sensibility  of  the  hair  of  the  ox] 

The  hair  of  the  ox  placed  in  stagnant  water  in  summer  acquires 
sensation  and  life  and  movement  of  itself,  and  also  the  power  of  fear 
and  flight  and  perception  of  pain.  And  the  proof  is  that  if  it  is  pressed 
it  twists  and  releases  itself.  Place  it  again  in  the  water,  as  before  it  takes 
to  flight  and  removes  itself  from  the  danger.  k  81  [1]  r. 

SCENTLESS  OIL 

To  take  away  the  smell  from  oil: 

Take  some  crude  oil  and  put  ten  pints  of  it  in  a  vessel.  Make  a 
mark  on  the  vessel  according  to  the  height  of  the  oil,  and  then  pro- 
ceed to  add  a  pint  of  vinegar,  and  boil  until  the  oil  has  gone  down  as 
low  as  the  mark  that  was  made.  By  this  means  you  will  be  sure  that 
the  oil  has  come  back  to  its  first  amount  and  that  all  the  vinegar  has 
evaporated,  and  has  carried  all  the  bad  smell  away  with  it.

1The  note  'buildings  by  Bramante',  in  view  of  the  fact  that  those  which  follow  relate 
to  untoward  events  consequent  upon  the  imprisonment  of  Ludovic  Sforza,  refers  possibly 
to  the  fact  of  various  works  designed  by  Bramante  being  left  uncompleted,  e.g.  accord- 
ing to  Amoretti  one  side  only  of  the  Canonica  di  S.  Ambrogio  was  built,  and  the  col- 
umns for  the  rest  lay  there  for  upwards  of  a  century.  According  to  the  same  authority  the 
reference  to  the  governor  of  the  castle  was  in  all  probability  to  the  French  governor,  who 
on  the  return  of  the  French  was  thrown  into  prison  for  having  surrendered  to  Ludovic 
when  his  troops  reoccupied  the  city;  he  cites  the  names  of  two  Visconti  from  Arluno's 
chronicle  who  were  carried  off  as  captives  into  France  for  having  taken  the  side  of  the 
Duke;  Gian  della  Rosa  he  identifies  with  Giovanni  da  Rosate,  professor  at  Pavia,  the 
Duke's  physician  and  astrologer;  and  Borgonzo  with  Brugonzio  Botta,  the  administrator 
of  the  ducal  revenue,  whose  house  was  pillaged  by  the  French  partisans  on  his  flight. 

The  notes  end  with  Leonardo's  laconic  epitaph  upon  the  fallen  fortunes  of  Ludovic 
Sforza,  who  at  the  time  they  were  written  was  a  prisoner  at  Loches  in  Touraine,  where 
he  remained  until  his  death.

mans  at  the  storming  of  Syracuse,  did  not  fail  to  be  offered  very  great 

rewards  by  these  same  Romans.  And  at  the  sack,  of  Syracuse  diligent 
search  was  made  for  Archimedes,  and  when  he  was  iound  to  be  dead 
there  was  a  greater  lament  made  in  the  senate  and  among  the  Roman 
people  than  if  they  had  lost  all  their  army,  and  they  did  not  fail  to 
honour  him  with  obsequies  and  statue,  their  leader  being  Marcus 
Marcellus. 

And  after  the  second  destruction  of  Syracuse  the  tomb  of  this  same

orately; and  as  to  this  Cato  is  recorded  to  have  said  that  he  did  not

This  conclusion  is  universal  and  it  avails  for  the  flow  and  ebb  to 
prove  that  the  sun  or  moon  impresses  itself  so  much  the  more  upon 
the  object,  that  is  upon  the  waters,  as  they  are  of  less  depth;  and  there- 
fore the  shallow  waters  of  the  marshes  must  receive  the  cause  of  the

ocean.

To  have  two  boxes  made  to  go  on  a  pack  saddle. 

1  The  fact  may  perhaps  not  be  without  significance  that  this  memorandum,  which  the 
order  of  arrangement  of  passages  from  the  various  manuscripts  has  caused  to  come  at  the 
end  of  this  book,  contains  two  sentences  in  which,  alongside  the  record  of  matters  of 
daily  import,  there  is  a  deeper  note  discernible  and  one  which,  as  it  seems,  sounds  in 
unison  across  the  centuries.  In  the  words  'to  go  to  make  arrangements  for  my  garden' 
{andare  in  provitionc  per  il  mio  giardino)  there  is  a  curious  similarity  to  the  words  as 
almost  to  the  mood  of  thought  that  finds  expression  in  the  apophthegm  in  Candide  'il 
faut  cultiver  notre  jardin'.  Each  perhaps  may  contain  the  formula  of  renunciation. 

So  also  in  like  manner  the  third  line  of  the  memorandum  'the  reconciler  of  the  flow 
and  ebb  of  the  sea'  seems  to  me  to  link  itself  unforgettably  in  the  memory  with  two 
lines  of  Keats: — 

'The  moving  waters  at  their  priestlike  task 
Of  pure   ablution   round   earth's   human   shores'. 
The  two  present  essentially  the  same  image.  If  you  surrender  to  them  they  have  the 
same  beauty  of  suggestion. 

With  Leonardo,  however,  the  mood  changed.  Any  thought  of  the  movement  of  water 
might  give  rein  to  practical  considerations  as  to  possibilities  oc  harnessing  its  power  for

public  utility.  The  last  line  of  the  memorandum  is  'a  b  flow  and  ebb  of  the  waters, 
proved  at  the  mill  of  Vanrio',  the  letters  having  reference  to  a  small  drawing  of 
hydraulic  apparatus  immediately  at  the  side  of  the  page.  If  Vanrio  may  be  interpreted  as 
Vaprio,  the  reference  would  be  to  the  waters  of  the  Adda,  to  the  mill  at  Vaprio  on  the 
Adda,  Vaprio  being  the  country  home  of  the  Melzi  family,  a  member  of  which— 
Francesco  Melzi — became  like  an  adopted  son  to  Leonardo.  It  was  to  Vaprio  that 
Leonardo,  during  the  later  years  of  his  life  in  Milan,  frequently  went  in  order  to  pursue 
research  in  quiet.  Were  this  memorandum  a  record  of  impulses,  the  word  beretta  (cap), 
which  concludes  it,  coming  immediately  after  the  mention  of  the  mill  might  almost 
suggest  that  he  was  thinking  of  going  there.
